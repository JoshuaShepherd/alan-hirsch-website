Metanoia Course on the Movemental LMS: Holistic Design and Build Prompt (no new database mapping)

Project purpose
Build the Metanoia learning journey into the same cohort-based LMS used for Movemental Thinking—so leaders actually undergo metanoia: a Spirit-enabled conversion of mind, soul, and will that translates a new paradigm into platform (culture + structures) and reproducible practices. The course must intentionally guide learners down the U-curve (unlearning) and up again (rebuilding), with artifacts and rhythms that embed ongoing metanoia as a way of life and organizational design, not a one-off insight 【】.

Theological-pedagogical anchors we must reflect in product design

Metanoia is grace: an ongoing reorientation that opens access to the “mind of Christ,” changing how we see and decide in the world; the course must train perception and action, not just transfer ideas 【】.
Change follows a U-shaped curve: unravel/uncover/unlock/understand → paradigm/platform/practices/perform; the LMS flow must embody both descent and ascent, with community processing and action steps each cycle 【】.
Meta-ideas (mDNA) drive movements: Jesus is Lord; disciple-making; missional-incarnational impulse; APEST culture; organic systems; liminality–communitas. The platform must help leaders surface and align these meta-ideas with force-field analysis (boosters/blockers) 【】.
Platform = Culture + Structures: design the “collective soul” and organizational scaffolding so new behavior emerges naturally; diffusion then carries change beyond innovators to early adopters and into the early majority 【】.
Act your way into new thinking: values must become rhythms → habits → algorithms the whole system can reproduce; embed feedback loops and childlike learning for ongoing metanoia 【】.
Outcomes for learners (what success looks like)

Identity: Leaders name and repent of attractional/institutional defaults, embrace church-as-movement, and take up childlike, learning-organization postures 【】【】.
Paradigm clarity: Teams articulate a one-page mental map (seed) centered on mDNA meta-ideas and the mind of Christ 【】【】.
Platform shifts: Leaders publish a Platform Charter (culture norms + structural changes) that empowers the edges and removes blockers to missional engagement 【】【】.
Practices codified: Core values become 3–5 reproducible rhythms (algorithms) with coaching cadences and feedback loops; practice changes beat rhetoric 【】.
Diffusion & durability: A 90-day Perform plan implements two blocker removals, one platform shift, and one practice algorithm at the edge; anti-drift safeguards are defined 【】.
Course architecture in the LMS (no new DB schema; integrate into existing system)

Delivery: Cohort-based, 8 modules, each with Learn (framework), Tool (practice), Experiment (field), Report (peer coaching), mirroring the movemental LMS cadence.
Group process: Standardize Explore → Evaluate → Employ → Journal in every session to move from understanding to action 【】.
Artifacts: Each module yields a tangible artifact scored by rubric; artifacts power analytics and the Metanoia Scorecard.
Module map: Downcurve → Upcurve
Downcurve: Unlearning and Lament

Goal
Implement the Metanoia course on the existing Movemental LMS using current auth/content/analytics endpoints. Reuse course player, cohort space, and toolkit patterns; add Metanoia-specific components, workflows, and analytics panels. Do not create or modify database schemas—persist via existing APIs.

Deliverables

Course structure
Create an 8-module course entry with lessons and content placeholders.
Wire lesson flow to support Learn → Tool → Experiment → Report pattern per module.
2. Components (Tiptap nodes and UI)

Implement the following Tiptap nodes with toolbar actions, autosave via existing content APIs, and PDF export:
ForceFieldCanvas, SeedTreeForestCanvas, BlockersInventory, LamentLiturgy, PlatformCharter, PracticesAlgorithm, PerspectiveExercise, MovementVsInstitutionAudit, PerformPlan90.
Add rubric viewer/editor for artifacts; enable facilitator comments and version history.
3. Cohort and facilitation

Add a “Perform Board” view (kanban) to track blocker removals, platform shifts, and practice deployments.
Add a Cohort Session template pre-populated with Explore → Evaluate → Employ → Journal prompts.
4. AI coaching and nudges

Configure agent prompts specific to each module and component (see list above).
Surface context-aware suggestions when a user completes a canvas or gets stuck (e.g., if no blockers listed, suggest Uncover prompts).
5. Analytics and Scorecard (UI only; consume existing analytics endpoints)

Create “Metanoia Scorecard” panel with tiles for:
Perception shifts (count of completed PerspectiveExercises).
Blockers removed (completed items in BlockersInventory with “resolved” status).
Seed/Tree/Forest artifact submissions and rubric averages.
Practices deployed (PracticesAlgorithm with “live” status).
Diffusion progress (counts tagged as “innovator/early adopter” engaged).
Anti-drift safeguards defined (MovementVsInstitutionAudit completion).
Journal cadence adherence (Explore–Evaluate–Employ–Journal completion).
6. Accessibility and export

Ensure all canvases meet keyboard and screen-reader requirements; include aria labels for draggable items.
Single-click PDF export for each artifact with course/citation footers.
7. Content seeding

Import initial micro-teach text, scripture quotes, and citations for each module.
Load template versions of all canvases and rubrics.
Constraints

Do not alter database schema. Use existing endpoints for:
Content storage and retrieval.
Cohort membership and roles.
Artifacts and file storage.
Analytics read endpoints (where missing, mock UI with local state for pilot).
Follow shadcn UI patterns, Tailwind utility classes, and existing theming.
Acceptance criteria

A learner can complete Module 2 by: (a) journaling a lament; (b) submitting a BlockersInventory with at least 3 blockers; (c) receiving facilitator feedback; (d) seeing their Metanoia Scorecard update “Blockers identified” and “Journal cadence.”
A team can complete Module 5 by: (a) submitting a PlatformCharter with at least 3 culture norms and 2 structural changes; (b) assigning owners and dates; (c) adding one diffusion step for innovators/early adopters.
A cohort can view the “Perform Board” and move one practice algorithm card to “Live,” which updates the Scorecard.
All artifacts export to PDF; PDFs include cohort, module, artifact title, and citation footer.
Keyboard-only navigation works across canvas nodes; screen-reader announces key controls.
Pilot plan

Seed a Founders’ Cohort; run Modules 1–3 over six weeks; collect usability feedback on canvases, lament liturgy, and force-field flow.
Iterate UI/UX; then enable Modules 4–8 with Scorecard tiles.
Train facilitators on using the Explore → Evaluate → Employ → Journal cadence, and on reviewing artifacts with rubrics.
Why this build is faithful to Metanoia

It operationalizes the U-curve with liturgy, lament, and honest diagnosis before rebuilding—exactly the journey Metanoia prescribes 【】【】.
It translates paradigm into platform and practices through Seed–Tree–Forest and Platform = Culture + Structures—matching the book’s “hinge” from ideas to embodied systems 【】【】.
It trains perception (mind of Christ) and childlike learning, making ongoing metanoia the expected norm in a learning organization 【】【】.
