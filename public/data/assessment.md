Gauge the degree to which leaders and their teams are embodying, practicing, and thinking movementally according to Alan Hirsch’s paradigm: Apostolic Genius (mDNA), APEST, missional-incarnational living, organic systems, communitas, cultural translation, multiplication, and change leadership beyond Christendom. The MFA blends self-ratings, 360 peer input, and artifact-based rubrics. It is action-biased and designed to drive next steps where mDNA is weakest, in keeping with Hirsch’s guidance to use the Apostolic Genius typology for strategic focus and to act our way into new thinking 【】.

Submit artifacts; a reviewer (coach/facilitator) scores with rubrics below. Weight these rubrics significantly—they prove movement beyond content.

Artifact 1. APEST Team Plan and Matrix
Evidence: named base profiles; team heatmap; functional team charters (A/P/E/S/T) and rhythms; open learning system usage 【】【】.
Rubric:

0: No plan; ST dominance; roles unclear.

3: Multi-frame articulation with practice implications; iterative refinement.
4: Community-owned, widely used, and effective across cultures; exported to other leaders.
Administration notes and integrations

If you use the official APEST profile or team tools, record base results in Artifact 1; Hirsch commends APEST profiling as a clarifying tool for vocation and team design 【】.
If you are licensed for the mPULSE test, include that result in Artifact 3’s OS Canvas mDNA audit; Hirsch lists mPULSE as a missional assessment option to read Apostolic Genius/mDNA presence 【】.
Scoring and interpretation

Domain scores: Average the item scores within each domain (1–4).
360 adjustment: For each domain with 360 items, compute peer average and adjust the domain by ±0.2 if peer and self differ by ≥0.5 (cap total adjustment at ±0.4).
Artifact scores: Each rubric scored 0–4. Compute Artifact Average.
Composite MFA: 60% Likert (nine-domain average after 360 adjustment) + 40% Artifact Average.
Color bands (Composite MFA and domain-level)

3.2–4.0 Movement-aligned: Sustain feedback loops and guard against drift back to institutional maintenance.
2.4–3.1 Emerging movement: Pick the two lowest-scoring mDNA-aligned domains and focus there (Hirsch: strengthen the weakest element next) 【】.
0–2.3 Stalled: Start at the center (Jesus is Lord; disciple-making) and simplify structures; embed APEST rhythms to regain movemental energy 【】【】.
Cohort debrief and action plan
Use Hirsch’s group learning process each cycle—Explore, Evaluate, Employ, Journal—to move insight into action 【】.

Debrief guide (60–90 minutes)

Explore: Where are we strongest/weakest? What surprised us? (share highlights from MFA report)
Evaluate: What’s our one mDNA element to strengthen next? What blockers must be removed? 【】
Employ: Commit to a 90-day experiment tied to that domain; name owner, start date, first step.
Journal: Pray, listen, and write personal commitments; share a prayer of desire and dependence.
APEST “thinking hats” facilitation (for decision sprints)
Cycle the team through apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching lenses before deciding. Rotate facilitation so each hat gets airtime; this game-like method removes defensiveness and ensures the whole body’s counsel is heard 【】.

Open learning dynamics in meetings
Consciously run the fit/split/contend/transcend pattern: reaffirm unity (fit), welcome diverse APEST inputs (split), honestly debate (contend), then name a shared way forward (transcend) 【】.

Appendix: Item index by mDNA element

Jesus is Lord (A1, A8, I1), Disciple-making (C1–C8), Missional-incarnational (D1–D6), APEST (B1–B10), Organic systems (E1–E8), Communitas (F1–F6). Hirsch emphasizes that all elements must be present systemically; avoid “silver bullets.” Use the typology to target weakest areas and iterate toward movement fitness 【】.
Why this instrument is faithful to Hirsch

It combines the two missional assessment tools he explicitly commends (APEST and an mDNA gauge like mPULSE) with an action-first, community-processed approach that moves beyond content to lived practice 【】【】.
It treats APEST as the theo-genetic code for maturity and adaptability and encodes open learning dynamics (fit/split/contend/transcend) as a core competency 【】【】.
It measures reproducible disciple-making, incarnational mission, organic systems, communitas, contextualization (glocal gospel), multiplication, and change leadership—hallmark emphases of Hirsch’s movemental paradigm 【】【】【】【】【】.
Notes on optional integrations

If you already use apest.org or a licensed APEST profile, map those results into Domain B and Artifact 1; Hirsch affirms statistically validated APEST profiles as clarifying tools for vocational identity and team design 【】.
If you have access to the mPULSE test or The Forgotten Ways “missional fitness” tools, include those scores under Artifact 3’s mDNA audit; Hirsch publicly references these resources as aids to missional assessment 【】【】.
Delivery options

Paper or digital survey; artifact uploads for rubrics; optional cohort facilitator dashboard to aggregate team and regional results into a Movemental Scorecard aligned with Hirsch’s categories (identity language, APEST balance, practice adoption, multiplication, communitas, contextualization) 【】【】.
