Movemental Thinking for Network Leaders (Advanced): An LMS Ecosystem Proposal

Executive intent
Design a digital-first, cohort-based learning system that moves Alan’s ideas from bookshelf to behavior across a multi-region network. The program is built to deliver a Framework → Practice → System journey, embed peer learning, and equip leaders with customizable, reproducible tools. It explicitly operationalizes mDNA and APEST within a scalable “movement operating system,” not a static archive. Alan’s work insists on paradigmatic recalibration from institution to movement and provides the theological-organizational scaffolding to do so; our LMS will translate that into lived practice and reproducible systems at scale (movemental paradigm in The Forgotten Ways; APEST as the theo-genetic code in The Permanent Revolution; communitas, organic systems, and group learning patterns)    .

Program outcomes (aligned to your requested outcomes)
By the end of the journey, leaders will:

Identity and mindset
Articulate church-as-movement over church-as-institution and name the implications for leadership, structure, and mission (movemental shift) .
Internalize mDNA as the “apostolic genius” of movements (Jesus is Lord, disciple-making, missional-incarnational impulse, APEST, organic systems, communitas) and see themselves as catalysts, not mere managers .
2. Movemental framework mastery

Explain core ideas from The Forgotten Ways, 5Q, and The Permanent Revolution in their own words; diagnose where current systems align or resist movement DNA (including Christendom assumptions) .
3. Practical implementation skills

Run at least one reproducible disciple-making practice (e.g., LTGs, Discovery Bible, oikos mapping) and facilitate an APEST team conversation to identify gaps in fivefold functioning; counter consumerism with discipleship practices that form “little Jesuses” .
4. Multiplication capacity

Produce a contextual multiplication pathway for groups/leaders/communities (moving from addition to multiplication), grounded in organic systems thinking and movement design principles .
5. Team and system integration

Implement one APEST-aligned leadership structure and embed coaching feedback loops that sustain growth and innovation across the network .
6. Cohort-driven outcomes

Leave with peer-tested strategies, accountability for one 90-day movemental experiment, and a plan for network roll-out that can be trained by others (not personality-dependent) .

Link practices to case examples (LTGs; new monastic forms) to counter consumerism and form disciple-makers .
Embed the OS metaphor and group-process patterns directly into tools and templates so leaders translate paradigm into system and habit .
Pilot and rollout (for your 250-church network)

Phase 1: Founders’ Cohort (12–15 leaders). Target outcomes: one APEST-aligned team per leader; two reproducible practices deployed; shared Movement OS Canvas per church.
Phase 2: Regional Catalysts (30–40 leaders). Focus: train-the-trainers; seed pods; replicate toolkits.
Phase 3: Network Scale. Publish white-labeled micro-courses for small groups and leader tracks; set minimum viable rhythms (LTG adoption; APEST team normalization; quarterly communitas labs; multiplication reviews).
What makes this an ecosystem, not an archive

Theology-to-Tool-to-System mapping in every lesson.
Cohort structure with accountability and facilitation baked-in (Explore → Evaluate → Employ → Journal) .
Customizable assets ready for immediate redeployment.
Network analytics that track multiplication and culture change, not just completion.
APEST as the core operating logic for leadership distribution and innovation capacity .
Why this is faithful to Alan’s work

It centers the missional identity of the church and calls leaders to apostolic imagination and practice (not institutional maintenance) .
It activates mDNA through habits, practices, and group processes—exactly how The Forgotten Ways frames activation, not mere theory .
It leverages organic systems, communitas, and reproducible patterns to catalyze multiplication across decentralized networks .
Next steps

Approve the 10-module scope and cohort cadence.
Identify 12–15 leaders for the Founders’ Cohort and nominate 3–5 facilitators.
Provide initial APEST and mDNA baseline data (quick surveys) to calibrate the first dashboards.
Greenlight build of the LMS skeleton per the developer prompt above; seed with Module 1 content and the Movement OS Canvas template.
If your people finish this journey able to think like movement leaders, practice reproducible disciple-making, and embed multiplication DNA into your system, then we’ve succeeded—in Hirsch’s terms, shifting from institution to movement and reactivating apostolic genius for your whole network  .
