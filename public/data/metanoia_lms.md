If Metanoia does in this course what Alan intends the book to do, learners will undergo a real conversion of mind, soul, and will that reorients their leadership, teams, and organizations toward movement. They will unlearn inherited Christendom defaults, receive the “mind of Christ,” architect movemental platforms (culture + structures), and codify practices that actually multiply—then keep doing this again as a way of life, not a one-off event    .

What the learner’s response would look like (if Metanoia’s intent lands through this course)

A wholehearted turn: Leaders actively bring mind, soul, and will under Jesus’ lordship, shifting from “institutional maintenance” to a movemental imagination; they name and release idols/ideologies and become undivided in allegiance to God’s mission .
A genuine unlearning: They consciously descend the U-curve—unravel, uncover, unlock, understand—lamenting where they’ve resisted mission, surfacing deep blockers, and letting go of obsolete mental maps and practices that no longer serve the gospel .
A new way of seeing: They experience metanoia as access to the mind of Christ—shifting perspective from merely human logic to Christo-logic—and practice seeing like Jesus in concrete areas (power, money, enemies, leadership) with guided exercises .
A re-architected platform: They redesign “platform” (culture + structures) so their paradigm naturally becomes practice—moving from attractional “come-to-us” defaults that block mission to missional “go-to-them” systems that empower people at the edges .
A codified set of practices: They translate values into rhythms and tools, turning habits into reproducible “algorithms,” so movement does not depend on personalities; they act their way into new thinking and embed it organization-wide .
A learning-organization posture: They leave as childlike, curious innovators who expect ongoing metanoia, build feedback loops, and steward diffusion from innovators → early adopters → early majority across their network .
What would need to happen in the course to get there

Guide them through the U-curve, not around it. The course must deliberately take learners down into unlearning (unravel → uncover → unlock → understand) with space for lament (“gift of tears”) and diagnostic honesty about blockers that keep “missional intent” captive to attractional systems .
Surface and align meta-ideas (mDNA). Help leaders identify their core meta-ideas—Jesus is Lord, disciple-making, missional-incarnational impulse, APEST culture, organic systems, liminality/communitas—and align them so an emergent movemental system can form .
Use force-field analysis on the current system. Make them map “boosters” and “blockers” around those meta-ideas; name three to five blockers; and commit to removing them in the next 90 days .
Move from paradigm to platform to practices to perform. Coach teams through the upcurve: articulate their new mental map (seed), build culture/structures (tree), codify rhythms/tools (forest), and then scale and sustain—guarding against organizational “muscle memory” that drags them back .
Embed theological seeing. Facilitate “mind of Christ” exercises that train perception and judgment, not just knowledge transmission; help them test assumptions against Jesus’ teaching in concrete domains .
Normalize childlike learning and diffusion. Frame change as sanctification, cultivate beginner’s mind, then plan diffusion beyond the innovators through platforms that carry practice, not just ideas .
Make the journey spiritual and communal. Keep prayer, discernment, and communal confession central; metanoia is grace-enabled and must be processed as a body, not solo .
What content needs to be shared/taught—and how
Teach the Metanoia Journey in four movements with integrated practice labs and artifacts that prove translation from paradigm to system.

Movement 1. Metanoia as grace and gateway to the mind of Christ

Teach
Biblical/theological vision of metanoia as ongoing conversion of mind, soul, will; not remorse, but re-centering in God and forward-looking hope .
Metanoia as access to “the mind of Christ” and a Christo-logic perspective that reorders perception and decision-making .
How
Short teachings plus guided “Testing Perspective” exercises on money, power, enemies, leadership; journaling and prayer to habituate seeing as Jesus sees .
Movement 2. The Downcurve: Unlearning and lament

Teach
The U-curve of change; why unlearning is prerequisite to relearning; how wicked problems expose needed repentance .
“Uncover” and “Unlock” stages with key questions and a hacker’s mindset toward systemic ruts and legacy assumptions .
How
Lab: Uncover/Unlock with key-question prompts; corporate lament liturgy; story-sharing about attractional blockers and how they cancel missional intent .
Artifact: Blockers Inventory (3–5 items) + initial repentance/response plan.
Movement 3. The Upcurve: Paradigm → Platform → Practices → Perform

Teach
Meta-ideas (mDNA) as organizational DNA; force-field analysis; the seed–tree–forest model (mind–soul–will) .
Platform = culture + structures; why platforms cause new behavior to emerge naturally; diffusion of innovation in organizational change .
From core values to core practices to “algorithms” that scale and stick; acting our way into new thinking .
How
Lab: Force-field analysis for each meta-idea; design boosters and eliminate blockers .
Lab: Platform design sprint (culture norms + structural shifts that empower edges) with a one-page Platform Charter .
Lab: Practices codification—turn 3–5 rhythms into step-by-step algorithms for reproducibility; plan feedback loops and review cadences .
Artifact set:
Seed: New Mental Map (one-page paradigm statement) .
Tree: Platform Charter (culture norms + structural changes) .
Forest: Practices Playbook (rhythms → algorithms) with metrics and coaching cadence .
Movement 4. Movement vs. Institution and sustained metanoia

Teach
Contrast features of movemental vs. institutional paradigms; how to guard against drift and “muscle memory” after initial gains .
Childlikeness, learning-organization dynamics, and ongoing cycles of metanoia as the permanent posture of the church .
How
Lab: Movement vs. Institution audit; identify three concrete anti-drift safeguards.
Diffusion plan: Identify innovators/early adopters/early majority; design a platform-enabled rollout that carries practice, not just content .
Artifact: 90-day Perform Plan with two blockers removed, one platform shift enacted, and at least one practice algorithm deployed at the edge (with feedback loop).
Why this approach matches Metanoia’s intent

It treats change as grace-fueled conversion (not technique), requiring unlearning, paradigm clarity, platform architecture, and practice codification—exactly the Metanoia Journey’s logic (downcurve then upcurve) .
It centers the mind of Christ and trains seeing, so leaders don’t merely know new ideas but perceive and act differently in concrete domains of life and leadership .
It insists theology must translate into lived culture and structure, overcoming the wide gap Alan names between “missional talk” and real practice .
It equips leaders to become learning organizations with childlike curiosity and ongoing metanoia—so the change continues after the course ends .
If we deliver these experiences, the learner’s response will be the very fruit Metanoia seeks: hearts turned, minds renewed, wills engaged—resulting in movemental platforms and practices that multiply, and a community ready to keep repenting and renewing as a way of life.
