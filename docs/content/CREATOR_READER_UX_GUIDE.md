# IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

# DECISION FRAMEWORK

For any feature decision, ask:

1. **Does this directly serve the creator or reader's core job-to-be-done?**
2. **Can we measure its impact on our success metrics?**
3. **Is this the simplest solution that could work?**
4. **Can we ship this in <2 weeks?**

If any answer is "no," either simplify or deprioritize.

---

**Remember:** The goal is not to build every possible feature, but to build the right features exceptionally well. Focus on the core loop: Creator makes great content → Readers discover and engage → Some become paying members → Creator gets feedback and resources to make more great content.
