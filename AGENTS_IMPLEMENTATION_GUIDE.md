**Implementation Pattern:**
1. Import realtime client from vendor directory
2. Set up WebSocket connection with OpenAI Realtime API
3. Implement streaming response handling
4. Create conversational UI components

### 3. WebSocket Client (`openai-realtime-api-beta-main/`)

**Core Capabilities:**
- Low-level WebSocket connection management
- Event handling for real-time communication
- Audio processing and streaming
- Conversation state management

- Provide personalized content recommendations
- Track user journey through the platform

**Multi-Modal Interactions:**
- Text-based conversations
- Visual content recommendations
- Interactive assessment interfaces

**Integration Points:**
- Supabase for user data and conversation history
- OpenAI for natural language processing
- Custom APIs for content retrieval

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Agent Class Structure
```typescript
// Based on vendor/openai-agents-js-main patterns
import { Agent } from '@vendor/openai-agents-js-main/packages/agents'
import { OpenAIProvider } from '@vendor/openai-agents-js-main/packages/agents-openai'

class AlanHirschAgent extends Agent {
  // Implement core agent functionality
}
```

### 2. Streaming Setup
```typescript
// Based on vendor/openai-realtime-agents-main patterns
import { RealtimeClient } from '@vendor/openai-realtime-api-beta-main'

const setupStreaming = () => {
  // Configure WebSocket connection
  // Handle streaming responses
  // Manage conversation state
}
```

### 3. Tool Integration
```typescript
// Follow patterns from vendor/openai-agents-js-main/examples/tools/
const contentSearchTool = {
  name: 'content_search',
  description: 'Search Alan Hirsch\'s content library',
  parameters: {
    // Define tool schema
  },
  execute: async (params) => {
    // Implement search logic
  }
}
```

## Best Practices Checklist
