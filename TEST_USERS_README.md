- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom session management
- **Permissions**: Role-based access control throughout
- **Content**: Rich content types with interactive components
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS

## Security

- Test users are only created in development mode
- Service role key required for user management
- Session cookies are httpOnly and secure
- All endpoints validate environment and permissions

## Troubleshooting

### "Service role key not configured"
Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to your `.env.local` file.

### "Database connection failed"
Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct.

### "Test users already exist"
Users are created with upsert logic - existing users will be updated, not duplicated.

### Build errors
Run `npm run build` to check for TypeScript errors. Most CSS warnings are expected (Tailwind directives).
