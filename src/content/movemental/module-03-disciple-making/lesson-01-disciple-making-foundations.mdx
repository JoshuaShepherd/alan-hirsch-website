# Disciple-Making Foundations

> "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you."
> 
> **— Jesus (Matthew 28:19-20)**

## The Great Commission Mandate

Jesus' final command wasn't to make converts, members, or attenders—it was to make disciples. This distinction is crucial for understanding what movemental Christianity looks like.

### Understanding the Command

#### "Go" (πορευθέντες - poreuthentes)

- **Application**: Every believer is called to make disciples wherever they go

#### "Make Disciples" (μαθητεύσατε - matheteusate)
- **Meaning**: To cause someone to become a learner/follower
- **Process**: Not just conversion but transformation
- **Goal**: Reproducing followers who follow

#### "Teaching Them to Obey" (διδάσκοντες τηρεῖν - didaskontes terein)
- **Focus**: Obedience, not just knowledge
- **Method**: Modeling and mentoring, not just information transfer
- **Outcome**: Lifestyle transformation

## Disciple vs. Convert vs. Member

## Jesus' Disciple-Making Model

## The Multiplication Principle

### Addition vs. Multiplication

#### Addition Model
- **Method**: One person reaches many
- **Growth**: Linear (1, 2, 3, 4, 5...)
- **Dependency**: Success depends on key individual
- **Limitations**: Limited by one person's capacity
- **Sustainability**: Dies when key person leaves

#### Multiplication Model
- **Method**: Each person reaches and trains others
- **Growth**: Exponential (1, 2, 4, 8, 16...)
- **Distribution**: Success spread across many people
- **Potential**: Unlimited growth potential
- **Sustainability**: Continues beyond original catalyst

### The Power of Multiplication

If one person makes one disciple per year and each disciple does the same:
- **Year 1**: 2 disciples
- **Year 5**: 32 disciples
- **Year 10**: 1,024 disciples
- **Year 15**: 32,768 disciples
- **Year 20**: Over 1 million disciples

### Multiplication Obstacles

#### Individual Level
- **Fear**: Worried about inadequacy or failure
- **Pride**: Wanting to be the expert or hero
- **Control**: Difficulty releasing and trusting others
- **Perfectionism**: Waiting until "ready" to start

#### Community Level
- **Professionalization**: Belief that only trained clergy can disciple
- **Program Dependency**: Relying on classes instead of relationships
- **Attraction Model**: Focusing on bringing people in rather than sending out
- **Maintenance Mentality**: Preserving what exists rather than reproducing

## Building a Disciple-Making Culture

### Personal Prerequisites
- **Own Discipleship**: Can't give what you don't have
- **Available Time**: Discipleship requires significant investment
- **Heart for People**: Genuine love for others' growth
- **Mission Mindset**: Understanding the Great Commission mandate

### Community Prerequisites
- **Leadership Support**: Leaders model and encourage disciple-making

- **Resource Allocation**: Time and money invested in disciple-making
- **System Integration**: Disciple-making embedded in all activities

### Environmental Factors
- **Permission**: People encouraged to start discipling others
- **Training**: Simple tools and methods provided
- **Support**: Ongoing coaching and encouragement
- **Celebration**: Success stories shared and honored

## Practical Disciple-Making Methods

- **Mentoring**: Experienced disciple guiding newer one
- **Spiritual Direction**: Focus on spiritual growth and formation
- **Accountability**: Regular check-ins on growth areas
- **Skill Development**: Teaching specific ministry capabilities

### Small Groups
- **Micro-Groups**: 2-3 people for intensive discipleship

## Common Mistakes

### Information Over Transformation
- **Problem**: Teaching without life change
- **Solution**: Focus on obedience and application
- **Method**: Experiential learning and practice

### Program Over Relationship
- **Problem**: Relying on curriculum instead of connection
- **Solution**: Life-on-life investment in people
- **Method**: Doing life together, not just meeting

### Professional Over Personal
- **Problem**: Only "qualified" people can disciple
- **Solution**: Every disciple can and should make disciples
- **Method**: Simple, reproducible approaches

### Perfection Over Progress
- **Problem**: Waiting until "ready" to start discipling
- **Solution**: Begin where you are with what you have
- **Method**: Learning by doing, growing through practice

## Assessment Questions

### Personal Readiness
- Who discipled you? How were you discipled?
- What's your current relationship with Jesus like?
- Who are you currently discipling or could disciple?
- What fears or obstacles hold you back from discipling others?

### Community Assessment
- How does your community define success?
- What percentage of members are actively making disciples?
- How are new disciples identified and developed?
- What systems support disciple-making?

## Next Steps

### Individual Action
1. **Identify**: Who could you begin discipling?
2. **Invite**: Ask someone to enter discipling relationship
3. **Plan**: Develop simple approach for meeting regularly
4. **Begin**: Start with where they are, not where you think they should be

### Community Action
1. **Assess**: Evaluate current disciple-making effectiveness
2. **Train**: Equip people with simple disciple-making tools
3. **Support**: Create systems that facilitate disciple-making
4. **Celebrate**: Honor those who are reproducing disciples

## Conclusion

Disciple-making is not optional for followers of Jesus—it's the core of the Great Commission. Every authentic movement of God has been characterized by disciples who make disciples who make disciples.

The question isn't whether we'll make disciples, but what kind of disciples we'll make. Will they be consumers or contributors? Spectators or participants? Endpoints or multipliers?

The future of the church depends on recovering the multiplication principle that Jesus embedded in his final command. This begins with each of us taking responsibility for making disciples who make disciples.

**Key Takeaway**: Disciple-making is about reproducing followers of Jesus who follow Jesus and make other followers. It requires intentional, relational, reproducible methods focused on multiplication rather than addition.

**Coming Next**: We'll explore practical methods and tools for making disciples, including how to structure relationships, create learning experiences, and measure progress in discipleship.
