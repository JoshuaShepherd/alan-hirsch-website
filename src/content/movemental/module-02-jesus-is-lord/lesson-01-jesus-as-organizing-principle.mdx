# Jesus as Organizing Principle

> "Jesus is Lord" was the earliest Christian creed, and it meant far more than personal salvation—it was a declaration of ultimate allegiance that restructured everything.
> 
> **— Alan Hirsch**

## Beyond Personal Savior

While the evangelical church has rightly emphasized Jesus as personal Savior, we've often missed the fuller implications of his lordship. Jesus as organizing principle means he shapes not just our personal spirituality but every aspect of individual and community life.

### The Difference

| Jesus as Personal Savior | Jesus as Organizing Principle |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Forgives my sins | Governs my decisions |
| Guarantees my salvation | Guides my priorities |
| Meets my needs | Shapes my values |
| Helps me in trouble | Orders my relationships |
| Saves my soul | Transforms my culture |

## What "Organizing Principle" Means

An organizing principle is the central idea or value around which everything else arranges itself. It's the filter through which all decisions are made, the foundation upon which all structures are built, and the compass that guides all direction.

### Characteristics of Organizing Principles

- **Centrality**: Everything else is subordinate
- **Authority**: Final decision-making power
- **Integration**: Connects all aspects of life
- **Direction**: Provides clear guidance
- **Identity**: Defines who we are

### Jesus as THE Organizing Principle

When Jesus is the organizing principle:

#### For Individuals
- **Values**: Shaped by Jesus' teachings and example
- **Decisions**: Filtered through "What would Jesus do/want?"
- **Resources**: Allocated according to kingdom priorities
- **Relationships**: Conducted according to Jesus' relational model
- **Purpose**: Aligned with Jesus' mission

#### For Communities
- **Mission**: Focused on Jesus' Great Commission
- **Structure**: Designed to serve Jesus' purposes
- **Leadership**: Following Jesus' servant leadership model
- **Conflict Resolution**: Using Jesus' methods and values
- **Resource Allocation**: Reflecting Jesus' priorities

#### For Movements
- **Direction**: Guided by Jesus' vision of the kingdom
- **Methods**: Consistent with Jesus' approach to ministry
- **Success Metrics**: Defined by Jesus' values, not worldly measures
- **Expansion**: Through Jesus' model of incarnational presence
- **Sustainability**: Dependent on Jesus' ongoing presence and power

## Competing Organizing Principles

Every person and community has organizing principles, whether conscious or unconscious. The question isn't whether we have them, but which ones dominate.

### Common Competing Principles

#### Individual Level
- **Comfort**: "What makes me feel good?"
- **Success**: "What advances my career/status?"
- **Security**: "What keeps me safe?"
- **Pleasure**: "What do I enjoy?"
- **Family**: "What's best for my loved ones?"

#### Community Level
- **Survival**: "What keeps us going?"
- **Growth**: "What brings more people/money?"
- **Tradition**: "What have we always done?"
- **Respectability**: "What looks good to others?"
- **Efficiency**: "What works best?"

#### Cultural Level
- **Individualism**: "What serves personal freedom?"
- **Materialism**: "What increases wealth/possessions?"
- **Nationalism**: "What serves our country?"
- **Progress**: "What represents advancement?"
- **Tolerance**: "What avoids conflict?"

### The Problem with Competing Principles

When other principles compete with Jesus:
- **Divided Loyalty**: We serve multiple masters
- **Decision Paralysis**: Conflicting principles create confusion
- **Inconsistent Behavior**: Actions don't align with stated beliefs
- **Mission Drift**: We lose focus on Jesus' purposes
- **Cultural Captivity**: We're shaped more by culture than kingdom

## Jesus' Organizing Authority

### The Biblical Foundation

Scripture makes clear that Jesus' lordship extends beyond personal salvation:

#### Cosmic Authority
- "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18)
- "He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy" (Colossians 1:18)

#### Cultural Authority
- "Every knee should bow... and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord" (Philippians 2:10-11)
- "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah" (Revelation 11:15)

#### Practical Authority
- "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?" (Luke 6:46)
- "Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching" (John 14:23)

### Jesus' Own Example

Jesus demonstrated what it means to live with an organizing principle:

#### The Father's Will
- "My food is to do the will of him who sent me" (John 4:34)
- "I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me" (John 6:38)

#### Mission Focus
- "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent" (Luke 4:43)
- "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost" (Luke 19:10)

#### Value Integration
- Teaching, healing, serving, and suffering all flowed from the same source
- No separation between "spiritual" and "secular" activities
- Every action reflected kingdom values

## Overcoming Obstacles

### Challenge 1: "But That's Too Radical"

**The Response**: Start where you are but don't stay there
**Practical Steps**: 
- Begin with small decisions and work up
- Find others who share this commitment
- Study Jesus' teachings more deeply
- Ask for grace to grow in faithfulness

### Challenge 2: "People Won't Accept That"

**The Reality**: Not everyone will embrace Jesus' full lordship
**The Response**: Focus on those who are ready and willing
**Practical Steps**:
- Start with core group of committed disciples
- Demonstrate the benefits through your life
- Create space for people to grow gradually

### Challenge 3: "We Have Practical Constraints"

**The Reality**: Jesus understands our limitations
**The Response**: Seek creative solutions within constraints
**Practical Steps**:
- Ask "How can we honor Jesus within these limitations?"
- Look for small ways to align with kingdom values
- Plan for long-term alignment while working short-term
- Trust God to open doors as we're faithful

## Assessment Questions

### Personal Assessment
- In what areas of your life is Jesus clearly the organizing principle?
- Where do you notice other principles competing with Jesus?
- What decisions this week reflected Jesus' priorities?
- How do your relationships demonstrate Jesus' lordship?

### Community Assessment
- What organizing principles actually drive your community's decisions?
- How does your budget reflect Jesus' priorities?
- Do your programs serve Jesus' mission or other goals?
- How does your leadership model reflect Jesus' example?

## Practical Exercises

### Daily Practice
1. **Morning Commitment**: Begin each day by surrendering to Jesus' lordship
2. **Decision Filter**: Ask "What would Jesus want?" before major decisions
3. **Evening Review**: Reflect on how well you honored Jesus' lordship
4. **Scripture Meditation**: Study Jesus' teachings and example regularly

### Community Practice
1. **Mission Audit**: Evaluate all activities against Jesus' mission
2. **Budget Review**: Assess spending against kingdom priorities

4. **Decision Process**: Include Jesus-centered questions in decision making

## Case Study: Reorganizing Around Jesus

### The Situation
A successful church realized their organizing principle had shifted from Jesus to numerical growth. Programs were driven by attendance rather than discipleship, and decisions were made based on what would attract people rather than what would honor Jesus.

### The Process
1. **Recognition**: Leadership acknowledged the drift
2. **Repentance**: Community confessed and asked for realignment
3. **Realignment**: Restructured programs around Jesus' mission
4. **Results**: Slower numerical growth but deeper spiritual transformation

### The Outcome
- More authentic disciples
- Greater community impact
- Stronger sense of mission
- Increased spiritual vitality

## Reflection Questions

- What would change in your life if Jesus truly became your organizing principle?
- Which competing principles do you struggle with most?
- How might your community be different if Jesus were the clear organizing principle?
- What small step could you take this week toward greater Jesus-centeredness?

## Conclusion

Making Jesus the organizing principle isn't just about believing in him—it's about organizing every aspect of life around his person, teachings, and mission. This transforms not just our spirituality but our economics, politics, relationships, and daily decisions.

This is what the early Christians meant when they declared "Jesus is Lord"—not just that he was their personal Savior, but that he was the organizing principle of their entire existence. This declaration cost them everything and changed the world.

The question for us is the same: Will we allow Jesus to be the organizing principle of our lives and communities, or will we settle for him being just one influence among many?

**Key Takeaway**: Jesus as organizing principle means he shapes every aspect of life and community, not just our personal spirituality. This requires identifying and surrendering competing principles.

**Coming Next**: We'll explore what it means to live under Jesus' lordship in practical areas like money, relationships, time, and decision-making.
