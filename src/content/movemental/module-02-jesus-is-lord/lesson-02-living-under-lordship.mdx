# Living Under Lordship

> "If you love me, keep my commands... Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching."
> 
> **â€” Jesus (John 14:15, 23)**

## From Declaration to Daily Life

Declaring "Jesus is Lord" is one thing; living under his lordship is another. True lordship transforms how we handle money, relate to people, use time, make decisions, and respond to challenges. It's in these practical areas that lordship becomes real.

## Money and Resources: Kingdom Economics

### Jesus' Teaching on Money

Jesus spoke more about money than almost any other topic because how we handle resources reveals our true organizing principle.

#### Key Principles
- **God's Ownership**: "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it" (Psalm 24:1)
- **Stewardship**: We're managers, not owners
- **Kingdom Priority**: "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33)
- **Generous Heart**: "Give, and it will be given to you" (Luke 6:38)

### Practical Lordship with Money

#### Giving
- **First Fruits**: Giving comes first, not last
- **Percentage**: A regular portion recognizes God's ownership
- **Sacrificial**: Sometimes giving beyond comfort for kingdom purposes
- **Joyful**: Giving as worship, not obligation

#### Spending
- **Kingdom Filter**: Does this purchase align with Jesus' values?
- **Need vs. Want**: Distinguishing between necessities and desires
- **Justice Consideration**: How were these goods produced?
- **Witness Factor**: What does this spending communicate about my values?

#### Saving and Investing
- **Security vs. Trust**: Balancing provision with dependence on God
- **Ethical Investment**: Supporting companies that align with kingdom values
- **Emergency vs. Hoarding**: Reasonable preparation vs. excessive accumulation
- **Legacy Thinking**: What inheritance am I leaving?

### Common Money Challenges

#### "I Don't Have Enough to Give"
- **Start Small**: Give something, even if modest
- **Trust Process**: God honors faithfulness with little
- **Redefine Enough**: What do you actually need?
- **Find Ways**: Look for opportunities to give time or service

#### "I Worked Hard for This Money"
- **Recognition**: God gave the ability and opportunity to work
- **Partnership**: Working with God, not for God
- **Purpose**: Money as tool for kingdom purposes
- **Blessing**: God blesses us to be a blessing

#### Key Characteristics
