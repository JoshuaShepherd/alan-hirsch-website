# mDNA: The Six Elements

> "These are the irreducible minimums of what it means to be an apostolic movement. Remove any one of these and you limit the capacity for movement."

## Understanding Movemental DNA

Just as biological DNA contains the genetic information necessary for life, movemental DNA (mDNA) contains the essential elements required for apostolic movements. These six elements don't just coexist‚Äîthey interact synergistically to create something far greater than the sum of their parts.

### The Power of Synergy

When all six elements are present and healthy, they create a feedback loop that accelerates movement:

- Each element strengthens the others
- Missing elements create bottlenecks
- Weak elements limit overall capacity
- Healthy interaction produces exponential growth

## The Six Elements of mDNA

### 1. Jesus is Lord üëë

**Definition**: The total allegiance to Jesus as the organizing principle of individual and corporate life.

#### More Than Personal Savior
While Jesus as personal Savior addresses individual sin and salvation, Jesus as Lord addresses:
- **Cosmic Authority**: Christ's rule over all creation
- **Cultural Transformation**: Jesus' values reshaping society
- **Organizational Principle**: Christ-centered decision making
- **Mission Direction**: Following Jesus' example and commands

#### Practical Implications
- **Values Alignment**: Community decisions reflect Jesus' priorities
- **Resource Allocation**: Money and time invested in kingdom purposes
- **Lifestyle Integration**: No separation between sacred and secular
- **Authority Structure**: Scripture and Spirit guide rather than human tradition

#### Signs of Health
- Decisions consistently reflect Jesus' teachings
- Resources sacrificially deployed for mission
- Community life demonstrates kingdom values
- Members growing in Christlikeness

#### Signs of Dysfunction
- Cultural values trump biblical values
- Personal comfort prioritized over mission
- Leadership based on worldly rather than kingdom principles
- Compartmentalized spirituality

### 2. Disciple Making üë•

**Definition**: Reproducing followers of Jesus who follow Jesus and make other followers.

#### Beyond Conversion
True disciple making involves:
- **Transformation**: Internal change, not just external compliance
- **Reproduction**: Disciples who make disciples
- **Multiplication**: Exponential rather than additive growth
- **Maturation**: Growing disciples, not just recruiting members

#### The Multiplication Imperative
- Every disciple should make disciples
- Simple, reproducible processes
- Focus on transformation over information
- Measure by reproduction, not just retention

#### Essential Elements
- **Life-on-Life**: Relationship-based development
- **Intentionality**: Purposeful rather than accidental
- **Simplicity**: Methods everyone can use
- **Accountability**: Mutual responsibility and support

#### Signs of Health
- Regular emergence of new disciples
- Existing disciples actively making disciples
- Simple, transferable methods in use
- Growth in character, not just knowledge

#### Signs of Dysfunction
- Programs without relationships
- Information transfer without transformation
- Dependence on professionals for spiritual functions
- Converts who don't become disciples

### 3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse üåç

**Definition**: The sent nature of God's people living incarnationally among those they're called to reach.

#### Missional vs. Attractional
- **Missional**: Sent to others in their context
- **Attractional**: Expecting others to come to us

#### Incarnational Living
Following Jesus' example of incarnation:
- **Presence**: Living among those we're called to reach
- **Proximity**: Physical and relational closeness
- **Powerlessness**: Serving rather than controlling
- **Proclamation**: Word and deed integration

#### Cultural Intelligence
- **Understanding Context**: Learning the language, customs, values
- **Appropriate Adaptation**: Changing methods while maintaining message
- **Indigenous Leadership**: Raising up local leaders
- **Relevant Communication**: Translating gospel into cultural terms

#### Signs of Health
- Members actively engaged in their contexts
- Church planting in new cultural settings
- Gospel communication relevant to hearers
- New believers from community, not just transfers

#### Signs of Dysfunction
- Fortress mentality ("come to us")
- Cultural isolation or irrelevance
- Dependence on professional missionaries
- Growth primarily through transfer

### 4. Apostolic Environment üöÄ

**Definition**: APEST leadership creating a pioneering, entrepreneurial environment that embraces risk for kingdom advancement.

#### The Five-Fold Ministry (APEST)
- **Apostles**: Pioneering, church planting, movement building
- **Prophets**: Calling to righteousness, cultural critique, vision casting
- **Evangelists**: Gospel proclamation, cultural translation, harvest focus
- **Shepherds**: Care, protection, community building, discipleship
- **Teachers**: Truth preservation, doctrine, systematic learning

#### Apostolic Leadership Characteristics
- **Pioneering Spirit**: Comfortable with uncertainty and risk
- **Entrepreneurial Edge**: Creating new things for kingdom purposes
- **Network Thinking**: Building connections rather than just institutions
- **Multiplication Focus**: Always thinking about expansion and reproduction
- **Cultural Engagement**: Taking gospel to new contexts

#### Creating Apostolic Environment
- **Risk Tolerance**: Encouraging experimentation and innovation
- **Leadership Development**: Raising leaders rather than hiring them
- **Permission Giving**: Empowering rather than controlling
- **Learning Culture**: Embracing failure as education
- **Vision Casting**: Keeping the bigger picture alive

#### Signs of Health
- Regular launching of new initiatives
- Leaders emerging from the community
- High tolerance for risk and failure
- Innovation in ministry approaches
- Network connections with other movements

#### Signs of Dysfunction
- Risk aversion and control orientation
- Dependence on external leaders
- Maintenance focus over mission focus
- Resistance to change and innovation
- Isolation from other kingdom work

### 5. Organic Systems üå±

**Definition**: Simple, reproducible, and scalable structures that facilitate rather than hinder movement.

#### Form Follows Function
- **Purpose-Driven**: Structure serves mission, not vice versa
- **Simplicity**: Everyone can understand and reproduce
- **Scalability**: Works at different sizes and contexts
- **Adaptability**: Can change as needs change

#### Characteristics of Organic Systems
- **Flat Hierarchy**: Minimal layers of leadership
- **Network Structure**: Connected but not controlled
- **Reproducible**: Easy to start and maintain
- **Local Ownership**: Communities govern themselves
- **Low Maintenance**: Doesn't require extensive administration

#### Examples of Organic Systems
- **House Churches**: Simple, reproducible, multiplying
- **Training Networks**: Peer-to-peer learning systems
- **Mission Teams**: Task-focused, temporary structures
- **Mentoring Relationships**: One-on-one development

#### Signs of Health
- Easy startup of new communities/initiatives
- Minimal bureaucracy and administration
- Local ownership and decision-making
- Rapid reproduction and multiplication
- Adaptive capacity for different contexts

#### Signs of Dysfunction
- Complex structures requiring specialists
- Heavy bureaucracy and administration
- Central control and micromanagement
- Slow or impossible reproduction
- Rigid systems resistant to change

### 6. Communitas ü§ù

**Definition**: Authentic community forged through shared mission and common struggle.

#### Beyond Social Community
Communitas differs from mere social gathering:
- **Mission-Forged**: Unity created through shared purpose
- **Adversity-Tested**: Bonds strengthened through common struggle  
- **Sacrificial**: Members give up personal comfort for common good
- **Transformative**: Relationships that change people

#### Elements of Communitas
- **Common Mission**: Shared sense of calling and purpose
- **Mutual Sacrifice**: Giving up for each other and the mission
- **Authentic Relationships**: Real vulnerability and transparency
- **Collective Identity**: "We" identity stronger than "I" identity

#### Creating Communitas
- **Shared Challenge**: Tackling difficult mission together
- **Common Risk**: Facing uncertainty and sacrifice together
- **Regular Rhythms**: Consistent gathering and interaction
- **Story Integration**: Shared narrative of God's work among them

#### Signs of Health
- Deep relationships forged through mission
- Sacrificial care for one another
- Strong group identity and loyalty
- Joy and celebration even in difficulty
- Authentic transparency and vulnerability

#### Signs of Dysfunction
- Superficial relationships
- Self-focused rather than mission-focused
- Conflict avoidance or unhealthy conflict
- Individualistic rather than communal mindset
- Social activity without spiritual depth

## How the Elements Work Together

### Synergistic Interaction

The six elements don't just coexist‚Äîthey enhance each other:

- **Jesus is Lord** provides the organizing principle for all other elements
- **Disciple Making** ensures the movement reproduces and grows
- **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** keeps the movement outwardly focused
- **Apostolic Environment** provides leadership and pioneering spirit
- **Organic Systems** enable rapid reproduction and multiplication
- **Communitas** creates the relational bonds that sustain the movement

### The Multiplication Effect

When all elements are healthy:
- Each element amplifies the others
- Growth becomes exponential rather than linear
- The movement becomes self-sustaining
- Cultural transformation becomes possible

### The Bottleneck Effect

When any element is missing or weak:
- It limits the effectiveness of all other elements
- Growth becomes constrained or stops
- The movement loses momentum
- Institutional drift becomes likely

## Assessment Tool

Rate your community/movement on each element (1-10):

### Jesus is Lord
- Are decisions consistently made based on Jesus' teachings and example?
- Do resources reflect kingdom priorities?
- Is there integration of faith and life?

### Disciple Making
- Are new disciples being made regularly?
- Do disciples actively make other disciples?
- Is transformation happening, not just information transfer?

### Missional-Incarnational Impulse
- Are members actively engaged in their communities?
- Is the gospel being translated into relevant terms?
- Are new communities/churches being planted?

### Apostolic Environment
- Are leaders emerging from within the community?
- Is there tolerance for risk and innovation?
- Are new initiatives being launched regularly?

### Organic Systems
- Are structures simple and reproducible?
- Can new communities start easily?
- Is there local ownership and decision-making?

### Communitas
- Are relationships deep and authentic?
- Is there shared sacrifice for common mission?
- Do people have strong community identity?

## Development Strategies

### For Weak Elements

If an element scores low (1-4):
1. **Study**: Research that element thoroughly
2. **Pray**: Ask God to develop it in your community
3. **Experiment**: Try small steps to strengthen it
4. **Learn**: Connect with communities strong in that area
5. **Be Patient**: Authentic development takes time

### For Missing Elements

If an element is completely absent:
1. **Start Small**: Don't try to change everything at once
2. **Find Champions**: Identify people passionate about that element
3. **Create Space**: Make room for the element to develop
4. **Remove Barriers**: Eliminate what prevents its emergence
5. **Celebrate Progress**: Acknowledge small wins along the way

## Reflection Questions

- Which of the six elements feels strongest in your context? Why?
- Which element is most lacking? What might be causing this?
- How do you see the elements interacting (or failing to interact) in your community?
- What would need to change for all six elements to be healthy?
- Which element do you feel most personally called to develop?

## Conclusion

The six elements of mDNA aren't a program to implement but a DNA to cultivate. They represent the irreducible minimums of apostolic movement‚Äîremove any one and you limit the movement's capacity.

The goal isn't perfection in all areas immediately, but growth toward health in each element. As communities develop stronger mDNA, they become more movemental, more transformative, and more aligned with God's mission in the world.

Remember: these elements are meant to work together. Focus on developing all six, understanding that weakness in one area will limit the effectiveness of the others.

**Key Takeaway**: The six elements of mDNA work synergistically to create apostolic movements. All six must be present and healthy for maximum movement capacity.

**Coming Next**: We'll explore how to shift from institutional to movemental thinking, examining the paradigm changes necessary for transformation.
