# The Great Forgetting: Why Movements Die

> "When we recover apostolic genius, we recover the full church. The full church has the capacity to be the full church that God intends it to be." 
> 
> **— Alan Hirsch, The Forgotten Ways**

## Introduction: A Tale of Two Churches

The church began as a revolutionary movement that transformed the known world in just three centuries. Yet somewhere along the way, this dynamic, organic movement became institutionalized, domesticated, and largely ineffective at fulfilling its original mission.

This transformation represents what Alan Hirsch calls "The Great Forgetting" — the loss of the church's apostolic genius that once made it the most potent transformative force in human history.

## The Original Movement

### Characteristics of the Early Church Movement

The early church exhibited remarkable characteristics that enabled unprecedented growth and impact:

- **Exponential Growth**: From 120 disciples to 6 million believers in 300 years
- **Geographic Expansion**: Spread across three continents without modern communication
- **Cultural Transformation**: Changed the moral fabric of entire societies
- **Persecution Resilience**: Thrived under intense opposition
- **Organic Leadership**: Leaders emerged naturally from communities

### The Power of Apostolic Genius

What made this possible? Hirsch identifies six essential elements (mDNA) that formed the genetic code of apostolic movements:

1. **Jesus is Lord** - Ultimate allegiance and organizing principle
2. **Disciple Making** - Reproducing followers who follow
3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** - Sent people living incarnationally
4. **Apostolic Environment** - APEST leadership and pioneering spirit
5. **Organic Systems** - Simple, reproducible structures
6. **Communitas** - Shared mission creating authentic community

## The Great Forgetting

### The Constantinian Shift

Everything changed when Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity in 313 AD. What seemed like a victory became the beginning of the great forgetting:

- **From Movement to Institution**: Dynamic networks became static hierarchies
- **From Mission to Maintenance**: Energy shifted from expansion to preservation
- **From Every Member Ministry to Clergy-Laity Division**: Professionalization of faith
- **From Simple to Complex**: Elaborate systems replaced organic simplicity

### What We Lost

In gaining respectability and security, the church lost its revolutionary edge:

#### 1. **Missional Identity**
- **Before**: Every believer was a missionary
- **After**: Mission became a specialized department

#### 2. **Organic Leadership**
- **Before**: Leaders emerged from communities based on calling and gifting
- **After**: Professional clergy controlled spiritual functions

#### 3. **Adaptive Capacity**
- **Before**: Flexible, responsive to context
- **After**: Rigid structures resistant to change

#### 4. **Multiplication Mindset**
- **Before**: Natural reproduction and planting
- **After**: Attractional models focused on gathering

## Contemporary Implications

### Modern Institutional Patterns

Today's church often exhibits patterns that limit movement potential:

- **Edifice Complex**: Buildings become identity rather than tools
- **Programmatic Thinking**: Activities replace relationships
- **Consumer Mentality**: Members expect services rather than participation
- **Attractional Model**: "Come to us" rather than "go to them"
- **Professionalization**: Dependence on trained clergy for spiritual functions

### The Cost of Forgetting

This institutional drift has significant consequences:

- **Declining Influence**: Church losing cultural relevance
- **Membership Decline**: People leaving institutional forms
- **Mission Stagnation**: Growth primarily through transfer, not conversion
- **Leadership Crisis**: Shortage of passionate, equipped leaders
- **Cultural Disconnect**: Church language and methods becoming irrelevant

## The Path Forward

### Remembering Our DNA

The solution isn't to abandon structure but to recover our apostolic DNA:

1. **Recognize the Pattern**: Acknowledge how institutional thinking limits us
2. **Recover the Elements**: Rediscover the six mDNA components
3. **Realign Practices**: Let apostolic genius reshape our methods
4. **Release the Movement**: Trust God's people to be the church

### Questions for Personal Reflection

- How has institutional thinking shaped your understanding of church?
- What would change if every member saw themselves as a missionary?
- Where do you see signs of apostolic genius in your context?
- What institutional patterns might be limiting movement in your community?

## Practical Application

### Assessment Exercise

Rate your church/community on these movement characteristics (1-10):

- **Missional Focus**: Are we sending or just gathering?
- **Leadership Development**: Are we raising leaders or hiring professionals?
- **Multiplication**: Are we planting new communities?
- **Cultural Engagement**: Are we incarnating in our context?
- **Simple Systems**: Are our structures helping or hindering?

### Next Steps

1. **Study Church History**: Research periods of great movement
2. **Identify Patterns**: Look for institutional vs. movement thinking in your context
3. **Begin Conversations**: Discuss these concepts with others
4. **Start Small**: Look for ways to live more movemental

## Conclusion

The great forgetting doesn't have to be permanent. Throughout history, God has raised up movements that recovered apostolic genius and transformed their world. The question is: Will we be part of the great remembering?

The church that conquered the Roman Empire lives within us. The same Spirit that empowered the apostles fills us today. The genetic code for movement lies dormant in every Christian community, waiting to be awakened.

**Key Takeaway**: The church's greatest need isn't new strategies but recovered DNA — the apostolic genius that made the early church the most transformative force in human history.

**Coming Next**: We'll explore what it means to make "Jesus is Lord" not just a confession but the organizing principle of movement life.
