# Sent People Living Incarnationally

> "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."
> 
> **— Jesus (John 20:21)**

## The Missional-Incarnational Foundation

The third element of movemental DNA combines two crucial concepts: being **sent** (missional) and being **present** (incarnational). Together, they form the impulse that drives authentic movements toward those who need to encounter Jesus.

### Understanding "Missional"

**Missional** means recognizing that we are sent people—not merely invited people who invite others.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Sent Identity**: We are missionaries wherever we are
- **Outward Focus**: Primary attention on those outside the faith community
- **Contextual Engagement**: Understanding and entering others' worlds
- **Cultural Translation**: Making the gospel accessible to different contexts

### Understanding "Incarnational"

**Incarnational** means following Jesus' example of taking on flesh and dwelling among those we're called to reach.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Presence**: Living among people rather than staying separate
- **Proximity**: Physical and relational closeness
- **Identification**: Understanding and empathizing with others' experiences
- **Service**: Meeting needs without expecting anything in return

## Jesus' Incarnational Model

### The Divine Pattern

The incarnation of Jesus provides the ultimate model for missional-incarnational living:

#### He Left Heaven
- **Sacrifice**: Gave up divine prerogatives
- **Humility**: Took on human limitations
- **Risk**: Entered a world that would reject him
- **Love**: Motivated by desire to save humanity

#### He Entered Our World
- **Cultural Immersion**: Became fully human in specific context
- **Language Learning**: Spoke in ways people could understand
- **Relationship Building**: Formed genuine friendships
- **Needs Meeting**: Addressed physical, emotional, and spiritual needs

#### He Lived Among Us
- **Daily Presence**: Shared ordinary life experiences
- **Vulnerability**: Experienced hunger, thirst, exhaustion, emotion
- **Accessibility**: Available to all kinds of people
- **Authenticity**: Consistent in private and public

#### He Served Sacrificially
- **Others-Focused**: Put others' needs before his own comfort
- **Holistic Ministry**: Addressed whole person, not just spiritual needs
- **Costly Love**: Service that required personal sacrifice
- **Transformative Impact**: Presence that changed people and communities

### Jesus' Incarnational Practices

## Attractional vs. Incarnational Approaches

### The Incarnational Model

#### Characteristics:
- **"Go to Them"**: Moving into others' contexts and communities
- **Presence-Centered**: Focus on being with people in their daily lives
- **Relational Authenticity**: Real relationships in real-life settings
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Ministry that fits the receiving context

#### Strengths:

## Conclusion

The missional-incarnational impulse is not about adding another program to church life—it's about fundamentally reorienting our lives around being sent people who live incarnationally among those we're called to reach.

This requires:
- **Identity Shift**: From invited people to sent people
- **Location Shift**: From church building to community presence
- **Relationship Shift**: From superficial contact to incarnational friendship
- **Service Shift**: From self-focused to others-focused ministry

When this impulse is strong in individuals and communities, the gospel naturally spreads into new contexts and cultures, creating the kind of expansion that characterizes authentic movements.
