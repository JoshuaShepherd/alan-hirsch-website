## Introduction

In many declining denominational systems, those who attempt to implement authentic apostolic influence are often “frozen out” or exiled because they disturb the equilibrium of a system in stasis. This loss of apostolic influence is one of the key factors in mainstream denominational decline. If we truly desire missional churches, we must cultivate a missional leadership system to drive them—it’s that simple.

## Challenges in Apostolic Ministry

Two significant challenges confront the Western church as it seeks to embrace apostolic ministry:

1. **Confusion About Apostolic Roles:**  
   Many confuse the unique role and calling of the original apostles with present-day apostolic ministry. Contemporary apostolic ministry is a gifting that continues the original work of the New Testament apostles, especially the Twelve. However, it does not alter the original apostolic mandate.
   
2. **Abuse of Apostolic Gifting:**  
   Today, many who claim apostolic gifts discredit the role through abuse of authority. The true apostolic leadership dynamic is that of a servant-inspirer, not a ruler who “lords it over others.” Authentic apostolic ministry draws its authority from service, calling, and moral and spiritual influence, not positional power. It is characterized by suffering and empowerment, not organizational governance.

## Functions of Apostolic Leadership

The apostolic leader is the custodian of the church's DNA—the gospel. Practically, this role can be broken down into three core functions:

### 1. Embed mDNA by Pioneering New Ground
- Continually initiates new missional efforts and plants churches, often in cross-cultural contexts.
- Implants and preserves all aspects of missional DNA (mDNA) in each new community.

### 2. Guard mDNA through Theological Integration
- Ensures each church remains true to the gospel and retains a missional ethos.
- Fosters a “web of meaning” within the movement via story-sharing, ethos development, corrective teaching, and leader cultivation.
- Protects churches from deviating from their intended identity.

### 3. Create Environments for Other Ministries to Emerge
- The apostolic gift is foundational for releasing and nurturing the other equipping ministries (prophetic, evangelistic, pastoral, and teaching) listed in Ephesians 4—collectively known as APEST.
- Establishes the relational fabric necessary for authentic movement dynamics, acting as a “cultural architect.”

## The APEST Ministries: Roles and Dynamics

Ephesians 4 outlines five key ministries:

- **Apostolic:** Steward of the gospel, church DNA, and extension of Christianity; prone to autocratic tendencies if unchecked.
- **Prophetic:** Attuned to God’s will; challenges the status quo; can become one-dimensional or passive if isolated.
- **Evangelistic:** Communicator of the gospel, recruiter to the cause; may lose sight of the church's larger purpose if monopolized.
- **Pastoral:** Shepherds, nurtures, and disciples; maintains loving community but risks creating co-dependency or passive spirituality.
- **Teaching:** Clarifies God’s mind; guides in wisdom; can devolve into dogmatism or intellectualism if dominant.

All believers can embody these ministries, not just leaders. A functional church system allows these gifts to operate synergistically.

## Cultivating Apostolic and Missional Environments

To nurture apostolic ministry, consider these primary habits and related practices:

### **Habit 1: Pioneer and Multiply**

- **Initiate New Missionary Incentives and Communities:**  
  Regularly launch new missional initiatives, aiming for a culture of multiplication.

- **Prepare New Missionary Teams:**  
  Identify and develop new teams. The apostolic role empowers and stimulates team formation rather than controls it.

- **Embrace Bold Experimentation:**  
  Encourage risk-taking in pioneering mission efforts. Establish a culture that permits failure and celebrates learning.

- **Embed a Multiplication Ethos:**  
  Instill a church-wide commitment to multiplication from the outset. Encourage mantras like, “Every person a church planter, every church a church-planting church.”

- **Provide a Framework for Dreaming and Planning:**  
  Equip the community with shared language and processes for planning new ventures.

---

### **Habit 2: Cultivate Apostolic Genius**

- **Develop an Understanding of Apostolic Genius:**  
  Engage with resources that stretch the imagination about church and movement dynamics.

- **Missional Practices:**  
  Form common practices that express the group's unique identity and values. Move mission from a program to a lifestyle.

- **Engage in Theological Reflection:**  
  Explore scripture as a living text. Participate in group study, attend conferences, and invite practitioners to share missional theology.

- **Retell Stories:**  
  Regularly share and document ministry stories to inspire, communicate calling, and remember God’s faithfulness.

- **Establish Action–Reflection Loops:**  
  Alternate action with collective reflection and prayer to continually realign with the group’s mission.

- **Preserve Mission as Organizing Principle:**  
  Guard against inward drift by keeping missional purpose central to all decision-making and practice.

- **Commit to Regular, Mission-Focused Prayer:**  
  Incorporate prayer for mission as a core group discipline.

---

### **Habit 3: Foster Community Calling and Uniqueness**

- **Discover Group Uniqueness:**  
  Undertake a collaborative, prayerful discernment process to unearth the community’s distinctive gifting.

  **Discernment Questions:**
  - Why did God bring this group into being?
  - What are the group’s founding passions?
  - How has God worked through the group in the past?
  - What is the one thing this group does really well?
  - What unique contribution does this group make to God’s broader mission?

- **Example (UNOH):**  
  Urban Neighbors of Hope spent a year collaboratively rediscovering their founding uniqueness, affirming their calling to seek God’s reign among the lost and poor, and incarnationally serve urban neighborhoods.

---

### **Habit 4: Develop Ministry Capacity**

- **Organize Community Around APEST Functions:**  
  Use APEST profiling to map ministry gifts and encourage complementary leadership development.

- **Training and Action–Reflection:**  
  Develop training pathways, action-reflection processes, and immersive experiences to grow both theory and practice.

- **Empowerment:**  
  Eschew command-and-control leadership in favor of empowering people to act on their passions and gifts.

---

### **Habit 5: Catalyze**

- **Catalytic Leadership:**  
  Apostolic influence also acts catalytically, connecting people, vision, and resources, and inspiring synergistic action.

  **Catalytic Practices:**
  - Initiate vision and ideas, then step back so others can take ownership.
  - Facilitate connections among members, matching passions to opportunities and resources.

  A catalyst is to a movement what iron is to an ammonia reaction—it enables but doesn’t become the product.

## Reflection and Group Process

To deepen understanding and practice, use these group reflection tools:

1. **Session 1: Explore**
   - What key idea stands out from this section?
   - In your own words, describe "apostolic environment."
   - Which habits or practices will you integrate?

2. **Session 2: Evaluate**
   - Is apostolic environment a strength or weakness in your group?
   - When was your community best at this?
   - What challenges or barriers are present?

3. **Session 3: Employ**
   - What steps will you take over the next twelve months?
   - What resources are needed? Who should be involved?
   - What will be your indicators of growth?

4. **Session 4: Personal Journal**
   - Prayerfully discern what God is saying to you and your group.
   - Record insights, impressions, and prayers.
   - Consider sharing reflections with the group and praying together.

## Moving Forward: Structuring for Organic, Movement-Oriented Growth

### **The Church as a Living System**

Scripture presents the church with organic imagery: body, field, seeds, tree, vine, yeast. These are more than metaphors—they reveal kingdom operational principles.

- **Living Systems Approach:**  
  Church life structures should mirror the adaptive, organizing principles of living systems—enabling high organization and adaptability.

- **Movement Ethos vs. Institutionalization:**  
  As institutions mature, they become increasingly set in their ways. Maintaining a movement ethos protects against institutional stagnation. Structure should serve life, be simple, and remain easily reproducible.

- **Networked Structure:**  
  Peter Ward’s concept of “liquid church” imagines a decentralized, relationally driven network of communities, as opposed to “solid,” institutional churches.

- **Viral Reproduction:**  
  Faith spreads like a virus—through relational “sneezing,” not programmatic cloning. Multiplication must be simple and reproducible, not encumbered by resource-heavy systems.

---

## Habits for Organic Systems and Movement

To shape organic, movement-oriented environments, practice these four habits:

1. **Stir Up Movement**
    - Change how you think and talk about church—as a movement.
    - Expose the group to stories and models of vibrant movements.
    - Promote movement behaviors: fluid organization, permission to innovate, and a covenant to multiply.

2. **Structure Organically**
    - Distribute power and function to promote shared ownership and responsibility.
    - Become a learning organization where everyone contributes to and disseminates knowledge.
    - Structure around people’s energy, passion, and real-life rhythms—adapt structure to fit people, not vice versa.

3. **Network and Communicate Extensively**
    - Relational networks are held together by shared belief and purpose. Give priority to cultivating meaningful relationships and clear communication.

4. **Sneeze the Gospel**
    - Foster embedded, reproducible practices that enable the spontaneous expansion of faith throughout relational networks.

### **Key Takeaway**
Achieving missional church life requires intentional leadership structures that nurture the apostolic function, flatten organizational hierarchy, embed a movement ethos, and release every believer’s gifting into practical, multiplying mission.
