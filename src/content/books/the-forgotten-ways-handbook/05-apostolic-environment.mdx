---# Building Community, Mission, and Communitas

> "All organizations are merely conceptual embodiments of a very old, very basic idea—the idea of community. They can be no more or less than the sum of the beliefs of the people drawn to them; of their character, judgments, acts, and efforts. An organization's success has enormously more to do with clarity of a shared purpose, common principles and strength of belief in them than to assets, expertise, operating ability, or management competence, important as they may be."
>
> — Dee Hock

A community shaped by a sense of common belief and purpose is more valuable than any number of assets or skills. The key is to nurture comradeship around a united belief and sense of purpose in Jesus. This becomes the foundation on which to structure everything else.

## Forming Common Values, Beliefs, and Practices

- Invest significant time in forming a set of shared values, beliefs, and practices, as suggested in various elements of mDNA.
- Help new people become familiar with the group’s values, beliefs, and particular calling.
- Host weekend retreats to share the story of how and why the ministry began.
- Use varied means—dialogue, story, photos, video—to communicate identity and vision.
- Use these environments to dream and imagine the future together.
- Distill identity, purpose, and way of life into simple, memorable language.
- Identify your unique calling and establish simple missional practices.

**Case: TPC’s Practices**
- TPC initially developed twelve detailed practices but found them too complex and hard to recall.
- Later, they distilled these into a simple list of three practices, phrased as one question. This simplicity made all the difference for people beginning to live them.

### Honoring and Encouraging One Another

- Regularly honor and encourage one another.
- Host meals with a focus on what you appreciate in others:
    - Share what excites you about them
    - Identify godly traits at work
    - Discuss gifts and lessons learned from each other
- Use these moments to confirm the value God has placed in each person.
- Consistently affirming one another will promote shared belief and purpose.

## Evaluating Structures and Processes

### Exercise: Evaluate All Structures

- Evaluate each structure and process for strengths and weaknesses.
- On a scale of 1–10, do they support or inhibit community, ministry, and mission?
    - 1 = strongly inhibit, 10 = strongly support
    - Be ruthless with anything rated below 5.
- Consider:
    - Which structures can be reworked? How?
    - Which structures need replacing?
    - Suggestions for new structures?
    - Should you wipe the slate clean? If so, proceed at the community’s pace and collaborate at all levels.

## TPC: Structuring Organically — An Example

**Third Place Communities structures their community as follows:**

- **Households:**  
  The basic gathering unit, typically meeting anywhere (homes, parks, cafés). Households meet three times per month, expressing the values and purposes of TPC in unique ways (usually no more than 20 people).

- **Tribe:**  
  The collection of all TPC households, gathering formally once per month. The Tribe also connects informally through projects, shared spaces, and life rhythms.

- **Clan:**  
  TPC connects to a broader network of missional communities around the country (the Clan), via events, visits, and digital communication.

> The sun symbolizes core mission and DNA; circles are households; arrows signify multi-channel networking among churches. The Household, Tribe, and Clan structure is simple to run and easy to reproduce.

# Habit 3: Network and Communicate Extensively

Networking and communication are crucial for organic systems to thrive. A network involves independent people and groups who act autonomously but collaborate across boundaries towards a common purpose. Leadership in this context focuses on developing a relationally networked system rather than a rigid institution.

## Practice One: Develop Kingdom Synergy

Missional churches form meaningful connections beyond their own local body, recognizing that collaboration yields greater outcomes.

Ways to foster synergy:

- Locate, honor, and learn from other missional practitioners or communities.
- Collaborate rather than duplicate: train together, share resources, co-host events, and create in-depth internship-style programs.
- Host regular network days and workshops; develop shared resource banks.
- Organize retreats with other missional groups to forge deep bonds.

**At the heart:**  
"Have communion together often. Jesus is in our midst, uniting us."

## Practice Two: Ensure the Flow of Information

A healthy network maintains a free flow of information. Leaders empower by sharing information, not withholding it. Key tools and habits include:

- Church newsletters and calendars: Take pride and care in these communications.
- Allocate time during gatherings for communal sharing.
- Share articles, resources, and book suggestions regularly via email or online platforms.
- Provide and maintain a contact database with email lists.
- Use internet groups and social networks (e.g., Facebook, Shapevine) to simplify communication.

> “The greatest delight from all my days leading Visa, were open staff meetings... Every decision of the board was fully disclosed. Every employee was free to ask any question... Their questions were answered fully. ‘That’s confidential’ was not considered an answer.”
>
> — Dee Hock, Founder of VISA

## Practice Three: Collaborate and Dream Together

Encourage idea generation by involving the whole church community.

- Extend brainstorming to the crowd, not just a small team.
- Encourage dreams, ideas, and ownership from all.
- Leadership's function is to set the context for collaboration and interpret results.

Questions to stir missionary imagination:

- What is God preparing us for?
- How can we help expand God’s mission?
- How can we multiply our communities?
- What does our host community look like with God at its core?
- Where is God already at work—and how can we join in?
- What is “good news” for those we serve?

**Google’s Example:**  
Employees post ideas on an intranet, vote on favorites, and receive time/resources to develop winning ideas. Churches can adopt similar practices for mission.

**Exercises for Dreaming Together:**

1. Each person draws or writes three images/phrases representing their dream for mission in three years.
2. Share in pairs; select two from each pair to present.
3. Cluster dreams thematically on a board, title each cluster.
4. Join a cluster, then brainstorm actionable steps in small groups.

## Practice Four: Always Seek a Win-Win Outcome

Healthy networks intentionally pursue mutually beneficial alliances.

- Win-win is built on character, relationship, respect, and appreciation.
- Stephen Covey’s *Seven Habits of Highly Effective People*, especially the three social habits, are recommended.
- Forget self-promotion; focus on helping others succeed in mission.
- Reject win-lose, lose-win, and zero-sum thinking.

Steps towards win-win:

- See the issue from others' perspectives.
- Seek first to understand, then to be understood.
- Identify key challenges and desired results.
- Explore new, collaborative options.

# Habit 4: Sneeze the Gospel

Organic systems are innately capable of spontaneous, exponential reproduction. "Sneezing the gospel" refers to creating an environment where both gospel and community multiply naturally and rapidly.

The early church exemplifies this: from twenty-five thousand to twenty million believers in two centuries—growing virally due to the right conditions: common language, culture, infrastructure, and deep spiritual hunger.

## Practice One: Aim for Simplexity

Simplexity merges simplicity and complexity—the ability to distill a message to its core without losing depth.

- "Jesus is Lord" captures the complex in three profound words.
- Both the message and the community must be easily transferable.
- "Simple to get, simple to spread."
- Distill the gospel to its irreducible minimum and real-life relevance.
- Develop simple, reproducible church expressions; keep each core unit small and uncluttered.

## Practice Two: Release Early and Often

Borrowed from software development, this principle advocates for launching innovations before perfection and learning through real-world feedback.

- Encourage experimentation; don’t wait for the perfect plan.
- Develop a culture of feedback and learning from mistakes.
- Regularly research new mission areas and involve as many members as possible.
- Consistently equip and value mission groups as heroes.
- Build new expressions of church around new believers, keeping things simple and focused on missionary skills.
- Build mission initiatives around people’s passions, gifts, and lifestyles.

## Practice Three: Aim for Viruslike Growth

For organic growth, the church's reproductive system must emulate the viral spread of ideas: simple to catch, simple to pass on.

- Be persistent, but not pushy—seek critical mass.
- Choose initial host communities carefully—consider openness, existing connections, and networking potential (“person of peace”—Luke 10).
- Keep church units small to maximize connection points.
- Imagine if every member covenanted to bring five disciples in ten years, who then disciple five each (repeating five times): twenty-five people could generate over 78,000 new disciples in a decade.
- Extend this thinking to church planting as well.

## Insights from *The Starfish and the Spider*

- Spiders: centralized bodies, death occurs if the head is lost.
- Starfish: decentralized, no central head, every arm can regenerate the whole.
    - Starfish are networks—everything needed to reproduce is present throughout the body.

### The Tipping Point

*Malcolm Gladwell* identifies three factors that amplify the spread of ideas:

#### 1. The Law of the Few

Success depends on “connectors” (who link people), “mavens” (who disseminate information), and “salesmen” (who persuade others).

- **Connectors:** Know many people across contexts; have traits of hospitality, apostolic, evangelistic, and pastoral gifts.
- **Mavens:** Bear knowledge, teach others; gifted in wisdom, prophecy, faith, discernment, teaching.
- **Salesmen:** Persuaders; contagious in attitude and message, often evangelists, prophets, teachers, apostles.

#### 2. Stickiness

Stickiness makes messages memorable and transformative.

**Six Principles for Stickiness:**
1. **Simplicity:** Prioritize clarity; create ideas both simple and profound.
2. **Unexpectedness:** Surprise to grab attention and inspire curiosity.
3. **Concreteness:** Use sensory, action-based language and examples.
4. **Credibility:** Offer ways for people to test and verify.
5. **Emotion:** Connect at a feeling level; make people care.
6. **Stories:** Move people to action through narrative.

#### 3. The Power of Context

Trends "tip" when the environment is right. Sometimes small changes in context lead to significant receptivity—the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman (John 4) illustrates this.

## Session 1: Explore (Discussion)

- Highlight a key idea from the section—why is it significant?
- Explain organic systems or communitas in your own words.
- What excites or concerns you about these ideas?
- What are the best practices? Can you add others?
- What questions arise? How might your group grow in this area?

## Session 2: Evaluate (Reflection)

- Are organic systems/communitas a strength or weakness for your group?
- Does the majority of your group understand and believe these concepts?
- How is commitment demonstrated? Give examples.
- When has the community best exemplified this? What factors contributed?
- What are the main issues or challenges ahead? Where might resistance occur?

## Session 3: Employ (Action)

- What changes are needed in the next 12 months?
- What should start, stop, or change?
- What resources or support are needed? Who else should be involved?
- What are your indicators of progress?
- What habits/practices will you integrate?
- List first actionable steps, with dates and responsible participants.

## Session 4: Personal Journal

- Pray, listen, and respond to God’s prompting.
- Record personal insights and group learnings.
- Write a prayer about your intentions and desires.
- If appropriate, share and pray together as a group.

# Communitas, Not Just Community

In tragic events like the Asian tsunami of 2004, people discovered an intense form of togetherness—communitas—that transcends typical notions of community. This comradeship, urgently needed in the church, is the root of Apostolic Genius.

## Liminality and Communitas (Victor Turner)

- **Liminality:** The transitional state or ordeal that disorients and transforms individuals (e.g., initiation rites).
- **Communitas:** Intense comradeship forged during shared ordeals, where social bonds are strengthened and restructured.

Biblically, liminality and communitas are *normative* for the people of God: from Abraham’s risky journey, the Israelites’ exodus, exiles, to the itinerant life of Jesus and Paul.

## Loss of Communitas in Artificial Environments

Artificial environments—detached from meaningful risk and the outside world—cause churches to become inward and missionally ineffective. Risk, adventure, and connection with the world's needs are vital for vitality and survival.

## Mission as the Organizing Principle

Pastor Gordon Cosby observed: Groups with non-missional purposes rarely become missional; only those oriented around mission truly actualize it. The church must organize around mission, not ministry.

A new paradigm integrates God, church, and world—breaking dualistic barriers—so that the church is truly missional and incarnational at the intersection.

## The Journey Matters

Stories, whether ancient (Abraham, David) or mythic (*The Lord of the Rings*), show that journeying together in pursuit of a greater purpose creates profound togetherness and love—true communitas.

# Habits and Practices for Cultivating Communitas

Communitas is an essential element of Apostolic Genius, requiring us to:

1. Develop a transformative vision
2. Position the church within the hub of life
3. Engage in shared endeavors
4. Put adventure back into the venture

## Habit 1: Develop a Transformative Vision

**Practice One:** Create a Daring, Collective Vision  
- Gather the community to shape a compelling future together.
- Dream, collaborate, and integrate individual aspirations into a shared dream.
- Talk about the vision often; find ways to put it into action.

**Practice Two:** Learn About Communitas Together  
- Explore communitas biblically and culturally as a group.
- Watch adventure films, read, and discuss stories about journey and comradeship.
- Provide practical experiences of communitas (e.g., short-term mission trips), then reflect on how to make this normative.

## Habit 2: Position the Church within the Hub of Life

**Practice One:** Build Church Around People  
- Integrate church with daily life—not isolated or artificial environments.
- Evaluate structures and activities: Do they connect with or isolate from broader community?
- Ensure gatherings and worship are accessible and relevant.

**Practice Two:** Maintain Missional-Incarnational Focus  
- Combine personal (yellow space) and social justice (blue space) spirituality, creating "green space" where both meet.
- Seek proximity, frequency, and spontaneity in community engagement.

## Habit 3: Engage in Shared Endeavors

**Practice One:** Joint Community Projects  
- Collaborate with local communities on meaningful initiatives beyond "church work".
- Examples: Environmental care, fundraising, volunteering, overseas development projects.
- Be sure projects are inclusive, non-religious in nature, fostering real camaraderie.

**Practice Two:** Engage in Mission Together  
- Regularly pursue mission and evangelism with other Christians, fostering a “me for the community and the community for the world” ethos.
- Examples: Join sports teams, book clubs, social meetups, or regular public gatherings together.

## Habit 4: Put Adventure Back into the Venture

**Practice One:** Take Risks  
- Move beyond comfort zones; risk and adventure nurture togetherness and spiritual vitality.
- Tackle adaptive challenges in sharing the gospel in today’s world.

**Practice Two:** Experiment  
- Embrace experimentation and change; ask if existing models still serve the mission.
- Continually try new approaches, assessing and adapting as needed.
