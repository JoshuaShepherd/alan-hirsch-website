# Preface

As I write this preface, *The Forgotten Ways* has been out for around fifteen months. I have been genuinely humbled by the positive reception it has received. As an author, I receive a lot of feedback—through letters, emails, or in person—and the nature of this feedback varies significantly. By far the most common response I get from readers is:

> "I know this sounds strange, but I feel that I kind of 'remember' these ideas even though I have never been able to fully articulate them."

At this point, I usually say "hallelujah," because for me it affirms the central idea behind *The Forgotten Ways*: that Apostolic Genius lies latent in all of God's people, and we have simply forgotten how to access it. We have become so numbed by the opiate of institutional religion that we have lost contact with the memory of what we can, and ought, to be.

Another reason for my elation is the deepening conviction that the Spirit is waking His people up to their hidden potential all across the world. The new emergence of apostolic movements is a global phenomenon, as far as I can tell, and it is truly remarkable. We have cause for great hope.

However, another frequent response comes as a question: "How can the ideas in *The Forgotten Ways* be implemented?" Most readers find themselves in organizations that feel worlds away from the movement ethos described in the book, even though they long to move in that direction. It is important to know that, in writing *The Forgotten Ways*, I never intended to develop a missional technique, but rather to awaken a lost imagination. We must delve deep into our collective memories as God's people and "remember" the forgotten ways of apostolic movements. We need to think, to dream, and to have our imaginations charged with possibilities and our hearts inspired by Jesus afresh.

This workbook is not meant to short-circuit that much-needed recalibration, but rather to operationalize it. To do this, I needed help, so I invited Darryn Altclass—a long-time friend and colleague—to write this book with me. Darryn is a dedicated and savvy church planter who has consistently implemented much of the content of *The Forgotten Ways* into real-life practice over many years. He knows me well; we have worked closely together in the Forge Mission Training Network and have shared many missional ideas and dreams over the years. As a local movement pioneer, Darryn initiated Third Place Communities, which we use as the primary test case in this book. We have chosen this network not due to any supposed superiority, but simply because we have both traveled with it over the past few years as they have tried to integrate, with some degree of success, *The Forgotten Ways* into their common life.

We also received invaluable guidance from our friend and colleague Steve Ogne, an experienced trainer, coach, consultant, and author who works for CRM. Steve assisted in summarizing the information and was a faithful sounding board. We thank him for his insightful input along the way.

It is hard not to be perfectionistic about a book like this. I am not sure if we would ever feel it completely meets the need, but we offer it to you nonetheless. More importantly, we offer it to God in the hope that He might use it to advance His kingdom in this critical century.

# A Note to Leaders

The fact that you have begun to read this book indicates not only that you are interested in the theory of *The Forgotten Ways*, but that, at some level, you long to activate them in your own life and in the lives of those around you. This is exactly why we wrote this book.

This is not a theoretical book on mission or missional movements—although it contains some theory—but rather a practical handbook to provide frameworks and suggestions, inspiring God's people into mission. Our main purpose is to stir innovative, missional action for Jesus in this post-Christian world we inhabit.

More specifically, this handbook is a guide to applying the ideas contained in *The Forgotten Ways*. We suggest you use it as a handbook, a kind of missional journal, as you engage the world in mission. Make the book your own: use it well, take notes in the margins, underline, carry it with you, and jot down your ideas and reflections on the road.

Feedback suggests that many who have read *The Forgotten Ways* resonate deeply with the vision of the church articulated within the book. Many reported that they felt they were, in fact, "remembering" something they had somehow forgotten, and that they gained a clearer insight into the life force—what Alan calls "Apostolic Genius"—that pulsates through the early church and similar movements.

We believe the reason for this remembering is that Apostolic Genius actually resides in all authentic expressions of ecclesia, but that it has simply become dormant over time. Many long to see something more akin to movements in the churches and organizations they belong to. However, they feel that the reality of seeing this fulfilled is far beyond their grasp. Others, deeply embedded within various expressions of Christendom, sense that it's an impossible task to transition their church into a missional movement.

Make no mistake: the scope of the change required to shift to the kind of movement described in *The Forgotten Ways* is nothing less than paradigmatic. Every element of mDNA (the components that together encode and form Apostolic Genius) poses a direct challenge to the prevailing ways of doing church and mission. Taken together, all six elements of Apostolic Genius might make the task seem overwhelming, but it is not as difficult as it seems—and certainly not impossible. The Chinese church proves that highly institutionalized forms of Christianity can become powerful, transformative movements given the right circumstances. For the record, we do not believe persecution is necessary to activate Apostolic Genius—less intense, adaptive challenges can, and do, force the church to respond.

Because the church carries the gospel and, by the power of the Spirit, the full coding of Apostolic Genius, the potential for world transformation is always present. God is able and very willing to empower the church to fulfill her missional calling. In fact, we see this as one of the special works of the Holy Spirit: to awaken God's people to their calling and destiny as a movement that can and will change the world.

Akin to waking up to something long forgotten, we believe the church itself will "remember" the forgotten ways of apostolic movements. For this to happen, leaders need to create the right environment and give meaningful vocabulary to what people are experiencing. This is precisely what we hope to achieve in writing this book—to make the forgotten ways, well... less forgotten.

Our hope is to help you, at whatever level—grassroots or strategic leadership, within any form of Christian organization—to reactivate the missional church where you are. We propose to do this by suggesting a set of habits and practices formed around each of the mDNA elements described in *The Forgotten Ways*. We believe this will allow us to "remember" once again what it means to be a transformative movement for Jesus in the West.

# What's Inside?

Each chapter is structured in the same way, so users can expect a degree of uniformity. This approach comprises three main sections:

## 1. Summary of Each mDNA Element

This section provides participants with an overview of each chapter and its corresponding mDNA element. It is relatively free of jargon and should be understandable to most. When somewhat technical phrases are used, it will be the leader's task to provide explanation. A glossary at the back of the book will help with this.

## 2. Suggested Habits and Practices

After each summary, the practical section is arranged into *Habits* and *Practices*. Habits are the overall behaviors we suggest groups adopt in order to appropriate the specific mDNA element, while practices are helpful ideas for living out those habits. Think of habits as the framework of a ladder, and practices as the rungs on which we place our feet.

> **Note:** These are suggested habits and practices—prompts, not prescriptions. Don't try doing them all; you will only exhaust yourself. You may not choose any we suggest, but we hope they will at least stimulate you to find your own.

## 3. Group Learning Process

We wrote this book with a group context in mind. While individuals may choose to read the book alone, we recommend processing the information with others. Our hope is that the examples and discussions in this book will prompt rich dialogue and lead groups into missional action. For this purpose, each chapter concludes with a set of questions for groups to process and apply the principles.

### Recommended Framework for Group Processing

**Session 1: Explore (Talk About It)**
- Ensure everyone reads the chapter in preparation.
- Start with an overview of the mDNA element to clarify the theme and concepts.
- Clarify any unclear words or ideas.
- Designate one person to guide this section; that person should have read the associated chapter from *The Forgotten Ways*.
- Explore the ideas and suggestions presented; ask open-ended questions for group sharing and initial responses.

**Session 2: Evaluate (Reflect Deeper)**
- Encourage deeper reflection and critical thinking.
- Ask questions that prompt prioritization and brainstorming of options and alternatives.
- Identify blockages, resistance, and what is important.

**Session 3: Employ (Act on It)**
- Move the group into action.
- Propose plans of action and steps forward.
- Brainstorm and map options, action steps, and necessary help.
- Ask questions and make statements that provoke action.

**Session 4: Personal Journal**
- After group processing, take time to pray, listen, and respond to God.
- Record your individual impressions and insights.
- Write a prayer expressing your desires to God.
- If appropriate, share your thoughts with the group and pray together.

---

There are two additional sections at the back of the book:
- **Appendix:** Relevant resources and examples referred to throughout the book. Due to the interrelated nature of Apostolic Genius, these resources are applicable to many different sections.
- **Glossary:** The glossary (dictionary of terms) from *The Forgotten Ways*, to clarify potentially obscure phrases and concepts.

# A Call to Action

To avoid the group becoming just another discussion group, we suggest calling them *action groups*, or similar. Our aim is not mere understanding, but informed action. Whether you are using this book to guide a group of cell leaders or a small group trying to activate their cell, view the handbook as a guide to the revolution, and each member as an active participant in the movement. Remember that every Christian has the seed-potential for world transformation; all can and must play a part.

To embed a movement ethos, we suggest recruiting as many people as possible for the journey. Someone should assume responsibility for coordinating the action group. While the handbook is a standalone text, it is important that at least one person in the group has thoroughly read *The Forgotten Ways*—perhaps twice—so that they can guide the journey. Leadership always requires deeper appreciation of the issues.

Alternatively, given that a great way to learn an idea is to teach it to others, you might suggest that every group member takes a turn in teaching the overview. Due to the complexity of the material, you might wish to divide a chapter between two participants.

What follows is important information on how to get the most out of this handbook and maximize impact in your church or organization.

# How to Apply the Apostolic Genius Model

There is no magic formula for applying the ideas contained in *The Forgotten Ways* using this handbook. Much depends on your context and the group's commitment to search for and apply answers. However, we suggest the following:

## Recommended Steps

**1. Encourage Reading of the Primary Text**
- Encourage as many as possible, especially key and influential leaders, to read *The Forgotten Ways*. The text contains complex terminology and introduces many paradigm shifts in our understanding of church and movements. Its comprehensiveness is designed to dislodge prevailing ideas that dominate our imaginations. We have so linked our thinking of church to the institution that we may fail to recognize a more dynamic Jesus movement when we see it.
- Engaging both mind and heart in recovering the forgotten ways of apostolic movements is critical.

**2. Get a Realistic Perspective on Change**
- Every group must consider how long it will take to genuinely embed Apostolic Genius. Established churches can become significantly missional, but transformation will take time, depending on the organization's starting point.
- Be patient, prayerful, and committed to sustaining long-term change. Don't seek quick fixes for complex issues.

**3. Embed mDNA at the Core**
- In applying the Apostolic Genius model, seek to embed mDNA at the heart of your group.
- New church planters have the advantage of laying down the basic movemental approach from the beginning. Existing churches will need to choose a strategic point of departure.
- Ensure each core member engages with the ideas in *The Forgotten Ways* and anticipates integration as you go. Foundational clarity is essential, as corrupted DNA can cause future issues. Leaders must guard against institutionalization over time and intentionally disembed inherited imaginations that block Apostolic Genius.

**4. Use the Apostolic Genius Typology as a Strategic Tool**
- The Apostolic Genius typology can be used to assess proximity to becoming a genuine movement or as a tool for strategic focus.
- Identify the weakest mDNA elements and make them the focus of strategic effort. Once improved, address the next-weakest element, and so on.
- Online assessment tools, such as the missional fitness test at [www.theforgottenways.org](http://www.theforgottenways.org), are available.

**5. Resist the "Silver Bullet" Temptation**
- Avoid treating any single mDNA element as a quick fix. All six elements are necessary for an apostolic movement. While developing one area is beneficial, true movements require the full system.

**6. Create Real-Life Action Heroes**
- Prioritize those who will attempt to practice the concepts over those who master them intellectually. Inspire a culture of experimentation and a pioneering spirit.

It is necessary to acknowledge that churches and organizations in Western contexts may not become exactly like the movements described in *The Forgotten Ways* (e.g., the early church, the Chinese underground church). We live in complex, post-Christian, postmodern cultures, which adds layers of challenge. However, this should not deter us. Grassroots apostolic movements are growing across the West and represent the hope and future of Western Christianity.

Even churches bound to the institutional idea need not despair. Every community that faithfully follows Jesus already has all the latent potential it needs. Our task is not to introduce faddish new ideas, but to awaken the collective memory and conditions for reactivating Apostolic Genius. Begin by using the strategic process described above and move towards the kind of church expressed in apostolic movements. Realistically, most of our contexts will be hybrids—part organic, part institutional. The challenge is to increasingly apply the Apostolic Genius typology and all its elements. When the six elements are present and interacting, spontaneous expansion can occur.

# Rationale for the Handbook

Two interrelated educational philosophies guided the formation of this handbook:

## 1. Acting Our Way Into a New Way of Thinking

Transformation is best initiated by action, rather than by theory alone. The gospel story itself demonstrates this: Jesus called disciples, lived and ministered with them, and mentored them through real life. Discipleship was life-on-life. Serious intellectual engagement matters, but transformation happens through active engagement in the world—not just in the classroom.

Western Christianity, influenced by Hellenistic (Greek) ideas, has often prioritized knowledge and philosophy over embodied learning. In contrast, Jesus and the early church operated with a Hebraic worldview—concerned with obedience, concrete existence, and holistic involvement.

Merely providing information in hopes of new thinking (and, by extension, new behavior)—the classic Hellenistic approach—has seldom resulted in genuine change. History and experience show that transformation requires acting our way into new thinking.

## 2. Core Practices vs. Core Values

Many organizations create core values statements to shape behavior, but these often become mere "motherhood statements." If practices aligned with values are not developed and implemented, transformation will not occur.

Focus efforts on practices that embody values within the community's ordinary rhythms. For instance, if hospitality is a core value, seek natural ways for the community to practice hospitality together.

## Calling for a Conspiracy of Little Jesuses

The instinct, power, and genius of the early church rest within God's people's memory. We call pioneering, mission-hearted groups to stir that memory into action. The hope of Western Christianity rests with Christians living out their calling as God's people in their everyday settings.

> "Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it."
> 
> —attributed to Johann Wolfgang Goethe

Ever since Jesus began his ministry, God has called for a movement of "Little Jesuses" to follow Him into the world and unleash the redemptive genius embedded in the gospel message. In the current Western context, we must be willing to break out of a stifling herd instinct and find God again within the advancing kingdom.

# Introduction to The Forgotten Ways

> "After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force—the movement is natural, arising spontaneously. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results."
>
> —*I Ching*

Before delving into the details of practicing the forgotten ways, it is important to review the core ideas. For those who have not read the original text, or who wish to refresh their memory, we offer the following summary:

---

> Imagine there was a power which lies hidden at the very heart of God's people. Suppose this power was built into the initiating 'stem cell' of the church by the Holy Spirit, but buried and lost through centuries of neglect and disuse. Imagine that if rediscovered, this hidden power could unleash remarkable energies that would propel Christianity well into the twenty-second century. Is this not something that we, who love God and his cause, would give almost anything to recover?

The notion of latent, inbuilt missional potency is no fantasy. There are primal forces that lie latent in every Jesus community and every true believer. This phenomenon is observable in the history's most outstanding Jesus movements, and, in certain expressions, is being recovered in Western Christianity today—not without significant challenge and resistance.

The fact that you are reading this book signifies your interest in a more authentic ecclesia, as well as some awareness of the dramatic changes in worldview that have occurred in culture over the past fifty years. Whether labeled modern to post-modern, or solid modernity to liquid modernity, this shift has been difficult for the church to accept. The familiar maps no longer fit; we face a reality that defies former strategies for church and mission.

Amid the resulting ecclesial future shock, we struggle to grasp our new reality. Churches and church leaders are painfully aware that inherited concepts, language, and ways of thinking are inadequate to explain what is occurring. The issues are not merely intellectual, but also spiritual, emotional, and existential. The twenty-first century presents a daunting array of challenges—terrorism, technological innovation, environmental crisis, consumerism, and discontinuous change.

In this context, we must ask probing questions:
- Will more of the same work?
- Do we have inherited resources to meet this situation?
- Can a reworked Christendom model, with ultimate tweaks, provide the answer?

If we are honest, inherited formulas are insufficient. Much new thinking simply refines past approaches and techniques, reworking theological "software" while ignoring the "hardware" and "operating system" of the church. We require not only new tools but a new paradigm: a fundamental transformation in our thoughts, perceptions, and values—especially regarding church and mission.

The answer is to reach deep—not only into our recent past, but to the very roots of what it means to be Jesus' people. The challenges of this century threaten our existence but also present an extraordinary opportunity to rediscover our core.

## The Forgotten Ways: Primary Concepts

*The Forgotten Ways* can be described as a work of missional ecclesiology, because it explores the nature of Christian movements and the church as shaped by Jesus and his mission. Do not be fooled by technical language: when true to its calling, the church is the most potent force for transformational change the world has ever seen. This book was written in the hope that the church in the West can, by the Spirit's power, arouse and reengage the amazing power within.

---

## A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with a Single Question

In 2003, I attended a seminar on the missional church. The speaker asked:

> "How many Christians do you think there were in the year AD 100?"  
> "How many Christians do you think there were just before Constantine, say, AD 310?"

Here is the surprising answer:

| Year      | Number of Christians                  |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| AD 100    | As few as 25,000                     |
| AD 310    | Up to 20,000,000                     |

The haunting question follows: *How did they do this?* How did they grow from a small movement to the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?

In seeking that answer, I discovered what I call *Apostolic Genius*—the inbuilt life force and guiding mechanism of God's people. The living elements of this phenomenon I have tagged missional DNA, or *mDNA* for short.

But consider the context:
- They were an illegal religion, sometimes severely persecuted.
- They had no church buildings as we know them—only small, converted houses at times.
- They did not have the complete Scriptures—the canon was still being assembled.
- They had no formal institutions or professional leadership as we understand them.
- They did not have programs and structures common today: no seeker-sensitive services, youth groups, worship bands, seminaries, or commentaries.
- They made it hard to join: aspiring converts underwent significant initiation periods.

Despite having none of the things we assume are necessary, the early church grew from 25,000 to 20 million in 200 years. *How did they do it?*

The answer lies in the powerful mystery of church in its most authentic form.

---

## Examples of Apostolic Genius

The phenomenon appears not only in the early church but also in the contemporary Chinese underground church. At the time of Mao's rise to power, the church in China—modeled on Western forms—numbered about two million. After decades of violent purges, with all missionaries expelled, churches nationalized, leaders killed or jailed, and all public Christian gatherings banned, it was expected that Christianity would be eradicated.

Yet, when the Bamboo Curtain was lifted, missionaries discovered the church had flourished beyond imagination—estimates ranged from 60 million upwards. David Aikman, in *Jesus in Beijing*, suggests as many as 80 million. The Chinese church had no Bibles (sometimes one page per house church), no professional clergy, no official structure, and no mass meetings—yet it grew enormously.

Similar patterns can be seen elsewhere. By the end of John Wesley's life, one in thirty English men and women were Methodists. In 1776, less than 2% of Americans were Methodists; by 1850, the movement claimed 34% of the population. *How did they do it?*

These are "dangerous stories" because they subvert us into a journey toward more radical, authentic Christianity.

## The Components of Apostolic Genius: A Preview

Einstein said, "When the solution is simple, God is speaking." Following his advice, I have discerned six elements which combine to create Apostolic Genius (*mDNA*). These form a complex and living structure—a paradigm grid for assessing current church and missional understanding.

### The Six Elements of mDNA

**1. Jesus Is Lord**
- The simple confession at the center of every significant Jesus movement: "Jesus is Lord." It is the claim of one God over every aspect of life and the obedient response of his people.

**2. Disciple-Making**
- The irreplaceable, lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message. Disciple-making is essential and must be structured into every church's basic formula.

**3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse**
- The dynamic outward thrust and deepening impulse which together seed and embed the gospel into different cultures and people groups.

**4. Apostolic Environment**
- Refers to apostolic influence and the fertile environment necessary to initiate and sustain the phenomenal movements of God, including the relevant leadership required for growth.

**5. Organic Systems**
- Appropriate structures for metabolic growth. Remarkable Jesus movements grow because they lack centralized institutions that block growth through control. These movements feel like networks, spread like viruses.

**6. Communitas, Not Community**
- The most vigorous forms of community emerge from a shared ordeal. Communitas is formed in communities who define themselves by a mission beyond themselves—a risky, adventurous journey.

Apostolic Genius is the full system of these mutually informing elements. When all six are present and dynamically related, and an adaptive challenge acts as catalyst, Apostolic Genius is activated.

---

# The Heart of It All

Paul, exploring the mystery of God's involvement with the world, bursts into doxology:

> "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!  
> 'Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?'  
> 'Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?'  
> For from him and through him and to him are all things.  
> To him be the glory forever! Amen."  
> —Romans 11:33–36

At the core of Christian movements is an encounter with the One True God. Without this spiritual center, we cannot understand or invoke the power that infused the great movements of church history.

Distill the message, and you discover: at the heart of all great movements is the recovery of a simple Christology. In a literal sense, they are "Jesus movements."

---

## Hear, O Israel

What is the uncluttered message distilled by these remarkable movements? It is found in biblical monotheism—an encounter with the One God who claims and saves us.

When the early Christians confessed, "Jesus is Lord," they invoked Israel's primary declaration: "Yahweh is Lord," rooted in the *Shema*:

> "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.  
> Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.  
> These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts.  
> Impress them on your children.  
> Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.  
> Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.  
> Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates."  
> *(Deuteronomy 6:4–9)*

This declaration has direct and far-reaching implications. Yahweh is the One God who rules over every aspect of life—home, field, politics, work, and more. The religious task is to honor the One God in all aspects of life, rejecting the tyranny of the many gods.
