# The Centrality of Christ: Monotheism and Faith in Practice

> "Jesus is Lord" is the covenant claim of God over our lives—the unshakable center of the Christian creed and confession.

## Practical Monotheism: The Heart of Biblical Faith

The biblical confession of God's oneness is not merely a doctrinal statement, but a radical claim: there is only one God who is Lord over all creation. This practical monotheism stands at the epicenter of Israel's faith and, by extension, the biblical understanding of faith itself. God's concern extends to every aspect of a believer's life—there is no distinction in a biblical worldview between the sacred and the secular.

All of life belongs to God. True holiness, therefore, means bringing every sphere under His lordship. This comprehensive claim is the essence of biblical worship. The incarnation of Christ does not alter this fundamental monotheism, but restructures it around Jesus. He is the focal point of our relationship with God; Jesus does not just initiate the new covenant—He is the New Covenant.

When the early church proclaimed, "Jesus is Lord," they made the same claim and with the same implications as Israel did in the Shema. This lordship excludes all other claims to loyalty. It is the unmovable heart of the faith, a truth our spiritual forebears would not surrender.

# The Heart of Things

At its core, Christianity is a messianic movement, seeking to consistently embody the life, spirituality, and mission of Jesus. We have often made it about other things, but its utter simplicity is discipleship: becoming like Jesus. To recover the ethos of authentic Christianity, our focus must return to Jesus—the Root—and recalibrate our lives around Him.

A truly messianic monotheism eliminates any supposed divide between the "sacred" and "secular." If all the world belongs to God, then every area of life is open to His rule. There can be no "non-God" areas in our lives or culture.

To see life as wholly integrated under God leads to a holistic faith. Rejecting the sacred-secular dualism and submitting all of life to Jesus enables us to live out true holiness. If we do not, while we may confess monotheism, we risk practicing polytheism—dividing our loyalties.

Christ-centered monotheism demands allegiance exactly where rival gods claim it. Today, we are surrounded by idols—consumerism, wealth, and more—vying for our devotion. History shows how easily we can obscure Jesus's centrality amid religious clutter. It is striking how Jesus can be so easily excluded from His own people, as in Revelation 3:20—knocking at the door to His own church.

This section seeks to identify the epicenter of what the text calls "mDNA" and a critical component of Apostolic Genius: the confession, "Jesus is Lord." This is a challenge to take seriously the ongoing, absolute centrality of Jesus for Christianity as a movement and for each community. The sustaining center of early Christianity, and similarly in modern movements like the Chinese underground church, is Christ's Lordship. We must recover this as we meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.

The first step in the revival of Apostolic Genius is the recovery of the lordship of Jesus in its utter simplicity.

# Suggested Habits and Practices

To recover the heart of Apostolic Genius, we must recalibrate every part of our lives around Jesus. What does this mean practically for those seeking to build an influential movement today? Consider the following habits:

1. **Keep Jesus at the Heart of It All**
2. **Get Over Dualism**
3. **Make the Gospels the Primary Text**

---

## Habit 1: Keep Jesus at the Heart of It All

In remarkable Jesus movements, followers connected their faith to Jesus with utter simplicity, removing all unnecessary clutter and embracing a simple Christology. For them, Jesus was the heart of it all, and some even died for this conviction. At its core, Christianity is not a religion but a Jesus-fueled movement that seeks to consistently embody the life, spirituality, and mission of its Founder.

### Practice One: Seek a Fresh Perspective on Jesus

- Pursue a renewed understanding of Jesus's life and mission.
- Approach Jesus anew, setting aside institutional perspectives to focus on the core truths of Christ and His gospel.
- Recognize that the first followers understood Jesus through a Jewish lens; study Jesus's heritage and context to refresh your Christology.

**Recommended Resources:**
- *The Shaping of Things to Come*, Alan Hirsch (ch. 7)
- *ReJesus*, Alan Hirsch & Michael Frost
- *The Jesus I Never Knew*, Philip Yancey
- *The Divine Conspiracy*, Dallas Willard
- *Poet & Peasant* and *Through Peasant Eyes*, Kenneth E. Bailey
- Stanley Hauerwas's commentary on Matthew
- N.T. Wright's works

- Adopt a standard text or Christology resource for your community.
- Watch and discuss movies about Jesus's life in light of the Gospels.
- Frequently read and revisit the Gospels.

### Practice Two: Shape Life and Spirituality on Jesus

- Let Jesus be your model and reference for spirituality.
- Investigate Jesus's spirituality as a group; compare and aspire to it.
- Regularly evaluate all communal activities: "Would Jesus be doing this if He were here?"
- Remove activities not aligned with His mission; eliminate unnecessary clutter.
- Remind yourselves of Jesus's ongoing presence (e.g., a lit candle or empty chair at gatherings).

### Practice Three: Shape Missional Engagement on Jesus

- Pattern all missional engagement after Jesus, the Seeker and Savior of the lost.
- Analyze how Jesus engaged with others, especially those on society's margins.
- Study passages such as John 5:17–20 for insight into Jesus's mission.
- Ask:
  - Whom did Jesus spend time with? Whom do we spend time with?
  - With whom did Jesus eat? Whom do we invite to our tables?

### Practice Four: Shape Leadership on Jesus

- Leadership is an extension of discipleship: its aim is Christlikeness.
- Focus on character, not merely ability.
- Build leadership development on healthy disciple-making processes.
- Study and discuss Jesus's model of leadership (e.g., *In the Name of Jesus* by Henri Nouwen).
- Develop a list of leadership qualities based on Jesus, and use it for regular self-evaluation.

---

## Habit 2: Get Over Dualism

Authentic faith encompasses all of life. Following Jesus excludes other loyalties—and dethrones the false division between sacred and secular.

### Practice One: All-of-Life Alignment

- Realign every aspect of life around Jesus—personally and communally.
- Use the dualism/non-dualism diagrams as templates for evaluation.
- Identify and confess idols; develop practices to break their power.

**Examples:**
- Hold a monthly "buy nothing day."
- Share credit card statements for accountability.
- Abstain from non-essentials and redirect funds to charity.
- Align vocation and career under the lordship of Jesus.

> **Case Study:** *Missio Dei,* a faith community in Melbourne, orders their lives around God's transforming dream, aiming for one act of outward transformation each week, including vocational alignment.

### Practice Two: Hallow the Everyday

Rooted in Hebraic thought, the world is divided into the holy and the not-yet-holy; our task is to sanctify the latter.

- Discuss how ordinary tasks can be made holy (cleaning, shopping, working, eating, etc.).
- Example:  
  - **Eating:** Practice thankfulness, moderation, generosity; include the poor or lonely.
  - **Recreation:** Use time to serve, reflect on God, connect with others.
- Define holiness by what we *do* to hallow the everyday, not what we abstain from.
- Regularly affirm that all of life is sacred.
- Develop a theology that redeems pleasure and passion, tracing them back to God.

#### The Redemption of Pleasure

Western Christianity's dualism has often failed to connect pleasure with God, resulting in alienation and a negative witness. Recovering a redemptive framework for pleasure can be a powerful missional asset, connecting people's deepest motivations to God.

### Practice Three: Redefine and Widen Your View of Worship

Worship is not confined to certain times or places but is to infuse all of life.

- Explore the biblical scope of worship in scripture and practice.
- Discuss ways the group worships outside of corporate gatherings.
- Example Definition: Worship is "offering our world back to God" (Alan Hirsch).
- Recommended Reading: *Exiles*, Michael Frost, ch. 12 & 13

**Frost's List: Ways We Love and Worship God**
- Loving others
- Obeying Jesus
- Lingering in God's presence
- Speaking about God
- Longing for Christ's return
- Forsaking other gods and idols
- Laying down our lives
- Loving creation
- Forgiving others

#### Releasing the Glory of God

The Jewish mystical concept of Shekinah suggests God's glory is scattered and imprisoned in creation, released through holy action. While metaphorical, it pictures our mission: by acting in holiness, we release God's glory in the world.

---

## Habit 3: Make the Gospels the Primary Text

To keep Jesus at our collective core, the Gospels must be our primary texts. While we honor all scripture, we read it through the lens of Jesus.

### Practice One: Recalibrate Around Jesus's Core Teaching

- Focus deeply on the central teachings of Jesus, especially the parables and the Sermon on the Mount.
- Reflect on how Jesus's words apply today.
- Use frameworks like the table from *ReJesus* (Hirsch & Frost) to link aspects of Jesus's life and teaching to discipleship and concrete examples.

### Practice Two: Cycle Through the Gospels

- Establish communal rhythms where the Gospels are read regularly and repeatedly.
- Example: Read one Gospel per month as a community.
- Encourage shared reflection, journaling, and discussion.
- Organize creative practices, such as urban Gospel readings or Stations of the Cross.

### Practice Three: Keep the Gospels Central to Learning

- Integrate Jesus and the Gospels into all teaching, both formal and informal.
- Use resources such as *According to God's Plan* (Graeme Goldsworthy).
- Coordinate studies across small and large groups for deeper impact.
- Distribute weekly Gospel passages to your community.

> **Example:** *Third Place Communities (TPC)* uses various tactics to keep Jesus central—cycling through the Gospels, reading core texts, viewing DVDs, hosting workshops, and even using reminders like "What Would Jesus Brew?" shirts.

# The Importance of Disciple Making

> "Disciple making is perhaps the most critical element… it determines the quality of the whole."

Making disciples is foundational, as it aims to embody the character and mission of Jesus. Every major movement in Christian history has thrived by prioritizing the generation of authentic disciples. Conversely, the church in the West, in its focus on intellectual assent and seeker-friendliness, has often produced a weaker, consumer-driven faith.

## The Challenge of Consumerism

Consumerism is a powerful rival "religion" offering identity, purpose, and meaning. The church becomes just another vendor of goods and services if it is not intentionally focused on disciple making. We must resist reducing discipleship to passive consumption.

## The Embodiment of Jesus

Missional disciple making means reproducing "little versions" of Jesus throughout society, embodying Christ's presence in a relational, attractive way. Discipleship is not transmitted through programs or books alone, but through life-on-life relationships: leader to community, teacher to disciple.

## The Power of Spiritual Leadership

Authentic leadership flows from spiritual authority grounded in Christlike character, not institutional or positional power. The quality of leadership depends on the quality of discipleship.

## Hitting the Road with Jesus

Jesus's disciples learned "on the road," by acting their way into new ways of thinking. Discipleship is best caught in the "rough-and-tumble of life and mission," not just in classrooms.

---

# Habits and Practices for Disciple Making

1. **Raise the bar on discipleship**
2. **Develop a set of discipleship practices**
3. **Activate the priesthood of all believers**

---

## Habit 1: Raise the Bar on Discipleship

### Practice One: Make Discipleship Real Discipleship

- Establish clear, well-articulated discipleship norms; articulate what is expected of each member.
- Ensure mission is non-negotiable—a central organizing principle.
- Embed standards of hospitality, generosity, care for creation, and evangelism in your community's fabric.

### Practice Two: Promote Core Spiritual Disciplines

**Core Disciplines:**

**Scripture Engagement:** Read and apply God's Word practically, focusing on how it calls, shapes, transforms, and sends us.

**Prayer:** Include practices like solitude, contemplation, and confession. Use diverse traditions for enrichment.

**Worship & Service:** These are inseparable; worship is offering our world to God through acts of service, generosity, evangelism, and justice.

**Stewardship:** Responsibility over money, resources, time, and creation.
- Monitor use of time and money; hold each other accountable
- Care for the environment; make ethical choices in investments and consumption

**Community:** Spiritual growth and Christlikeness are inseparable from participation in community. Love for one another is a spiritual discipline and a core witness.

---

## Habit 2: Develop a Set of Discipleship Practices

### Practice One: Create Common Practices

- Collaboratively develop practical community commitments reflecting your core discipleship standards.
- Ensure practices are integrated with your congregation's mission and are:
  - Achievable but challenging
  - Clearly articulated (e.g., via an acronym)
  - Understood and owned by the group
  - Regularly discussed to maintain focus and avoid legalism

### Practice Two: Develop a Contagious Discipleship Culture

- Aim for a critical mass of individuals taking discipleship seriously. Their practices will influence the broader group, creating a tipping point for communal transformation.
