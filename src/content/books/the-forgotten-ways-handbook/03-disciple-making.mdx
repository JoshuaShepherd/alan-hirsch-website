## Fostering Discipleship Within Community

Encouraging a significant portion of your community—such as one-quarter of your members—to meet regularly in small groups for prayer and accountability can decisively influence the culture of your group. When discipleship is expected of everyone, and when key people participate in discipleship practices, a community ethos emerges in which spiritual growth is seen as both normal and desirable.

### Talk About and Expect Growth

Word-of-mouth is a powerful agent of change; our environment is greatly influenced by our conversations. To cultivate a culture of spiritual growth:

- Teach about spiritual growth from the Scriptures.
- Speak about growth in everyday conversations.
- Provide tangible examples, and encourage sharing of personal growth stories.

By regularly discussing the importance of spiritual maturation, you remind the community of the goal to become more like Jesus. If members are not growing, the group should encourage them to do so. Environments are shaped not only by what we say, but also by what we do. Practicing spiritual disciplines together—rather than approaching discipleship as solely an individual pursuit—also affects the communal ethos.

### Provide Resources and Tools

To support engagement in spiritual disciplines, compile and share resources:

- **Lectio Divina and Examen**: Simple, Catholic traditions for engaging Scripture and prayer.
- **Exilio**: A group resource based on _Exiles_ by Michael Frost, featuring reflection and action prompts and video material.
- **Shapevine**: Offers a wide array of online training modules.
- **Resource Library**: Gather study materials, DVDs, conference information, websites, networks, books, and resources from various traditions and cultures.

These resources should be easily shareable—handouts, email, or even text messages—and tailored to your community's needs.

### Lead by Example

Leaders must model spiritual growth. You cannot expect others to pursue a discipleship lifestyle that leaders do not demonstrate. As the saying goes, "Habits are more easily caught than taught." Set a baseline for discipleship that is higher than the minimum, create a leadership covenant, and hold one another accountable.

## Discipleship Group Models

### DNA Groups at SmallBoatBigSea

**DNA** stands for Discipleship, Nurture, and Accountability. Every community member is encouraged to join a DNA: a group of two to five people meeting regularly for discussion, support, and prayer—anywhere from cafés to homes to beaches. Accountability questions might include:

- Whom have you blessed this week?
- With whom have you eaten?
- Have you sensed any promptings from God?
- What scriptures or resources have encouraged your growth?
- How have you sensed yourself carrying out God's work?

### Life Transformation Groups (LTGs) at CMA

Neil Cole (Church Multiplication Associates) developed Life Transformation Groups—small (2–3 people, same gender) groups for Bible reading, personal accountability, and prayer. LTGs meet weekly and multiply once they grow past three members. All are invited to participate, fostering distributed culture of disciple-making.

## Habit 3: Activate the Priesthood of All Believers

Movements that change the world are "people movements"—every believer as a minister, empowered for mission. This is rooted in the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers (Ephesians 2:10). Empowerment is a core leadership function; Jesus modeled this by sending his disciples into active, meaningful service soon after calling them.

### Practice One: Empower People to Utilize Their Gifts

As per Ephesians 4, discipleship is about equipping God’s people for service. God has gifted every believer uniquely. Practical steps to empower people include:

- Encourage completion of a spiritual gift analysis (e.g., at [www.theforgottenways.org/apest/](http://www.theforgottenways.org/apest/)).
- Use 360-degree evaluations involving peer review.
- Map out community gifts and explore, via retreats, how these might serve your group’s mission. 
- Organize regular gatherings for those with similar gifts.
- Commission all members for service in every context—business, education, trades, or church.

People should be recognized as agents of the Kingdom from the moment they come to faith.

### Practice Two: Action-Reflection

Discipleship is forged in everyday life, blending action and reflection. Deuteronomy encourages forming faith through daily life rhythms. Follow Jesus’ model: on-the-road, in the world—not just in formal religious settings. Establish:

- Regular times to act, reflect, pray, and build theological frameworks together.
- Both formal and informal practices of action–reflection.

### Practice Three: Coaching

Coaching is an intentional relationship where a coach helps the individual grow in Christlikeness through setting goals, reflection, and accountability.

The process is typically:

1. Set goals and evaluate progress.
2. Engage in discipleship.
3. Reflect with the coach on experiences.
4. The coach helps identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, asking probing questions.

Coaches may be from inside or outside the community. Make monthly coaching compulsory for leaders and stakeholders. Good coaches:

- Listen actively
- Ask insightful questions
- Help clarify and celebrate goals
- Challenge, train, and disciple holistically

#### Steve Ogne’s Seven Habits for Great Coaching

1. **LISTEN** for where God is working.
2. **CARE** for personal needs.
3. **CELEBRATE** what God is doing.
4. **STRATEGIZE** for missional effectiveness.
5. **TRAIN** in essential ministry skills.
6. **DISCIPLE** the whole person.
7. **CHALLENGE** specifically.

#### TPC Coaching Ethos

Coaching is embedded in their disciple-making process, offering regular coaching for members—sometimes by external mentors. Regular coaching questions include:

- What is God brewing within you? _(transformation)_
- What is God brewing amongst you? _(participation)_
- What is God brewing around you? _(contribution)_

## Group Reflection & Action Sessions

### Session 1: Explore _(talk about it)_
- What idea stands out to you? Why?
- Explain discipleship and disciple-making in your own words to a group member.
- Which ideas excite or concern you?
- What best practices should be considered (add your own suggestions)?
- What questions do you have?
- How do you envision group growth in this area?

### Session 2: Evaluate _(reflect deeper)_
- Is discipleship a strength or weakness in your group?
- Does the group understand and believe in discipleship?
- How is commitment to discipleship demonstrated? (Provide examples.)
- When was the group strongest at disciple-making?
- What factors contributed to that?
- What are the key ongoing challenges and barriers? Where might resistance arise?

### Session 3: Employ _(act on it)_
- What needs to happen in the next twelve months?
- What should you start, stop, or continue?
- What information and resources are needed?
- Who else should be involved?
- How will you measure growth? What are the key indicators?
- List habits and practices to integrate in the next year.
- Steps to achieve these goals:  
  | What (Activity/Action) | When (Date) | Who (Leader/Participants) |
  |------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
  |                        |             |                          |
  |                        |             |                          |

### Session 4: Personal Journal
- After reflection, pray, listen, and note what God is prompting you to do.
- Record your impressions and group insights.
- Write a prayer expressing your desires to God.
- Share and pray together if appropriate.

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What am I sensing from God?
- What is my prayer?

## The Missional-Incarnational Impulse

> "The Forgotten Ways describes the mission of God as a 'sneeze-like' influence that releases the outward flow of the movement of God like seeds in the wind."

Mission is more than an activity; it is God's initiative to restore and heal creation—His sending action in human history. The missional-incarnational impulse embodies this sending, propelling the church outward and embedding the gospel deeply in context, inspired by the incarnation of Christ.

### A Framework for Incarnation and Mission

- **Presence**: God, in Jesus, moved into the neighborhood. Relationships and close connection are essential.
- **Proximity**: Jesus engaged people from all walks of life; so must we.
- **Powerlessness**: Serve with humility and reject power-based leadership.
- **Proclamation**: Be prepared to share the gospel wherever you go.

By living incarnationally, mission fits seamlessly into everyday rhythms of life, bridging relationships regardless of context.

## Habits and Practices of Missional-Incarnational Living

### Habit 1: Going Out

The "out" habit is about moving God's people into the hub of life, fostering mission through:

#### Practice One: Proximity

- Move into neighborhoods where mission is focused.
- Spend time in local gathering places (cafés, sports clubs, pubs, parks)—these natural habitats foster relationships.

#### Practice Two: Frequency

- Regularly visit the same places to build familiarity.
- Shop at the same local stores.
- Attend school pickup or community events regularly.
- Share meals or social time with both group and non-group members.

#### Practice Three: Spontaneity

- Make space for impromptu connection.
- Reorder schedules collectively and individually to allow for spontaneity.
- Minimize "in-house" meetings; invest time in community presence.
- Organize gatherings with flexibility, responding to opportunities as they arise.

#### Practice Four: Ask Missionary Questions

Reflect regularly as a group:

- Where are people gathering and experiencing community?
- What are the community’s existential and spiritual needs?
- Where is God already at work in the community?
- Who is God calling us to serve, and what will church look like here?

#### Practice Five: Find People of Peace

Seek out local leaders and influencers open to spiritual things—"people of peace." These relationships provide organic access to new networks and opportunities for gospel witness.

### Habit 2: Going Deep

Deepening refers to embedding the gospel within the fabric of community through meaningful relationships and engagement.

#### Practice One: Meaningful Engagement

- Invest time in genuine friendships.
- Participate in rites of passage (weddings, funerals, birthdays).
- Learn and practice the art of meaningful conversation and active listening.
- Strengthen networks of connected relationships, rather than focusing solely on programs.

#### Practice Two: Proclamation

- Share the gospel relationally and conversationally.
- Excite curiosity through stories; provoke wonder and awe.
- Explore spiritual questions, focusing on ways people have already experienced God’s grace.
- Assume God is already at work in every person’s life.

#### Practice Three: Holy Living

- Live lives that embody the message—actions and integrity.
- Celebrate life and practice hospitality, sharing God’s goodness and joy.
- Model a holiness that is attractive, not moralistic or exclusionary.

#### Practice Four: Hospitality

- Regularly share meals with others, especially the marginalized or poor.
- Host celebrations, creating environments where belonging precedes believing.
- Practice inclusive, joyful hospitality modeled on Jesus’ own approach.

#### Practice Five: Contextualizing Community

- Encourage new Christian communities to form their own expressions, contextualized to the surrounding culture.
- Listen deeply to the community’s story, needs, and rhythms.
- Redeem and affirm what is good; gently challenge and reshape what is not.

#### Practice Six: Send

- Continue to send out teams or groups to seed and embed the gospel in new contexts.
- Ensure the church remains a sending, reproducing movement rather than a static institution.
