---# Practices, Assessment, and Glossary: Patterns in Missional Community Life

## Community Habits and Orders

### The BELLS Order (Small Boat Big Sea, Sydney)

The Small Boat Big Sea mission community on the northern beaches of Sydney has developed a simple order for communal life, summarized by the acronym **BELLS**:

- **Bless:** We bless at least one other member of our community every day.
- **Eat:** We share meals with other members of our community at least three times.
- **Listen:** We commit ourselves weekly to listening to the promptings of God in our lives.
- **Learn:** We read from the Gospels each week and remain diligent in learning more about Jesus.
- **Sent:** We see our daily lives as an expression of our sent-ness by God into this world.

### The TEMPT3 Covenant (Red Network, Melbourne)

Red, emerging from the South Melbourne Restoration Community, is now a network of missional gatherings across Melbourne. Each group upholds a covenant summarized by **TEMPT3**, which expresses core values as follows:

- **Together We Follow**
    > "We commit ourselves as the people of God to live an authentic expression of Christian community."  
    We journey in discipleship together.

- **Engagement with Scripture**
    > "We commit ourselves to constantly engage with Holy Scripture, recognizing that it is our handbook for life."  
    We let the Bible interpret us, accept it as God's word, and remain committed to its study—always within community.

- **Mission**
    > "We commit ourselves to join with God in His missionary endeavor to grow the Kingdom by sharing our faith, multiplying our communities, and welcoming strangers."  
    We communicate God's love through our words and deeds, seeking justice, mercy, and gospel communication.

- **Passion for Jesus**
    > "We commit ourselves to passionately reach out to Jesus as we respond to His love for us."  
    Experiencing Jesus's radical love fuels our everyday discipleship.

- **Transformation Together**
    > "We commit ourselves to walk the road of discipleship together and to become more like Jesus every day."  
    We reject consumerism and self-interest, choosing instead to die to self and find true life in Jesus.

## Charting and Assessing Missional DNA (mDNA)

### Charting APEST Results

*(Insert Figures 12, 13, & 14 here)*

### Charting mDNA Elements

Third Place Communities use the following process to reflect on mDNA elements within their mission:

- **Jesus is Lord**
- **Missional-Incarnational Systems**
- **Making Environment**

**Evaluation Considerations:**

1. Do the majority understand and believe this concept?
2. How is commitment demonstrated? When were we best at this?
3. What are contributing factors?
4. What should we do in the next twelve months?
5. What do we need to fine-tune, start, or let go of?
6. What resources or people do we need?
7. How will we know if we have grown? What are the key indicators?

### Example: mDNA Assessment Chart

Create a chart listing your church’s common habits and practices in the left column. As a group, check which mDNA elements each practice activates. This assessment can guide the selection and refinement of your habits to cover as many mDNA elements as possible.

#### Sample Assessment

## Praying the Scriptures: Lectio Divina

**An Ancient Tradition of Listening for Christ**

1. **Reading (*lectio*)**  
   - One person reads the text aloud (twice).
   - Silence while each repeats a word or phrase that speaks to their heart.
   - Each shares the word or phrase with the group (no elaboration).

2. **Meditation (*meditatio*)**  
   - Another person reads the text once more.
   - Silence for two minutes: “Where does the reading touch my life today?”
   - Each shares briefly: “I hear, I see...”

3. **Prayer (*oratio*)**
   - Third reading by another person.
   - Silence for two minutes: “I believe God wants me to today/this week.”
   - Each shares; after full sharing, pray for the person on your right.

4. **Contemplation (*contemplatio*)**
   - Rest silently in God's presence.

**Preparation:**  
Find a comfortable place, focus on your breathing, and listen to the world around you as you slow down for contemplation.

## The Six Thinking Hats of Edward de Bono

> "The six hats represent six modes of thinking and are directions to think rather than labels for thinking. The method promotes fuller input from more people and encourages performance over ego defense."
>
> —Edward de Bono, *New Thinking for a New Millennium*

- **White Hat:** Data, information, what is known and what needs to be known.
- **Red Hat:** Feelings, intuition, hunches, and emotions.
- **Black Hat:** Caution, critical judgment, reasons things might not work.
- **Yellow Hat:** Optimism, feasibility, and logical positive thinking.
- **Green Hat:** Creativity, new ideas, alternatives, possibilities.
- **Blue Hat:** Process control, overviews, summaries, and planning.

Encourage group members to contribute from any hat, regardless of their initial viewpoint.
