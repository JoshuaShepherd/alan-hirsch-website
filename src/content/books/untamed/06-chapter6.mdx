# Refocusing the Family

> The problem for someone like me who desires that his children lead successful, competent lives, is knowing that the cost of this may at times be insensitivity to others, that in urging them to do well I may well be urging them to be inconsiderate, lacking in thoughtfulness about others. In other words, the Christian values of community and equality are not the easiest standards to hold up when you’re also interested in perpetuating your privileged situation in society through your children and your own behavior.

> The only home which is safe for anyone to be born into is the home that is ready to welcome someone who does not belong there by right of kinship, but belongs there in virtue of hospitality.

We’ll never forget, years ago, the confused and distressed look on one of our friend’s faces. Cath had just returned from speaking at a fairly large, middle-class church in the Bible belt of our city. She had been invited to speak about the work she did with the possibility of generating some type of support, and not simply the checkbook variety.

The youth organization Cath worked with had developed a fairly effective ministry to young teenage girls who, for various reasons, found themselves homeless. One aspect of the ministry was to provide accommodations, so they had set up a number of community homes in which our friend worked both as a lead tenant and director. The problem was that they had a huge waiting list of young homeless girls who couldn’t be accommodated because they had run out of rooms.

During her message that morning, Cath appealed to the congregation and asked them if anyone among them was willing to house some of these girls over the short-to-medium term. She emphasized that it wouldn’t be a permanent thing, and that she wasn’t asking for them to provide for the girls’ emotional and psychological needs, as the ministry would look after them. All she was asking for was just a roof over their heads, without which they may remain on the streets.

After the service, Cath said she was inundated with people wishing her well and congratulating her on the good work she was doing, and some promised to pray regularly for her. Some who were deeply touched gave money, but no one, not one person, offered to take in one of the many girls they had on their books.

Cath came back from church that morning pretty deflated. She said she didn’t really need the money, or even the well wishes; what she really needed was accommodation. What disturbed her more than anything was that she knew that many of those families did indeed have spare rooms in their homes, and had ample resources to make a difference. But for reasons probably related to a sense of safety and security for their family, and perhaps fear of the stranger, these Christians chose not to open their homes.

Contrast the story above with that of the folks of Urban Neighbors of Hope, friends of ours who are part of a missional order among the poor. When they are confronted with a homeless person, they have the policy of asking themselves, “Are there any reasons why we should not take this person in?” If they can’t come up with any good reason, and if they have place, they take them in.

What’s going on here? Why would so many followers of Jesus close their hearts to people in desperate need? In the Bible, hospitality is just assumed to be part of life. Living in a culture that valued extended relationships, people inherited a heightened sense of obligation and felt a personal responsibility to give hospitality to both friends and strangers. The Gospels portray Jesus entertaining and being entertained in many different situations (some of these took place around the table of people who were actually hostile to what Jesus was all about). And we are directly encouraged to entertain strangers with the possibility that they might just be angels (Heb. 13:2). Surely our lack of hospitality points to something deficient in our culture, our sense of missional obligation, and therefore also our discipleship.

## Refocusing the Family

We think that one of the major reasons for our current lack of hospitality to the stranger lies in the modern redefinition of what it means to be family. The writing in this area is extensive and complex and outside of the scope of this book, but it seems many would agree that the “nuclear family unit” as we now experience it has a very recent history—some say as little as fifty years! Certainly it has its early roots in the breakdown of extended families that started in the nineteenth century with the industrialization of Western culture, as people moved from the country to work in factories located in the newly formed cities. In this situation, usually the father went to work long hours away from the family, leaving the raising of children to the mother and other nonworking members of the family. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, spouses, children, and servants would simply work together to produce goods, and the family would include relatives and friends within the social unit. But under the pressures of mass marketing in the twentieth century, the process of narrowing the family, now seen primarily as a unit of consumption, was accelerated. Over time, the family has been reduced to a unit consisting of parents (single or mixed) and 2.2 kids. The net result is the narrowing of the vision and purpose of the family from that of a supportive and productive unit to one of conspicuous consumption, whose aim is to climb the social ladder.

Now, in the single family home, both parents pursue careers, often in order to pursue the idealized vision of the middle-class home created by late capitalism. Responsibilities beyond that of the direct nuclear family have been relinquished, and have narrowed even more as child rearing was eventually outsourced to professionals and schools. People now work all day in pursuit of a materialistic vision of the good life generated by marketing, only to come home exhausted to a house full of appliances and alienated relationships. Family relations are stretched to a maximum: witness the skyrocketing divorce rates and increasing alienation of children from their parents and from each other. The so-called “screenagers” are now raised and mentored by screens, be they TV, computers, video-games, or movie theaters—and all this in the name of keeping our means of production operating at peak capacity (The Matrix again?).

Under such enormous cultural pressure and stress, families have become highly protective. They have become fortresses from the world around us—defensive units designed to keep the cultural onslaughts at bay. Sociologist Christopher Lasch calls it our “haven in a heartless world” in a book on the family by that name. This is “our” space, and those we may “invite” into that space are carefully chosen based on whether they will upset the delicate status quo, inconvenience us, or pose a threat to our perceived safety. In other words, visitors, especially strange ones, stress us out. And while this is in some sense culturally understandable, the negative result in terms of our spirituality is that the family has effectively become a pernicious idol—a sphere where the commands of the Shema are no longer applied to the whole of life. Culture has once again trumped our social responsibility. In such a situation, missional hospitality is seen as a threat, not as an opportunity to extend the kingdom; so an idol (a sphere of life dissociated from the claims of God) is born. None of us intended this; we simply inherited it. We never stopped to seriously question it. But we can, and must, do something about it.

## Soft Centers

Part of the problem is that the church, a bastion of conservative values, has now taken the family to be the frontier in its stand against the eroding forces of secularizing culture. In many ways this is right—the family is eroding—but the problem is that we find ourselves defending a non-biblical idea of the family! It’s not hard to see how this is absolutely disastrous from a missional perspective. Our families and our homes should be places where people can experience a foretaste of heaven, where the church is rightly viewed as a community of the redeemed from all walks of life (Revelation 21). Instead, our fears restrict us from letting go of the control and safety we have spent years cultivating. But as Scott Bader-Saye notes, an ethic based on personal security produces a skewed moral vision. Any sense of personal obligation is tapered down to exclude anything beyond “me and my family.” This culture of fear is totally inconsistent with Jesus’s redemptive vision of the kingdom of God.

The problem is that, by and large, our churches and church leaders are not challenging us to get beyond this captivity. In fact, they end up catering to it by justifying it on biblical grounds. The so-called “family church” usually assumes the very narrow understanding of the nuclear family and gives it theological legitimacy. But the way the Bible conceives the term family and the way we see it are worlds apart. The concerns of the “idol” take precedence over other “social” concerns. As Janet Fishburne points out, a church that focuses its concerns around the needs of the “nuclear” family inevitably tends to become conservative, class-conscious, sexist, and ineffectual in the society at large.

She goes on to say,

> Family idolatry is a tragically misdirected form of religious devotion. It involves a preference for the familiar over the unknown, the local over the universal, and treats the familiar and local as if they were absolute. When Christians direct reverence toward love of family without acknowledging the source of that love, they may imagine they are expressing reverence for Christ when they are, in fact, engaging in idolatry.

## Who is my mother, my father ... ?

Our foster child Jacob’s biological mother was a heroin user and prostitute, and the identity of his father was unknown. He was removed from his mother not long after he was born because she was unable to care for him. Jacob was then placed into a foster home. His main foster parents were a lesbian couple. Our household, consisting of us (a married couple without children), two single women (who just so happened to be sisters), a gay-oriented man, and a dog called Ruby all became Jacob’s other foster parents. We provided respite care for Jacob when his main foster moms needed a break. In Jacob’s little three-year-old world, “family” in the traditional or nuclear sense simply didn’t exist, or even make sense. Who, or what, was family for Jacob? Real stories like Jacob’s force us to reconsider just what family is.

Janet Fishburn, mentioned above, in her book *Confronting the Idolatry of Family: A New Vision for the Household of God*, rightly asserts,

> Where a domesticated piety dominates, or where the concerns of the nuclear family become the focus of a church, the conservation of middle-class ideals can blind both leaders and people to the prominent concern for social justice found in the Bible. And even when leaders are committed to seeking social justice, they have not been able to sustain a legitimate critique of poverty and injustice in America because the family ideals of the American Dream continue to be linked to democratic values and economic stability. Uncritical loyalty to “the family pew” makes it very difficult to see or comprehend the plight of the poor and the homeless and the oppression of minority persons, as anything but their own fault.

She then goes on to say that it requires courage for any pastor of a mainstream congregation to preach prophetically. “To ask middle-class Americans to see American culture as Jesus would see it is to ask them to vote against their own privileged position in society.”

Now, please understand us: we say all of this not to further attack the family and erode its still-positive influence on society, but rather to reclaim it by giving it a broader definition. We want to refocus it by putting it in its proper context—the family of God.

As Rodney Clapp states it, “The family as a narrow social unit is not God’s most important institution on earth—rather the church is the First Family. The family is not the social agent that most significantly shapes and forms the character of Christians. The family is not the primary vehicle of God’s grace and salvation for a waiting, desperate world.” Rather, the church is God’s agent commissioned to fulfill these functions. Even a brief reading of Ephesians makes this abundantly clear. “Restoring and redeeming the family, then, does not begin with the nation or with the family itself. It begins with the Church.”

The perfect family, if there is such a thing, is not an idealized nuclear unit of consumption, but an inclusive, warm, inviting environment where people can get a glimpse of true community, and therefore of heaven. In contrast to the narrower perspective of the nuclear family, the Bible has a much larger vision that incorporates the nuclear unit but goes well beyond it to include grandparents, cousins, friends, servants, and the stranger.

This is no family first approach as we now conceive it. Rather, for disciples, it must be Jesus first and all things in relation to him. “Only by seeing Jesus and all that he means can we begin to build ... families that serve the one and final reality which we call the Kingdom of God.” Jesus, following the logic of Shema spirituality, radically redefines all our loyalties, including those of family relations, around himself; our love for parents may even appear to be hostility in comparison with our love for him.

> Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household. Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. (Matt. 10:34–37)

Jesus is once again challenging our natural loyalties and claiming right of rule. And he totally redefines family around the community of disciples.

> He replied to him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” Pointing to his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” (Matt. 12:48–50)

Fishburn is absolutely right when she says, “If love of family is stronger and deeper than love for Jesus Christ, this is family idolatry.”

## The Church as the Family of God

Nelson Mandela, in his autobiography *Long Walk to Freedom*, exposes the reader to a concept of family much closer to that of the biblical world. He says that when he visits another village or city, he need not call ahead to let them know that he is coming because when he arrives everyone is his mother, uncle, sister. It is this wider understanding that we must apply to the church as the household or family of God in order to understand it correctly. The nuclear family idea simply will not do. Think about it: if God’s family were a nuclear family as we define it, none of us would be included! Only the “insider members” would be included. It probably wouldn’t go much further than the inner relations of the Trinity. If it did manage to include humans, then perhaps the nation of Israel would be included, leaving everyone else as outsiders. But we know that is not the case in the New Testament. All the redeemed are together, co-heirs with Christ, adopted into the family with full membership privileges (Rom. 8:13–18; Gal. 4:4–6; Eph. 2:11–22), thus making God’s family a massive, culturally diverse collection of plain, beautiful, dumb, brilliant, weird, and wonderful people—God’s own redeemed freak collection! While missionally we need to live incarnationally among a distinctive group of people, theologically we need to see the church as a very big, massively extended family. The two aspects ought to be held in creative tension.

The big household of God can only be realized if we deal with our fear of the other and truly value diversity. But, frankly, most churches are anything but diverse! We do tend to look the same, think the same, and behave in the same way. As we say in the preceding chapter on the church, we tend to be fearful of the other, and yet this encounter with people unlike us is exactly what we need, for we learn more through differences than we do by similarities.

## The Home Is an Extension of the Heart

Again we ask, Why is it that so many Christian households remain firmly shut to the outsider? Why is it that we find it so hard to open up our homes? Most of us will serve at the church, give some money to the poor, and perhaps even go out on mission trips, but when it comes down to bringing that mission “home,” we flatly refuse. More than that, we see it as our personal space that ought not be intruded upon. After all, isn’t the home the domain of the family? And isn’t my family the safe haven for those I am responsible for?

Perhaps we can alter the equation: perhaps we need to see the church as modeling a “home.” For us, church was always meant to be an extension of the home. So when we first started at South, one of the first things we did with the chapel area was totally refurnish it. We put in carpets, couches, beanbags, pop art, lamps, and the types of things one may normally have in their living room. The chapel, previously somewhat uninviting, was converted from a “religious space” to a place where people could feel as comfortable as they might in their family rooms at home. Too many churches create artificial, neat, “nice” environments, almost like a perfect display home. The same applies even more to high church architecture. They are not particularly human environments—try sitting on the pews! People can never feel at home or naturally free in cold and impersonal environments. Architecture certainly does communicate! Compare a cozy local restaurant with a not-so-cozy local McDonalds—the one communicates “eat and stay,” the other, “eat and get out.” We believe that how we design and decorate our church buildings often gives insight into how we want our congregation members to appear—neat and tidy, and definitely with no messy behavior!

Interestingly, the home (*oikos*) was in fact the primary model and place of meeting for the church of the New Testament. They had no dedicated “religious” church buildings. Homes then functioned very differently, operating as they did under a different idea of the family. For one, they included extended family, friends, guests, and servants. Most would therefore house around twenty-plus people. But we must also remember that (since they had no TV) after work everyone would hang out in the courtyard or dining area, which was obviously very large. They would eat, chat, drink, and generally be together until late at night before going to sleep.

As you can see in the diagram below, these houses were situated along a street. Various houses in the neighborhood would take turns offering hospitality to others along the street. It was a dynamic social system. Viewed this way, a house in the Greco-Roman world operated more like a local café or pub would in ours—it was what we would call a classic third place, not a first place as we define it. It was into this complex and rich relational environment that the gospel was introduced, and in which the church took root in the ancient world.

Now, we are not saying the church should be limited to our houses! Given the prevailingly narrow understanding of family, this could prove missionally disastrous because the church in a nuclear-family house can (and often does) become even more closed than the more institutional forms! So please don’t misunderstand us here. What we are saying is that we certainly can become more “homely” in our churches, and we can certainly learn from the complex and open relational structure that was created through bringing the church home, so to speak. Actually, we think that the third place, and not necessarily the home, provides us with the richest social context for engaging in mission in the West.

## Eating Our Way into the Kingdom

One of the most significant ways in which we can start changing our world is by practicing simple kindness and hospitality. We remember clearly when our friend Nick Wight (a missionary and former pastor of Matthew’s Party, our first church plant) suggested that if every Christian household regularly invited a stranger, or a poor person, or a work colleague into their home for a meal with the family once a week, we would literally change the world by eating! At first we thought that this was an overstatement, but upon reflection we actually believe it is true.

For instance, we have experienced missional generosity with our friends, the Graf family. Phil, Laina, and the kids are missionaries in Europe and totally get the power and grace of hospitality. They believe part of the reason people don’t open up their homes is because they have yet to understand the kingdom value of hospitality—we agree and believe we all need to learn from people like them. Following her belief in the power of hospitality, Laina actually tattooed a large Celtic cross, facing outward, on the inside of both her arms. When we queried her about the unusual placement of these beautiful tattoos, she said that it reminds her that when she is serving a dish (the tattoos are presented to the person she is serving) it shows them that Jesus is serving them through her. For the whole Graf family, their home is not their haven but rather a sort of welcoming inn, gracing all who come through their door. The home and family are without question a reflection of what a real kingdom family can look like. They do not have a locked-door mentality but rather an open-door policy which, to our thinking, correlates to an open-heart mentality. Closed door, closed heart; open door, open heart—the home is an extension of the heart. Isn’t this what communion is all about?

## Implications for Housing

The call to be hospitable people, to welcome strangers (and even perhaps angels), must reach beyond table fellowship and impact how and where we live.

Sharing a home allows the community in that house to share common life around Jesus. Not only does it mean exposing one’s life to the accountability of other disciples (something essential to authentic discipleship), but it also allows all to develop common disciplines and rhythms, such as community meals, corporate prayer and reading of Scripture, hospitality, service, and so on. There is a great synergy in simple community and it provides a real-life opportunity to learn how to love. In many ways, it gives us an opportunity to experience what the Bible means by *oikos*, or the household—the basic unit of “church” in the New Testament.

We have always believed in both the power and necessity of community for discipleship, ministry, and mission. Except for two months when we first got married, we have never had a time when we did not have people living with us! Our church was a community, and was made up of many different community houses stuffed full of Jesus freaks. We have also questioned our personal right to private ownership in the way that is assumed by Westerners. As a result, we decided to buy a house with a five-party ownership. Actually, it is a great, one-hundred-year-old house, but because of its location (in our red-light district), we got it for a bargain. And besides, with our rather financially deprived community, most of us could never afford to buy a house like that on our own—it made much more economic sense to buy together. Living there has been a wonderful, missional, fun-loving experience of extended family—church as we describe it above.

## A Message Tribe

In this chapter, we have focused primarily on the way in which we reconfigure and live out what it means to be the family of God. This is by no means the last word on what it means to be a missional church. A thorough rethinking here is likely to open us up to significant new missional possibilities and new ways in which to live out what it means to walk in the untamed way of Jesus. If how we think of God and self profoundly affects the nature of discipleship and mission, then the same is true for the church. Distorted perspectives of the church damage our witness and our capacity to live out its message. The church is, in the end, a “message-tribe,” a community with a mission that only it can fulfill. If we limit our view of the church to that of the one-dimensional, attenuated nuclear family, we will violate something fundamental to a genuinely missional understanding of the church and damage our witness.

We agree with Rodney Clapp when he says that witnessing means incarnating the church in peculiar shapes and through rich practices that can only be explained by resorting to the story of Israel and Jesus Christ. When we see ourselves in the light of the biblical narrative, forsaking false cultural definitions of ourselves, we can see the redemptive impulse of God reaching out through his people into a lost and broken world. We cannot but open up our hearts, our lives, and our homes, and so actively participate in what God is doing in the world.

> Through followers of Jesus like yourselves gathered in churches, this extraordinary plan of God is becoming known and talked about even among the angels! (Eph. 3:10 Message)

## Practices

- **Mi casa es tu casa (my home is your home):** Take the risk of opening up your lives to others. Do so with open hearts, but also with wisdom. Start slowly: perhaps a day per week, perhaps extending as the family adjusts. Or you can take in an overseas student as a renter. The task is to allow the home to become a haven for more than just the nuclear family. Think seriously about fostering a child or doing some relief work for those who do foster care.

- **Practice regular hospitality:** Try this—commit to table fellowship beyond the nuclear family three times a week: one time with people inside the community of faith, one time with people outside the church, and one spare.

- **Do a social audit of your relationships:** How many of the people in your circle are of the same socio-political and economic profile as you? To open yourselves up to the diversity of God’s family, you might need to “adopt a few freaks”—people unlike you and your current social circle.

## Group Discussion

- How has the narrowing of the idea of the family changed our view of the church?
- Conversely, how would broadening our understanding of the family change how you see yourselves and what you do?
- The renewal of the family will not start with focusing on the family as a unit of society; it will start with the church as God’s redeemed family. Do you agree?
- How have you moved from being a “Jesus freak” to being a “control freak,” and why?
