# Too Sexy for the Church?

A number of years ago, Alan conducted a wedding ceremony during which he mentioned the connection between God and orgasms. He invited people to think about getting to know the amazing Person who can invent things like the orgasm—appropriate, we thought, given the context of a marriage. As expected, it created quite a buzz among some of the listeners. Strangely enough, it was the Christians who had more trouble with it than the non-Christians. It seems they had never made the connection, let alone mentioned the words “God” and “orgasms” in the same sentence. For the non-Christians present, it was quite a hit; as a result we were engaged in very interesting conversations about spirituality for the rest of the night. We are not being flippant here. Think about it: if God didn’t create the orgasm, then who did? The devil? Surely not! And if we can’t even seem to bring the two words together, then what does that say about our view of God, creation, redemption, and, in the end, our witness in a sexually broken world?

That many of us continue to struggle with even talking about sexuality should be of concern. Historically, this issue perhaps more than most has both intrigued and confounded us; given the surging and insistent nature of sexuality, this is no surprise. But not talking about it hasn’t helped our case at all—many Christian young people still rely predominantly on sources other than the church to learn about their sexuality.

Much needs to be said about human sexuality—far more than can be expressed in one simple chapter—and, in fact, this will be the subject of Deb’s next book. What we hope to do here is to raise issues as they relate to both our discipleship and our mission. With these qualifications, let’s proceed.

We find it amusing that while some of God’s people tend to be ignorant, anxious, and even embarrassed about all things sexual, God clearly is not. Not only is he the creator and designer of sexuality, but he also doesn’t mind documenting some pretty risqué stories in Scripture.

For instance, Jonathan Kirsch starts his book *Harlot by the Side of the Road* by noting,

> The stories you are about to read are some of the most violent and sexually explicit in all of Western literature. They are tales of human passion in all of its infinite variety: adultery, seduction, incest, rape, mutilation, assassination, torture, sacrifice, and murder. And yet every one of these stories is drawn directly from the pages of the Holy Bible.

Kirsch then proceeds to give a commentary on seven stories from the Old Testament chosen for their particularly scandalous content. These narratives have, over time, been deliberately passed over, toned down, or even outright banned by a church incapable of integrating them into its worldview. Why, he rightly asks, if they are part of our Bible, do we tend to dodge them so? Good question.

While Kirsch does not profess to be a disciple of Jesus, he has raised the profile of the Bible in a way that many Christians fail to do, for he is not afraid to make public all the “naughty” bits we prefer to avoid. The reality is that those same naughty bits can offer great hope to those who have walked similar roads. By describing the failings of the biblical saints, it serves to normalize sexual brokenness as part of the yet-to-be-redeemed human condition. For instance, when the great King David not only commits adultery but also lies and murders in order to soothe his desire, then no matter what we might have done, God’s forgiveness, love, and grace can be experienced by all.

## I’m Too Sexy for the Church

The church has had a hard time reconciling sexuality as an aspect of Christian experience. Some very spiritual people have seriously misread the creational purposes of God in this regard and, as a result, have produced a harmful legacy for those who inherited their defective theology.

God created humans as sexual beings; in Scripture and in human experience, spirituality and sexuality are linked at a very deep level. To embrace one significant aspect of our humanity at the expense of the other must inevitably cause problems. Like it or not, we are very much spiritual and very much sexual. Failure to integrate these can cause us to live a fragmented life that operates at two irreconcilable levels: a disembodied spirituality that floats at least two inches above the earth and a suppressed bodily sexuality that will inevitably seek to express itself in dark ways.

It’s as though we believe our sexuality directly opposes our spirituality and that the more sexual we are, the less spiritual we must be. Or the reverse can also be true: the more spiritual we become, the less sexual we are. While neither of these is true, one can certainly overcome sexual problems by deepening one’s spirituality. Our experience working with sexual addicts provides adequate testimony to this reality. We have observed many times dramatic decreases in sexually “acting out” when an individual grew in the ways of the Shema—in loving God and others. Relationships were the key; loving and being loved is what they really needed. As with most addictions, the presenting issue is just a symptom; the real issues are of the heart.

One does not have to be a driven sex addict to live the dualistic, segmented existence described above. Most people struggle to integrate the two. But because of Christianity’s historic suspicion that pleasure (especially sexual) is somehow “of the devil,” Christians generally tend to get this aspect of their lives, at least to some degree or another, wrong.

## Take a Cold Shower, Origen!

Most of our problems related to sexuality and spirituality come from the incursion of a false, unbiblical dualism into our sense of what it means to be a human and disciples of Jesus. Essentially, dualism stems from the mistaken belief that humans have two basic natures, the physical and the spiritual, or the body and the mind, and that these two are in irreconcilable conflict with each other. All pleasures (especially sexual ones) originate from the body and are therefore viewed as fundamentally evil because they take us away from God. As a result, the disciple has to suppress all sexual urges to be a truly spiritual person.

This form of bodily dualism was introduced in Christianity very early on as Christianity moved out of the more holistic (non-dualistic) worldview of the Hebrews to the essentially dualistic worldview of the Greeks—we need look no further than some of the early church fathers to see this. A good example is the brilliant philosopher-theologian Origen. He was famous for helping guide the church theologically, but one of his more renowned actions was that he castrated himself because he believed his sexuality contradicted his love for God. In Origen’s mind, something had to go! Thankfully he chose the sexual part, because he was needed by the church of his day. But you would agree that it was a pretty extreme measure. In his hilarious book *The Year of Living Biblically*, A. J. Jacobs comments,

> Origen is said to have interpreted literally Matthew 9:12 ... and castrated himself. Origen later became a preeminent theologian of his age—and an advocate of figurative interpretation (italics ours).

A bit late for his offending organs, perhaps, and no doubt brought about by the realization that sexuality could not be taken out by the removal of his testicles, Origen and others like him tragically found that castration fails to eradicate the issue of sexuality; sex is more than simply what we do with our genitals. It has deep connections with our psyche as well as our spirituality.

Then there was Augustine, a fifth-century theologian whose thinking has profoundly influenced Christianity. He was a great man, but because he struggled with dualism and a strong sex drive he also became well known for his highly conflicted views about sexuality. He stated (rightly) that the act of sex was acceptable only within the context of marriage and (wrongly) for the sole purpose of procreation. He also taught that any pleasure associated with the act of intercourse was to be rejected as evil. In fact, he went on to teach that original sin was actually passed on to the child in the physical act of sex itself. So, folks, you can have sex if your purpose is purely to have babies. But you had better focus on the cross while you are doing it, because if you happen to enjoy it at all, you are sinning and damaging your child! It took us a good fifteen hundred years to get over the bad guilt trip Augustine introduced into Western culture. Theology has consequences.

It gets far more bizarre than that! Enter the so-called desert fathers. These guys were without doubt the spiritual heroes of their day. What they did to their bodies would be absolutely hilarious if they weren’t so sincere and the effects so tragic. They sought to resolve their issues with sexual temptation by taking seriously extreme measures. One guy, suffering sexual temptation, went out naked into the desert to be bitten by mosquitoes. It was his way of dealing with the temptations and evils of the flesh. He didn’t come back that night. When some of the brothers went to find him, they discovered a blubbering blob of humanity nearly bitten to death by the bugs. He barely survived. Others like Simon Stylites resorted to living on top of a pole for forty years—far from the reach of women. Fired by dualism, the desert fathers reviled and mistreated their bodies, loathed their all-too-human lives, and saw salvation as a final relief from the passions associated with the body. While these people were utterly sincere, spiritual people, they rejected the sexual and other bodily dimensions, thus severing humanity from its source of meaning in relation to God (see Figure 1 below). From these examples, we can see that the church’s theological conflict in relation to sex has to do with the splitting in two of the spiritual and the physical.

It’s high time we got over dualism! This unbiblical concept not only distorts our understanding of humanity, but also creates a false distinction between sacred and secular, work and play, religious experiences and ordinary social experiences, spirituality and sexuality. It is profoundly suppressing and antihuman. And it still informs much of the church’s thinking, as, for instance, in the Catholic doctrine of the celibacy of the clergy.

But how can this be? Clearly our bodies are a gift of creation (Genesis 1–3), and their associated passions are elemental forces out of which arise many great human works, the holy included. Martin Buber is absolutely right when he says, “Of all the works of creation, it is passion which is the very good, without which man cannot serve God, or truly live.”

To which Heschel adds,

> God is not only the creator of earth and heaven. He is also the One who created delight and joy. Even lowly merriment originates in holiness. The fire of evil can better be fought with flames of holy ecstasy than through fasting and mortification.

Suppressing our basic humanity is the counsel of despair. The answer lies rather in redeeming and directing our passions. For disciples, the answer must be found in rejecting dualism and attempting to integrate our lives by bringing the whole of life, sex included, under the sovereignty of God.

There is no doubt in our minds that the link between sexuality and spirituality is a sacred one. As Paul Jewett says, “Our sexuality is a quality of being that penetrates the deepest ground of our humanity.” Karl Barth maintained that the way we reflect our Creator, the way we are like God most precisely, is in our sexuality. Theologian Stanley Grenz, among others, also hints at this when he talks about human sexuality being the basis for the human drive toward bonding, as it relates to the defined goal of establishing community among humans and between humans and God. Like the imago Dei, no matter how damaged it is, our sexuality is still a primary part of us. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke says,

> Human experience lies so incredibly close to that of sex, to its pain and its ecstasy, that the two manifestations are indeed but different forms of one and the same yearning and delight.

## Kissin’ Cousins

Before we more fully explore the connections between our spirituality and sexuality, it might be helpful at this point to suggest a working definition for both.

- **Sexuality** is the deep desire that drives us beyond ourselves in an attempt to connect with, to understand, that which is other than ourselves. Essentially, it is a longing to know and be known by other people (on physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual levels).
- **Spirituality** is a vast longing that drives us beyond ourselves in an attempt to connect with, to probe, and to understand our world. Beyond that, it is the inner compulsion to connect with the Eternal Other that is God. Essentially, it is a longing to know and be known by God (on physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual levels).

God understands we are both spiritual and sexual, for he made us that way. To deny one or the other is to deny integral parts of our humanity. And to keep them compartmentalized within us is to remain fragmented. In this light, spirituality can be seen as a vertical longing and sexuality as a horizontal longing.

```

Viewed this way, we see that spirituality and sexuality are indeed very similar: both involve searching for connection, one for the Divine, one for the human. Our deepest longings as humans are to be in relationship with both God and our neighbor—this really and simply is the human condition. We can see why some have called these two dimensions “kissing cousins.”

A few years ago we decided to set up a stall at SEXPO, the massive, annual sexuality exhibition in our city put on by the porn industry. The purpose in doing this was to be a living presence of Jesus in dark places and to generate discussion around sexuality and spirituality.

The name of the stall we set up was called “Heavenly Orgasms”—not the best name, but provocative enough to attract attention. Well, it worked! Most people that passed by commented on the name and asked what it meant. As you can imagine, conversations ranged far and wide, and we were able to share the gospel with a number of people.

Is there anywhere God is not?

And if he is there, can’t we join him? For us this has meant that we’ve joined God in some pretty strange, dark, and even dangerous places.

And remember that the Hebrew word *yada* (to know) is used for both our relationship with God as well as for sexual intercourse. In the Bible, intimacy (time, belonging, and commitment) is required for both of these relationships to function as they are meant to.

Weird, but true!

Clearly, then, sex isn’t just about sex. Writer Christopher West is right when he says, “The way we understand and express our sexuality points to our deepest held convictions about who we are, who God is, the meaning of love, the ordering of society, and even the ordering of the universe.” Therefore, the more integrated we become in these, the more whole we will become. Wholeness will not come through a suppression of one’s sexuality; that would be to deny a vital aspect of our humanity.

Rather, our sexuality must always be seen as not only integral to who we are as humans, but as part of the intended created order. It is a gift from God—not some seedy idea of the devil that came after the fall, as some, such as the church fathers mentioned above, have been tempted to think.

Something is still missing. To our two definitions above, we need to add one more to make sense of it. We need to see how this all relates to discipleship. Let's see what happens when we add this definition to the equation.

- **Discipleship** involves knowing and being known by God through Jesus and living our lives in the kingdom of God. As followers of Jesus, we are not called to a vague and undefined spirituality but to a spirituality that exists within the context of discipleship.

Discipleship, the lifelong process of becoming more and more like Jesus, will therefore require offering all that we are to our Lord. This involves striving in the power of the Holy Spirit to gather our drives and passions and directing them toward God in worship. Sex is sacred, but not to be used for idolatry. Remember, biblical spirituality involves the extension of Jesus’s kingship over all spheres of life. The body is a temple, not an amusement park. When we bring all these together, it looks something like Figure 2 (compare with Figure 1 above).

Integrating sexuality requires moving beyond an undefined notion of spirituality to that of following Jesus in the task of discipleship. Once again, we touch on the spirituality of the Shema, where we are instructed to love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength (spirituality) and to love others as we love ourselves (which must involve all loves, including our sexuality).

## The Loathsome Toy

In *The Great Divorce*, C. S. Lewis tells a great allegorical story about a ghost of a man afflicted by lust. Lust is represented by a red lizard that sits on the shoulder of the man and whispers convincingly into his ear. The man eventually begins to despair about the lizard, at which point an angel offers to kill it for him. But the man is torn about what to do. He fears the death of lust will kill him; he makes excuse after excuse to the angel to keep the lizard. But finally the man allows the angel to seize and kill the lizard. The angel grasps the reptile, breaks its neck, and throws it to the ground. This ghostly man is gloriously transformed into a real and solid being while the lizard, rather than dying, is turned into a powerful white stallion. Weeping with tears of joy, the man jumps onto the horse and they fly to the heavens. What Lewis is saying here is that eros (and in this case, lust), redeemed and directed, becomes holy passion and will take us to God.

When we fail to integrate our lives under God, sexuality becomes a dangerously isolated part of our nature—unsanctified, yet potent. And when so strong a force as sexuality is left to itself, it invites the darkness. Unredeemed, it becomes a major problem for followers of Jesus in a world dominated by sexual imagery and impulses. Listen to the universal male struggle as expressed by novelist Frederick Buechner:

> Lust is the ape that gibbers in our loins  
> Tame him as we will by day  
> He rages all the wilder by night  
> And there is no river in the world that flows cold and strong enough to strike him down  
> Almighty God, Why dost Thou deck men out with such a loathsome toy?

A loathsome toy indeed! Author Robert Hicks says that without a proper understanding of their sexuality, “men will carry around in their psyches a spiritual God-hunger so mysterious and powerful that when it is driven underground, it will seek spiritual fulfillment only in the secrecy of hotel rooms, nightclubs, and endless secret affairs.”

So what about women? Without wanting to generalize or point out the obvious, men and women will express their sexuality in similar but also different ways. Male sexuality, as evidenced above, will tend to express itself in more “genital” ways, and female sexuality in more “social” ways, including insecurity, emotional over-attachments, inappropriate interest in other people’s affairs, and promiscuity, among other things. We recognize not all men or women fit neatly into these obvious stereotypes, but stereotypes exist for a reason.

A good example that highlights the differences between men and women is the magazines we purchase. The top-selling men’s magazines are listed in the category of “soft porn”—*Playboy*, *Ralph*, *Maxim*, and the like. The highest selling women’s magazines are *Who Weekly*, *Woman’s Day*, and so on. One is more about genital sexual interest and the other social sexual interest. We would include all these magazines in the pornographic category. If male porn has to do with looking at people’s private parts, the female version has to do with looking at people’s private lives. We call this “social pornography.” It fills women’s gossip magazines and does enormous damage to the women addicted to them.

We can’t count the number of young women we have ministered to over the years who were damaged by the “beauty myth” promoted through these magazines (nevermind the gossip, unhealthy interest in people’s lives, and addiction to the celebrity cult). When we set up certain people as the “beautiful people,” and their lifestyles as the glamorous way to live, we set up an unattainable standard. The problem with standards of beauty is that they imply standards of ugliness.

And let’s be honest, how many of us really look like that? Moreover, the gossip these magazines engender is seriously disturbing. We ought not be poking around in people’s lives without being invited. By doing so, we assume a certain false intimacy that shortcuts real friendships, just like male pornography shortcuts a healthy sexual expression.

As far as the Bible is concerned, prurient interest in both is out of bounds for the disciple. If women insist on men not looking at *Penthouse*, we suggest that women might want to give up on *People* magazine as well. Either way, unredeemed male and female sexuality is a major cause of human brokenness and a major reason why many walk away from following Jesus.

The spiritual power in sexuality is extremely strong. It is interesting that all sexual compulsions seem to have a religious air about them. They are profoundly ritualized, and ritual is the mark of worship. Sexual addictions and aberrations can easily become our expressions of worship—to a false god. Our sexual problems only reveal how desperate we are to express, even in some perverted form, the deep compulsion to worship God.

## When Agony Meets Ecstasy

When people fail to redeem and redirect their sexuality toward the holy, when it is isolated from the Shema’s challenge to love God with body, soul, will, and spirit, then it will take us where we don’t really want to go, and it will become a “loathsome toy.” Left unredeemed, and without the moral and spiritual restraints that come with following Jesus, the full-blown spiritual power of sexuality becomes an enslaving idol and will almost definitely become extremely harmful to both men and women.

In Shema spirituality, as we have seen, the task is not to suppress our humanity with its pleasures and drives. On the contrary, we are to direct our passions in such a way that, without losing their force, they cease to be evil. The way to do this is to reorient them toward God in holiness. This reorienting of life, or “hallowing”—making holy—transforms the urges by confronting them with holiness and making them responsible to what is holy. “Transforming the evil passion into good,” Buber writes, cannot take place inside oneself, but only in relation [to God and others]. What Buber is saying here is that salvation is not simply a private affair of the soul; it involves responsibly relating to God and people—hence, the Shema. If C. S. Lewis was right in saying that all our sins are virtues gone wrong, our task is to redirect them to God in the power of the Holy Spirit.

If we really believe God is Creator and Lord of all, there can be no realm of life that cannot be redeemed if we are to be authentic lovers of God. There is no sacred and secular if God claims all. And redemption is not simply a private affair of the soul but must include our involvement in the world through active engagement with God and others in every arena of life. God demands that we offer all to him as an act of love and worship. Holiness in the Scriptures has less to do with opposing or denying daily human experiences than actively redeeming them by directing them toward God. C. S. Lewis rightly taught, “There is but one good; that is God. Everything else is good when it looks to Him and bad when it turns from Him.” Besides, we have found the only way to overcome an enslaving passion for bad things is to have a greater passion for that which is good. For instance, we suggest lust is essentially the love of beauty divorced from the love of goodness.

What, then, do we do with those passions—especially our sexuality—that have terrible power to enslave us, ruin relationships, and damage society? As disciples, we must, as an act of worship, learn how to direct them toward God. Our passions are part of our humanity, and passion is only evil when it remains directionless, when it will not accept the way that leads us toward God.

## You’re Too Sexy for My Church

We have a friend who refers to himself as “the harlot by the side of the road.” He is a gay man who has been HIV-positive for almost twenty years. He deeply loves Jesus and because of that has struggled with his sexuality for as long as he can remember. The path of discipleship has never been an easy one for him, partly because of his struggle but also because the church has not really known what to do with him. Much of his journey is walked alone, and much of his struggle is known only to him and God. Our friend is not alone; there are many people out there who feel like harlots by the side of the road and who would never dare to become part of a living community of faith because of the guilt, shame, or even stigma they carry.

Although the sad reality is that our friend is “too sexy” for many of our churches, some communities of faith are becoming much more intentional about breaking down the stigma that so often attaches to people who struggle with their sexuality. We recently saw the movie *Milk*, in which Sean Penn portrays Harvey Milk, a gay political activist. The movie is based on the true story of Milk’s life and eventual assassination. It is set in San Francisco in the politically tumultuous seventies and portrays a very ugly side of the church, with Anita Bryant leading the charge against gay people—all in the name of God! We thank God that we as a church have come a long way since those days, but are conscious that we still have a long way to go.

The reality of this is seen in the research, mentioned in an earlier chapter, by David Kinnaman and Gabe Lyons in their book *unChristian*. They looked into what “outsiders” thought of people in the church, and reveal that 91 percent of the people surveyed, people aged between sixteen and twenty-nine, stated that their prime perception of the church was that it was “anti-homosexual” and attacked gay people incessantly. These are staggering statistics. How did we find ourselves in a place where the primary thing “outsiders” can say of us is that we are anti-gay? Not that we are amazingly graceful, loving, or compassionate people, but that we hate homosexuals! This is truly remarkable when you consider that the One we follow doesn’t mention homosexuality, not even once! The second and third most prominent descriptions of Christians made by outsiders were that they are judgmental (87 percent) and hypocritical (85 percent).

Our dear friend Mark, a psychologist who specializes in AIDS and sex education, has a mantra: “Ignorance breeds fear, and fear breeds judgment.” This dictum, that we fear what we do not understand and judge that which we fear, certainly seems to be the case with a lot of Christians regarding the issue of homosexuality. In fact, Christians tend to fear all things sexual, which can cause us to be judgmental toward others in issues relating to sex and sexuality—even though we ourselves have not generally lived up to the biblical standard. Hence, Kinnaman’s statistics ring true!

## Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall ...

It is glaringly obvious to us that what is at work here is the biblical principle “judge not, or you will be judged, and at least in the same measure by which you judge” (Matt. 7:1–2). If we were to be really honest with ourselves, most of us have, for years, feared, judged, and actively persecuted this particular community. Remember, for many non-Christians the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of Christians is “anti-homosexual.” This has enormous implications for the church as we seek to do mission, particularly among those between the ages of sixteen and twenty-nine, let alone among the gay community itself.

Our judgments have boomeranged back on us—it was bound to happen, for we were explicitly warned by Jesus about this. Now, whether we want it or not, an issue that perhaps wasn’t even on our radar has foisted itself upon us, because we are all painted with the same brush—we are all seen as unChristian! Our very reputations as Christians are now tied in with a people group most of us at best tolerate and at worst have outright contempt for.

Key missiologist Ed Stetzer rightly notes that based on the church’s treatment of homosexuals alone, there will be increasingly more people that will simply not give you and your church a hearing. If we are perceived to be ungracious in our attitudes and responses to gay people, we will effectively be foreclosing on meaningful conversations with many. The issue is not what we ourselves believe about human sexuality, but rather how we treat those with differing perspectives on sexuality. The issue is our flagrant lack of mercy and compassion—the very things we so gratefully claim for ourselves. This bears false witness to what we stand for—that we are all sinners who have freely received grace and forgiveness. Why can we not offer it in return? We should pay attention to Jesus’s warning about lack of grace (for instance, in Matt. 18:23–35).

Jesus explicitly warns his followers to be very careful of the “yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy” (Luke 12:1). Pharisees (ancient and modern) live inauthentically: their lives do not match their beliefs. As a result, they are dishonest and hide behind religion. The “pharisization” of Christian discipleship is a profoundly treacherous process—it works its way into the believer like yeast through dough. This is partly because of the lure of moralism and the desire to control. We suggest that if one has been a Christian for even a few years, it is absolutely necessary that we read the Gospels with the viewpoint that it is us who are the Pharisees! At the very least, we should admit some real sense of empathy toward them as they are not all that different from us. As Bruxy Cavey says, “Jesus critiques the Jewish religious leaders because they are religious, not because they are Jewish. And if we grab hold of that, we can see how his rebukes are transferable for all religions at all times.”

For instance, they were sincere, loved their Scriptures, believed in the supernatural, were waiting for the Messiah, were decent and morally upright, were zealous, tithed beyond duty, were “missional,” and maintained Israel’s identity and tradition in a time of occupation. In many ways, they were exemplary religious people. It’s not hard to see how they are very much like us! We believe that if we do not read them as ourselves, we miss much of the truth of what Jesus has to say to us, and we will likely commit precisely the same sins that are associated with them. It is a problem every religious person encounters in life. Religious people get very fussy about “things” and then become coercive about it. If we are not careful, we can end up defending truths and at the same time miss Truth—just like the Pharisees. It’s all about how we inhabit our beliefs and how we allow the power of our beliefs to inhabit or mold us.

For some reason, religious people have always picked on sexual sinners. To be honest, it’s hard to know why exactly this is the case. Why single them out for special attention? Perhaps it has to do with the difference between what some have called sins of the spirit and sins of the body. It is much easier to hide the more respectable spiritual sins like greed, hypocrisy, self-righteousness, pride, envy, and so on. The “sexual sinner” is much more vulnerable to the graceless judgments of others because what they do is more obvious.

Darn it—a covetous, self-righteous so-and-so can get into the ministry of the church and never be challenged about his or her sins, but we won’t let those “filthy fags” or “unrighteous fornicators” even come to worship! Yet Jesus dealt very harshly with the former and compassionately with the latter (Matt. 11:19; Luke 7:36–48; John 8:1–11). How can we claim to follow Jesus when we are so unlike him in this regard?

## Who’s the Greatest Sinner of Them All?

Over the years of journeying with people who have struggled with their sexuality, we still continue to be amazed at the way the church tends to focus on sexual sins, which are narrowed down to what we do with our genitals. We neglect other, more “acceptable” sins—for instance, the sin of greed and what we do with our money. How did we get it so backward? To be perfectly honest with you, we’ve come to believe that Jesus cares more about what we do with our money than what we do with our genitals! That doesn’t mean he doesn’t care what we do sexually, as of course he does, but he seems to care a whole lot more about what we do with our money and our knowledge.

Why is it that we have created a sort of hierarchy of sins the way we have, somehow putting sexual sins above most others? Perhaps part of the answer lies in Paul’s teaching about sexual sins in 1 Corinthians 6. What Paul is talking about in this passage is that when we sin sexually, the consequences of our sin will be different to others because we will feel the effects within ourselves. However, Paul never says these sins are worse than others. In fact, he takes great pains to list a whole host of sins in the very same passage (1 Cor. 6:9–10), implying they are all at least equally sinful, lest any of us think we can assume higher ground. Sin is sin is sin.

What is true of course is that different sins will have different consequences. Let’s return again to the comparison between sexual sins and sins of greed. In our estimation, if you were to weigh the consequences of, say, adultery, we would all agree it is a pretty bad sin because its ramifications include betrayal, relational breakdown, impact on families and friends, and loss of personal integrity. Recovery from adultery, including learning to trust again and to forgive, is difficult and may take a long time to work through, perhaps even a lifetime. All in all, pretty serious consequences.

But let’s compare this to the consequences of the sin of greed. Greed, the excessive desire to acquire more (especially material wealth) than one needs or deserves, can play itself out in a host of ways, and not all financial. For instance, greed is one of the major reasons for murder, violence, and all sorts of other crime. But let’s focus on the financial aspect just to prove a point. If avarice involves an excessive desire to acquire or possess more than one needs or deserves, it will not only impact our character and relationships; it will have more far-reaching, even global, implications, including issues of world poverty, abuse of poor people for cheap labor, environmental exploitation, and war. A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1 percent of adults alone owned 40 percent of global assets in the year 2000, and that the richest 10 percent of adults accounted for 85 percent of the world total. The bottom half of the world adult population owned barely 1 percent of global wealth. Now, we may think that one individual being greedy won’t have an impact, but we need to face the reality that if every Christian repented of greed and lived much closer to the simpler ways of Jesus, we alone could probably solve the world’s hunger problem!

Please don’t misunderstand us here. We don’t want to be seen as creating a hierarchy of our own, nor do we want to excuse any sin, but we do want to make the point that as disciples we need to look to Jesus as our reference. Committing to becoming more like Jesus means we must act like he does and do as he says. His priorities must become ours.

## Acceptance Must Precede Repentance

The best example we can find of Jesus’s approach toward someone broken in their sexuality is found in John 8, the story of the woman caught in the act of adultery.

> While He [Jesus] was teaching, the scribes and Pharisees brought in a woman who was caught in the act of adultery, and stood her before Jesus. “This woman was caught in the act of adultery. Moses says in the law that we are to kill such women by stoning. What do you say about it?” This was all set up as a test for Jesus; His answers would give them grounds to accuse Him of crimes against Moses’ law. Jesus bent over and wrote something in the dirt with His finger. They persisted in badgering Jesus, so He stood up straight. “Let the first stone be thrown by the one among you who has not sinned.” Once again Jesus bent down to the ground and resumed writing with His finger. The Pharisees knew they had sinned, so there would be no stones thrown this day. Eventually only Jesus and the woman remained, and Jesus looked up. “Dear woman, where is everyone? Are we alone? Did no one step forward to condemn you?” “Lord, no one has condemned me.” “Well I do not condemn you either; all I ask is that you go and from now on avoid the sins that plague you.” (vv. 3–11 Voice)

This story is a beautiful example of grace and acceptance. Here is a woman caught in the very act of adultery; she was most likely naked in front of a leering crowd, totally humiliated and terrified, knowing her fate lay in the outcome of this encounter between Jesus and the religious leaders. The first thing Jesus does is restore something of her dignity by taking the focus off her and placing it on the crowd. Then, by exposing the hypocrisy of judgmentalism, he effectively levels everybody. In fact, this is a total reversal of what the crowds were expecting—religious people were put in the same category as adulterers! No doubt the woman herself was just as shocked. Jesus does not condone sin, but he knows grace is the answer, not judgment. It turns out that they (and we) are all simply human beings trying to work life out—some doing a better job of it than others.

We believe this story is important, not just because of how Jesus responded to the woman, but because of the order of the components of his response. He restores dignity to her, offers her his grace, and then calls her to repentance. Why? Knowing human need, he knows that the right context for real and lasting repentance is God’s forgiveness, acceptance, and grace. He knows it is God’s kindness that leads us to repentance. But we know that too. Isn’t that exactly how we ourselves have been saved by Jesus? Of course! But if that is the case, why do we seem to get it the other way around? Why do we seem to send the message of acceptance based on repentance and socially suitable behavior? Jesus deliberately changed the order of things in his day, instituting the kingdom values of mercy, grace, and forgiveness over the rules and regulations of the Pharisees. We must do likewise.

Sexuality and spirituality are sacred and go to the heart of who we are as relational beings created in the image of God. Neither can be denied or neglected at the expense of the other without damaging the ecology of discipleship. Sex and worship are part of the way we fulfill the two greatest commandments of loving God and loving others.

As people who have received God’s radical gift of grace, we are called to embody grace and extend it to others, particularly as we live in a broken world. Being called unChristian by non-Christian people has revealed that our treatment of the so-called “sexual sinners” has the character of bearing false witness to the radical nature of God’s grace in Jesus. Disciples must leave the judgment of sins to God, but take seriously our call to model an alternative life that testifies to the gospel by which we ourselves are saved.

## Practices

- **Connecting the dots:** As we have seen, the God of the Bible is the inventor of the orgasm, and he doesn’t shy away from using sexual metaphor to describe the relationship he has with his people. He even describes idolatry as whoring after false gods (Jer. 3:2; Ezek. 23:27; the book of Hosea). Learn to say “God” and “orgasm” in the same sentence!
- **Getting over dualism:** This again is a difficult issue that relates largely to the intangible aspects of worldview. But to become integrated disciples, we simply have to get over the dualism that pervades our thinking and actions. We must constantly exercise the belief that this is all God’s world and pleasure is his design.
- **Develop a theology of beauty:** Start by reading C. S. Lewis’s *Cosmic Trilogy*, particularly the second volume, *Perelandra*. Get a feel for how Lewis can integrate almost inconceivable beauty and pleasure into the love of God. Let him help you redefine your understanding of heaven as a disembodied state. Read this book with friends and discuss it together.
- **Stop the sin of judging:** There is clearly a place for discernment of good and evil in the life of discipleship, but we are forbidden the type of judgment that places us in a false superiority to other people (Matt. 7:1–5). Let’s take Jesus’s advice here with utmost seriousness, because failure to do so poisons the life of faith. Focus on your own issues; do not try to solve other peoples’ without first understanding the role of grace in your own life. Remember always that the measure by which we judge will be the measure by which we are judged, so be very careful. We are all beggars telling other beggars where to get bread.
- **Engage people on the “other side”:** If you know a homosexual person, why don’t you try to have a conversation where you are the main listener seeking to understand their situation? Try not to pass judgment; just listen.

## Group Discussion

- Do you have problems with relating sexuality to spirituality? Why?
- How does discipleship redeem sexuality?
- Discuss the definition of lust as the love of beauty divorced from the love of goodness.
- Why do you think religious people reserve their harshest judgments for sexual sinners and not for other forms of sin?
- How is it possible for a generation to think of Christians as essentially unChristian?
- Would you run a stall at SEXPO, and if not, why not?
