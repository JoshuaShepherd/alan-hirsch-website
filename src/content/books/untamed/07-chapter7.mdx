Numerous stories and movies explore the concept of identity and finding oneself. Movies like *Memento*, *The Lion King*, *The Matrix* trilogy, and *The Chronicles of Narnia* are all structured around this theme. The children’s fantasy *Hook* (starring Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts, and Robin Williams) explores how Peter Banning, who is actually Peter Pan but has forgotten his real identity, is placed in a situation where he simply has to recover his lost self in order to save his children who have been whisked off by the pirate (and Peter Pan’s arch enemy) Captain Hook. Having been unwillingly transported by Tinker Bell to Neverland, at first Banning refuses to believe in Tinker Bell’s perception of him—that he is indeed Peter Pan and that he can fly—and so cannot seem to find the lost powers needed to overcome Hook and save the kids (and Neverland) from the marauding pirates. But eventually, through sheer desperation, and helped along with a kiss from Tinker Bell, he remembers his lost identity, thus activating his powers and winning the day.

This story, and others like them, provides a clue to any search for identity: the idea that when one discovers one’s true identity, not only does it bring authenticity, but it delivers real authority. In *The Matrix*, Neo fulfills his destiny as he embraces his identity. The same is true for the children in Narnia—in that land they are royalty, and only by embracing their regal calling can they play their role in delivering the captive creatures of Narnia.

Nothing could be truer for the disciple—our authenticity, as well as our power, is unleashed when we live out our true identity and calling in Christ. We believe that part of the gracing process inherent in becoming more like Jesus is the increasing discovery of the identity God gives to us in him. So much of the New Testament is dedicated to helping us find ourselves again “in Christ.” Why is so much attention given to this end? Because, quite simply, we were created to. And if we do not find our identity in Jesus, then we will surely find it in something else.

## You Are, Now Be

The Scriptures are full of statements about our identity—who we are in Christ. Scholars call these more descriptive statements of the New Testament *indicatives* because they express our deepest identity and form the basis of the *imperatives* (commands) of Scripture, that is, the calling of living out discipleship in the world. For instance, it doesn’t take the reader of Paul very long to note that the first half of his letters are generally more theological-descriptive (describing who we are in Christ) and the last sections ethical-prescriptive (directing us how to live based on who we are)—for example, compare Romans 1–11 to 12–15, or Ephesians 1–3 to 4–6.

This is very important for us to understand because any attempt to live as a disciple that is not properly founded on a true identity in Jesus will result in deviant religion. But any attempt to simply be a Christian without doing anything beyond will be equally aberrant. Throughout the Bible, a person who is redeemed by God must live a life consistent with the God he or she worships. In simplest terms, being and acting belong together—our identity and our sense of purpose are inextricably linked.

This chapter will focus on the importance of getting the indicatives right: of finding and grounding our identity in Jesus.

## Loving God, Loving Others

According to the best thinking in theology, philosophy, and psychology (at least as far as we can discern), developing a true sense of identity requires two essential directions in relationships: one with God and the other with people. Of the two, the God relationship is absolutely foundational. However, this will require that we activate the deepest and most elusive aspect of our humanity—the spiritual. Our relationships with people, while sometimes also tricky, are generally easier because they tend to be more concrete. We come to know who we are through our relationships with both God and others. We are relational beings by our very nature. Or, as the social sciences would say, we are constituted by our relationships.

As we have pointed out on numerous occasions, how we think about and relate to God determines everything. That of course includes what it means to be a person, and in particular what it means to be a disciple of Jesus. We think Søren Kierkegaard was absolutely right when he claimed that without God there is no possibility of a self, because “we are constituted by the relationship to that which brought us into being.” In the words of a philosopher, he is saying that it is only when we ground ourselves in God that we will be able to form a self. If we avoid this most basic of all relationships, we will be doomed to an existential restlessness that will inevitably lead to deep despair. Augustine said our hearts are restless until they find their rest in God. If this is true for every human being, it is even more so for those being transformed into the image of God in Christ (Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18; Col. 3:9–11). Without this most elemental relationship, we simply cannot develop into the people God intends us to be.

But our relationship to other people is also essential; we need people to be a “person” ourselves. We cannot find or form our identity nor our personality in isolation from one another. Our social interactions play a critical role in identity formation. In other words, we can only really know ourselves in relation to the “other.” Play with us here: we are suggesting that even if you had all the genetics of a human being but were raised by pigs, nurtured by pigs, and lived all your life in the company of pigs, you would not be able to form a human personality in the strictest sense of the word. Language, human contact, symbolic gestures, love (or the lack of it)—all go together to make us who we are. Our person-ality, therefore, can only be formed in relation to other persons. As the poet Rainer Maria Rilke said, we come of age “haphazardly assembled from voices, and fears, and little pleasures.” Those irritating siblings, the sacrificial love of parents, the painful socialization of school, the spiritual community of church, and so forth, are all essential to the formation of a healthy identity.

In a broken world full of less-than-perfect relationships, is it any wonder that most of us struggle with our sense of self? A healthy identity and a basic security in who we are as individuals seems to be hard to come by. In our pastoral experience, journeying with people from all walks of life has helped us conclude that it is quite a feat for any individual to become secure in who they are. From the property developer to the bricklayer, it seems nobody can claim to have a whole, healthy sense of self. Insecurity in who we are, in our capacity to achieve, in our contribution to society, and invariably in our relationships plagues all of us to varying degrees, making us wonder whether we are worthy, capable, lovable, and the like.

M. Scott Peck talks about the fact that the world is full of what he calls “half-adults”—people who, for whatever reason, have never really grown up. We would link this directly to an inability to arrive at a healthy sense of self. The sad tragedy is that who we perceive ourselves to be directly relates to how we behave. That’s why the Scriptural “indicatives” are so important. Paul is at pains to create in us a new identity, knowing that when we embrace who God says we are, it will dramatically alter the way we live our lives. We have seen the truth of this in our own lives as well as in the lives of those in our faith community.

The connection between identity and behavior can’t be denied. If you think of yourself as worthless or ugly or incompetent then, in all likelihood, it will work itself out in your behavior. Deb saw this time and time again, especially when she worked with prisoners. One of her “clients” in particular really believed herself to be unlovable and a bad person. This terrible scripting had been reinforced throughout her whole life until she ended up in prison after committing a number of misdemeanors. As Deb grew in her relationship with this woman, she realized that deep down this woman thought she was a “bad apple” and that was just her lot in life. She had been told this from a very young age by her mother, as well as others around her. As simple as it might sound, in this woman’s mind, bad people did bad things, so she would constantly reoffend and end up back in jail. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. To break this cycle between identity and behavior is no easy feat. But eventually, over a long period of time, through constant encouragement and positive reinforcement and loving relationships, this woman began to realize that she was indeed lovable. She wasn’t a bad person after all, and even if she did do the occasional bad thing (like all of us do!), this didn’t define who she was. Today this woman is no longer in prison; she continues to work on her identity, but she no longer defines herself as “bad,” which has profoundly impacted her behavior. She is quite simply a different person.

In a broken world, without a proper connection to God or wholesome relationships with others, one is bound to get things messed up. The extreme of this can be seen in both the psychopaths and sociopaths within our society. The twin aspects of knowing ourselves before God and knowing ourselves through relationships with other people are precisely what are missing in these types of antisocial personality disorders. A failure in essential relationships can ultimately result in terrible human evil. The lack of being properly loved and nurtured can wreak havoc on one’s own sense of worth, let alone one’s value of other people. You only need to study some of these extreme cases in our society—those individuals who have done incredibly evil things—to know that the lack of these life-giving relationships caused them to have a severely corrupted sense of self and others.

Author Shirley Lynn Scott, in her article “What Makes Serial Killers Tick?” documents some chilling words from some of history’s most famous psychopaths.

> “I’m the most cold-blooded sonofabitch you’ll ever meet,” said Ted Bundy. “I just liked to kill, I wanted to kill.” The hallmark of the psychopath is the inability to recognize others as worthy of compassion. Victims are dehumanized, flattened into worthless objects in the murderer’s mind. John Gacey, never showing an ounce of remorse, called his victims “worthless little queers and punks,” while the “Yorkshire Ripper” Peter Sutcliffe brashly declared that he was “cleaning up the streets” of the human trash.

If identity and self-perception constitute the foundational base we operate from, then we can clearly say these men had a very distorted and twisted view of themselves and others. These more extreme cases only highlight the absolute need for ongoing love and affirming relationships in the formation of a healthy human being.

Consider again the remarkable ecology of biblical spirituality when we look at the dynamics of the Shema. We see just how important the two greatest commandments are. If acknowledged and lived out in our lives, they will bring the much needed corrective for a world full of broken images. Just listen to Jesus again:

> “The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.” (Mark 12:29–31)

As we have seen, the self is formed primarily in relation to God and completed in the act of loving others. These truths are found here in the Shema, and they square with the best current thinking on the healthy formation of the self. Here the God relationship is presented in terms of an absolute commitment to the love (and as we have seen in chapter two, this also implies knowledge) of God. This is the grounding relationship Kierkegaard and others speak of. But we are also called by Jesus to move on to loving other people. This is no small task, as learning to love the way Jesus meant requires sacrifice, service, and commitment—real heart. Only in doing precisely these things will we come into contact with our true selves. In other words, if we simply live the Shema, the greatest of all instructions, we are well on the way to becoming more mature in our identity.

Again, our relationship with Jesus is central to everything. If we fail to conform to him, we must suffer the anxieties inflicted on us from other sources, be they cultural forces, idols, or whatever. It is worth asking here: If God-in-Jesus is not at the defining center of our self-awareness, then who or what is? Pop culture? Our work or professions? The brand or the amount of “stuff” we own? Perhaps it’s the expectations of peers and/or parents? Maybe our sexuality? But these are not sure foundations for healthy formation of identity! At best they are secondary. Human beings learn to live behind many masks and mistakenly think this gives them security. But once it is recognized that the mask is no more than a finite construct, and that underneath the “happy and secure” exterior is only emptiness, then the individual might begin—and it is only a possibility—to take God seriously.

## Loving love

We recognize that loving God and others is foundational to the formation of our identity, but knowing we are loved by God and others is perhaps even more important for us to arrive at healthy selfhood. In our ministry experience, not many of us start from this solid foundational base.

An image that has continued to burn in Deb’s mind is a confession made by one of her clients she worked with at the Salvation Army. Caroline (not her real name) had been hospitalized over a dozen times in thirty days because of self-mutilation, among other things. By this time, Deb had reached a place of physical and emotional exhaustion. Feeling overwhelmed and that she was making little progress with her, Deb arrived once again at the hospital to be by her side. While sitting by her bed, Deb began once again to gently question her and to listen to her heart. It was then, in the midst of great vulnerability, that they shared a special and intimate moment. Caroline confessed to Deb that she regularly hurt herself so that she could go to the hospital, because the nurses “touched” her and were nice to her. In the hospital, she never had to be alone; there was someone around all the time. The sad tragedy is that there are many people like Caroline—unloved, untouched, and needing the affirmation from God and humanity that they are indeed loved and lovable. Tragically, this story is not uncommon; many of Deb’s other clients would reoffend just to go back to prison because life on the outside proved to be too lonely or unstructured. In prison, life was predictable and got attention. Even if it wasn’t always positive, some attention was better than none.

Endless psychological conditions, including behavioral and personality disorders as mentioned above, are the direct result of a failure of loving. John Powell, a priest and author, simply and powerfully stated this many years ago when he said that we all are a product of those who have loved us and those who have failed to love us. For if to love and to be loved is part of what defines our humanity, then to not be loved certainly must have a damaging effect on our sense of self.

## With You I Am Well Pleased

Susan Hope, in her book *Mission-Shaped Spirituality*, comments that the story of Jesus’s baptism, and the Father’s proclamation of love for him at that moment (“You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased” [Luke 3:22]), provides an insight into the importance of the disciple being grounded in the knowledge and assurance of God’s love.

> This is the start of the public ministry, the kick-start to all that follows. And it is kick-started with a word, not about the mission, but about being a son, and being greatly beloved. And not only greatly beloved, but greatly delighted in—“with you I am well pleased”—carrying not so much the meaning, “I’m pleased with you (because you’ve done a good job/obeyed me/you’ve met my demands)” as, “You delight me; I enjoy you; I like what I see.”

We all need that same assurance. It is important that we remember that God loves us unconditionally. The Bible tells us that while we were still sinners, Jesus died for us. He didn’t wait until we cleaned up our lives or stopped sinning, but died for us right in the middle of our mess. We are loved ones, the bride of Christ, the beloved of the Lord. We are Christ’s ones, not because of what we do, but because we are in relationship with him—and nothing can change that. Nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus (Rom. 8:35).

God loves us, but his love is not static. It is active and at times demanding because he requires our all. This compelling love of his pushes us forward into becoming whole persons. Through our very selves, where his image shines forth and where his love can be felt, we experience the humanizing love of God.

But make no mistake, his love is not always comfortable; it is also a fierce, sanctifying love, and it will change us. We come to him with many false selves, and we are in great need of redefinition. Because of this, God has to strip, or “undragon,” us.

There is a powerful scene in C. S. Lewis’s *Voyage of the Dawn Treader* (part of *The Chronicles of Narnia* series) where Eustace, a somewhat selfish and greedy boy, is sleeping on a dragon’s hoard. He is thinking greedy, “dragon-ish” thoughts in his heart and suddenly turns into a dragon himself. Now, in this story a dragon is not only a selfish monster that hoards treasures, but also a profoundly lonely creature because it likes nothing better than to eat anything that comes into its world. After a while, Eustace-turned-dragon begins to experience how lonely it is to be a monster, and finds that because of his dragon-like, antisocial ways he can’t even enjoy his treasure. It all turns sour on him, and he begins to see what kind of person he has been. As the full realization of his nature settles upon him, he begins to weep inconsolably.

Through his tears he sees a huge and awesome lion coming toward him, beckoning him to follow. So great is Eustace’s remorse by this time that he will do anything the great beast asks. The lion leads him to a huge, round well and directs him to undress. Eustace has no clothes, so he realizes that he is being asked to remove his snakelike, scaly skin. He thinks he can easily shed his awful dragon hide. He starts scratching away at his scaly self and soon manages to step out of his dragon skin. But just as he steps into the water, he notices he has yet another dragon skin on underneath. He scratches away at this hide and, stepping out of it, starts again into the water. But again he sees he is still a dragon. He thinks to himself, “Oh dear, how ever many other skins do I have to take off?” He then scratches away for the third time and is horrified to find he has yet another dragon skin on. It is then that the lion says, “You will have to let me undress you.”

Eustace is afraid of the lion’s claws, but he’s so desperate that he surrenders his ugly dragon self and lets the lion “undress” him. The very first tear the lion’s claws make goes so deep that Eustace thinks it has gone right through his heart. It hurts worse than anything he’s ever felt. Then the lion catches hold of him and throws him into the crystal clear pool. Hurting terribly at first, Eustace the Dragon sinks deep into the delicious waters until, surfacing, he finds himself turned back into a boy.

Few if any write better of our need to be undragoned than Lewis. In the case of Eustace, Lewis saw with terrible clarity that conversion from loving self to loving God and our neighbors is a radical one indeed. According to Christian doctrine, the sinful and false self must be destroyed by a force beyond itself because it does not have the power to lift itself out of its own narrow interests. Yet when the sinful self is broken and the real self is brought to the surface, the consequence is a new life of transformation and discipleship.

At the very beginning of following Jesus, we are all called to be undragoned by repenting, dying to our fallen selves, and surrendering our identities and purposes to the lordship of Jesus. When we forget this need for repentance, it always comes back to haunt us. We’ve experienced this personally and witnessed it in those we minister to. If people, when coming to Christ, are not discipled in such a way as to challenge the false views they bring to faith (1 Thess. 1:9), this goes on to seriously undermine their faith. Christian life and mission then become seriously distorted by the unredeemed ego and/or the culture of the convert. There was a stage at South when we forgot this most basic of truths, and as a result, we indulged the false self. We never challenged the sinful motives and ideas that coalesce around selves formed outside of a relationship with God. The formation of a true self has everything to do with discipleship, mission, and evangelism. For instance, if we never challenged the identity, self-understanding, and lifestyle of the would-be convert (be they homosexual, straight, or otherwise), the result was an ill-born disciple, and he or she would either struggle in the faith or eventually give up following Jesus altogether. Of course, this death to the old self is required throughout the believer’s life, so it must begin at the start of the life of faith.

## Start Here: Imago Dei

Early in our ministry, we remember being deeply impacted by Rowland Croucher, a church consultant in Australia, when he led a workshop for ministers. He began by asking the question, “What is the first thing you can say about Adolf Hitler?” Answers to the question ranged from “horrifically evil” to “fallen,” and just about everything in between. At the end of the feedback, he simply said, “No, the most fundamental thing you can say about Hitler is that he is ‘like God’! Yes, he is fallen, evil, and degraded, but he too is made in the image of God. Even though it is very marred in him, it nonetheless is there.” He went on to say that no matter who we are or what we have done, this is the most fundamental truth about us all—we in some way reflect God.

Rowland was right, and our paradigms had been rocked! We had been scripted to give the first and obvious answer, that Hitler was indeed a sinner. But this was to get first and second truths the wrong way around. Sure, he—like us—is fallen and in need of redemption, but this is a secondary truth that only builds on the primary truth, which is that all humans carry the imago Dei. On this liberating truth rests a more genuinely biblical understanding of human beings. This truth also provides the disciple with a more compassionate (and humane) basis for mission and ministry. Let’s see how this works out in two takes.

**Take one:** If we operate assuming the primary truth is that every person is first and foremost a sinner, and that the image of God is all but obliterated, then the way we engage in our own personal discipleship and our missional endeavors will be radically altered. Historically, five-point Calvinism has tended to have a very negative, “worm-theology” view of humanity that has at times communicated a sense of self-hatred in its adherents and in the wider culture shaped by its teachings. In this view, our sense of sinfulness will tend to outweigh our sense of redemption: even though I will see myself as saved by Jesus, my primary identity as “sinner” will remain predominant and assert itself into my sense of who I am.

This negative view of the human reveals itself fully in the way we see, and subsequently treat, non-Christian people. Because the grace that covers the Christian person is not applied to the unsaved, the image of God within them will be obscured by their sinfulness and we will tend to view them in a dark and cynical light. But we miss the gift that lies under the mess of sin. Our focus will be on the external (behaviors and the like), rather than on the heart.

**Take two:** If we operate assuming the primary truth is that every person is first and foremost created in the image of God but is also fallen and capable of great evil, then we will still see ourselves as something very special that went badly wrong. In this viewpoint, there is something essential in our humanity that is fundamentally God-like, no matter how fallen we may perceive ourselves or others to be. Not only does this change us, but it should also profoundly modify the way we see people and therefore engage in mission. We can see beyond the sin and brokenness to a being that was made to reflect God. And even though something went badly wrong, this can—and must—be restored through Jesus’s saving work on our behalf. We will then have much more respect for the unbeliever and the sheer dignity of being human. Think again of the way Jesus treated people, and see which perspective fits better.

This paradigm shift has been incredibly significant in our ministry. While seeing the holy in the other has come more easily to Deb, Alan can recall having to choose to “see” the image of God in people. Al can remember an encounter with Howard, who was one of those people everyone would do everything to avoid. He was very needy, lacked social skills, cornered his victims, rubbed himself up against people when he hugged them, talked too much—you get the idea! One time Al was simply not able to dodge him and was effectively sequestered in a corner with him. He knew he was going to be there for a while. And then about halfway through their time together, the meaning of Howard, so to speak, came through. Al saw him as a marvelous, God-like creature. He can honestly say that it felt like an encounter with God in and through Howard.

Another humorous example: about fifteen years ago, Diana came into our lives. She was a transsexual-without-the-operation. Another profoundly unloved individual, she’d had a traumatic upbringing. Like many “trannies,” Diana was an over-the-top type of person people tended to reject and avoid. However, Deb lovingly pastored her and soon became the point of relational stability in her very topsy-turvy life. As a result, Diana decided to “adopt” us as parents. (Not a legal adoption, rather a relational one.) At first we tried to resist this, but eventually we gave in. In the beginning, in the midst of all the drama, we had to constantly remind ourselves that Diana bore the God-image, and in fact, in his/her rather strange kind of way, did it very well. She is an incredibly kind, generous, and forgiving person who will sacrificially serve others whenever a situation requires it. We can honestly say that we really do love her and have learned so much about God from her. We are proud to be her “adopted” parents.

Seeing the image of God in people generates compassion. Henri Nouwen makes the point that if we have true compassion for people, then we will not focus primarily on their outward behavior. And he is exactly right! We would add that if we start with the presupposition that the person is created in the image of God rather than simply being a sinner, we will be compelled to look to their heart and attempt to call forth the image of God we know is there, no matter how hidden. We are wise to remember the words of C. S. Lewis:

> There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, and civilizations—these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit—immortal horrors or everlasting splendors. This does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn. We must play. But our merriment must be of the kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously—no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption. And our charity must be real and costly love, with deep feeling for the sins in spite of which we love the sinners—no mere tolerance, or indulgence, which parodies love as flippancy parodies merriment. Next to the Blessed Sacrament itself, your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses.

## Ich und du

Following from this is the poetic Jewish philosophy of Martin Buber. Once again, if taken seriously, this can greatly impact our discipleship and missional endeavors. Buber talked about the two primary ways of relating. The first primary relationship is called “I-it.” This type of relationship is characterized by the objectification and control of nature and people. The “I” in this relationship seeks to acquire and possess as much as it can and perceives itself as being an individual set over against the objects in its orbit. When we treat people as a thing (as an it), we depersonalize them and see them as objects. First, this is to misunderstand their true nature, but it also changes the sense of self. The “I” in this relationship pays a price for such selfishness; it too becomes depersonalized because it is isolated and alienated from the source of life.

Alternatively, there is a more authentic and deeper way of relating to the world, which Buber calls the “I-Thou” relationship. This is the sphere where people come together and encounter one another on the deepest level possible. To relate to someone as a thou is to offer them the dignity and honor of being a holy other, another free being ... a person. We can see from this observation that Buber was not just talking about a casual conversation at the local pub or a heated negotiation to resolve a labor dispute, although these can indeed be occasions for such an encounter to take place. Rather, he is describing a meeting not only of minds but of souls, of wills, of that which resides at the core of one’s being. When you say “Thou” to another person, you are sharing the mystery of your being, you are responding with the totality of self to the Thou who is addressing you, you are meeting one another on the level of spirit.

Again, relating to people in this way changes the nature of the “I” as well as giving dignity to the “Thou.” Wonderfully, Buber says that when we do this we perceive reality from a new and higher vantage point. From this perspective I am able to extricate myself from the more closed world of I-it. I see that I am a free person, and this permits me to discern my destiny, the “grand will” guiding my life. Through my relationships, in which I give of myself, I will become real, more alive. When I am able to turn my being toward the center of reality I approach the face of God. By relating to our world in I-Thou terms, I am introduced into the world of God—the Eternal Thou.

Now, don’t let all the poetic philosophy and tricky language obscure the essentially biblical message about the meaning of people, relationships, and the way we relate to and find God in our world. Buber’s framework has been extremely influential in shaping our best thinking ever since he wrote on the topic (including C. S. Lewis, Karl Barth, Carl Rogers, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, to name a few). To see people as objects of almost impossible worth is to see them as God sees them. Just look deeply into the eyes of any person, recognize them as objects of God’s redeeming love in Jesus, act toward them in the way our Jesus acted, and you will change both yourself and your world. If God is love, as John so profoundly states, then Buber’s approach gets us much closer to seeing the world through the eyes of the love that is God. Hear these words again:

> Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins....
>
> And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God. And so we know and rely on the love God has for us.
>
> God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him. In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him. There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. (1 John 4:7–18)

## Own it!  
### The (real) shining

Finally, we have found it helpful to be reminded to “keep the end in mind” when it comes to understanding identity formation in both discipleship and mission. Theologian James Payton reminds us to look at salvation as *theosis*, the process of increasingly becoming “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4), rather than as a once off “get out of hell free card.” He turns to the Eastern Orthodox who emphasize this by starting with God’s words at creation: “Let us make human beings in our image, make them reflecting our nature” (Gen. 1:26 Message).

In Eastern Orthodox teaching, “image” and “likeness” are not the same: the first is gift, the second a goal. With these words, God distinguished what human beings were from what they were to become. Adam and Eve bore the image of God, but they were to grow into the divine likeness. They were to live in communion with God, walk in his ways, serve him, tend his creation, and love him and each other and the children they were to produce. If they did, they would grow in holiness, righteousness, and love—becoming ever more like God, who would bless them with the eternal life that belongs only to him.

Payton goes on to show that the idea of salvation as theosis, though not fully understood in evangelical circles, was something that strongly influenced John Wesley’s view of sanctification, as well as that of C. S. Lewis, who wrote, “God said that we were ‘gods’ and he is going to make good his words.”

Payton goes on to show some of the differences:

> In evangelicalism’s polished doctrinal teaching on salvation, we distinguish phases in the reception of salvation: conversion, justification, sanctification, and glorification. In the last step, we are completely conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29) and made like him (1 John 3:2). We are resurrected as glorified human beings, fully in communion with God, though remaining distinct from him.

> However, the way we typically speak about salvation emphasizes only the beginning of the process: conversion, justification, and to some degree, sanctification. Eastern Orthodoxy emphasizes the final result, the glorification by which we are made entirely like Christ: holy, righteous, perfect in godliness, and enjoying the fullness of eternal life. And in this, I believe Orthodox believers have something that can help better balance how we preach and teach about salvation.

This idea of being glorified through Christ seems to suggest that we are somehow incorporated, without loss of our individual, human uniqueness, into the Godhead through Jesus. Lewis coined the term “transposition” to describe this same phenomenon. “We are told in one of the creeds that the Incarnation worked ‘not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the Manhood into God.’ And it seems to me ... that humanity, still remaining itself, is not merely counted as, but veritably drawn into, Deity.”

To embrace this understanding is to always keep in mind the development of others and ourselves in becoming more like God. Salvation isn’t simply about changing behavior; it is about growing more and more into God himself and bringing that reality to bear on all humanity. We are changing, we are becoming more like God, and this changes everything!

Many things intrude on our sense of identity: vocations, culture, sexuality, idols, and other people, to name but a few. The formation of correct identity is crucial to both our discipleship and our mission into the world, because how we image ourselves is what we become. And how we view others determines the way we relate to them. As followers of Jesus, we must embrace our God-given identity, for it is as we embrace the imago Dei and live out of this image that we come alive to ourselves, to others, and to the world around us.

Kierkegaard was right in saying that how we relate to God determines everything, including our identity and, in fact, our very personhood; without God there is no possibility of a self. It is only when we ground ourselves in God and turn to him that we will be able to form our identity. Without this most fundamental relationship, we simply cannot develop into the people that God intends us to be. It is into his face that we must look, for without him we are nothing.

We finish with Meilaender’s description of a scene from *The Last Battle* (in *The Chronicles of Narnia* series), which powerfully illustrates this very thing.

> In the great scene of eschatological judgment at the conclusion of *The Last Battle*, a division is made between those who look on Aslan with love and those who do not. More accurately, the creatures of Narnia themselves make the division. As they come streaming up to the door of the stable at which Aslan stands, all must look on his face. Some look and find with delight the face for which they have always been searching. Others look and see only fear and terror. They veer off to the left into the nothingness created by Aslan’s shadow, and significantly, they cease at that moment to be Talking Beasts. In turning from Aslan they turn from their true selves; for loyalty to self in opposition to Aslan has turned out to be self-destructive loyalty.

## Practices

- **Read the Bible as identity statements:** This relates to the descriptive elements of the Bible, especially the New Testament. For instance, when it says that we are “holy ones” (saints), then accept that as a fact. We are not holy because of our behavior, but because we have been “sanctified in Christ.” These kinds of statements (such as “seated together with Christ,” “adopted into God’s family,” and “justified before God”) are essential markers of who we are in God.

- **Seek the face:** There is no Hebrew word for relationship, but the idea of relationship is fully contained in the notion of God’s face—the face is the essence of relationship. It follows that to know ourselves truly we must seek the face of God. This is not as easy as it sounds, because there are aspects of our humanity that resist a relationship to the holy. It is uncomfortable at times. But resting in God is absolutely essential to a healthy soul, and therefore to being a disciple. Loving God involves prayer and trust. Make sure you spend time alone with God.

- **Find yourself in relationships:** The other aspect of knowing ourselves is the social dimension. If we withdraw ourselves from the drive to know and be known by others, we damage our capacity to be authentic and healthy humans, let alone disciples. Practice friendships. Get to really know people. They provide an irreplaceable clue to knowing yourself.

- **See the image of God in others:** Look at people the way that God sees them, not as they present themselves to your immediate senses.

- **Take an audit of things that make up your identity:** This will involve relentless questioning, such as to what degree career, being a parent, a respected member of community, and so on plays in defining who you really are. These are important parts of our lives, but must be secondary to our identity in God.

- It can be helpful in your quest for greater understanding of the self and others to use the many wonderful personality profiles that are available.

## Group Discussion

- “Who am I?” “Where am I going?” and “Who will go with me?” Alan and Deb use these questions in marriage counseling with wannabe marrieds. Getting the order right when answering these questions is absolutely essential to maintaining the covenant of marriage; failure in the more basic questions creates real trouble later on. Discuss this in relation to discipleship, marriage, and community.
- Discuss how the Bible views the role of the ego in discipleship. Why does Jesus say that we must first die to self in order to follow him?
- Discuss the paradigm shift Debra and Alan experienced in relation to the imago Dei. How can this change the way you see people in your life?
- How can Buber’s teaching on “I and Thou” change your perspectives on life and people?
