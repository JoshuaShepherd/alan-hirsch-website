As we finish the initial drafts of this book, we are snowed in at a condo in Post Falls, Idaho. The presence of geese on the lake in such snowy conditions has reminded us of a parable told by Søren Kierkegaard. Søren grew up in the countryside surrounded by farms that reared geese (among other animals). Each spring he would watch as a new gaggle of goslings hatched and grew. Over the course of their short lives, these geese would gorge themselves at constantly refilled troughs of grain until they were so fat they could hardly walk. He imagined that they believed their lives to be perfect, as every need they had was catered to in abundance.

When autumn came, the truth became apparent. The wild geese that had spent the warm summer months in Denmark would gather in preparation for their southerly migration. They would circle in the skies above the farms, calling out to any stragglers to join in their flight. At this point, the farmed geese would lift their heads from the feeding troughs and look into the skies, heeding the call of their untamed cousins. Listening to the call of the wild, they would become animated, running as best they could around their enclosures, emulating flight. Of course, their gluttonous diet and life of luxury meant they were far too fat to get airborne, and they probably didn’t really want to join their untamed cousins on that perilous journey anyhow—but their instincts drove them at least to emulate flight on the ground. The wild geese would fly off and the fattened, domesticated geese would simply return to their barnyard existence, ignorant of the farmer’s grim ultimate purpose—they were destined for the table.

Kierkegaard’s parable goes on to tell of a wild goose who looked with dismay at his domesticated cousins. In the interest of food and relative luxury, they had given up flight for the mediocrity of the barnyard. With splendid motivation, he decided to spend some time with them in order to help them awaken to their true calling as geese and join the others in wild flight. Sadly, he lived there until he himself was tamed. Every year, when the wild geese would honk in flight overhead, he, like the others, would flutter his wings, rise a bit, and resolve to join them. But he never did. Instead, he finally became content to remain with the tamed and flightless—destined for the table. Kierkegaard ends his parable with a warning: while a wild goose can be tamed, seldom does a tame goose become wild again.

As disciples we are called to an untamed existence. Like the wild geese, we are meant to live wild and dangerous lives, flying above the heads of our generation, calling them to the authenticity of what they were created to do. Instead, we have allowed ourselves to be dulled into a life of mediocrity, where the only wild journeys we ever take are in our dreams.

We started this book with the parable of the skylark that sold its feathers for worms, and we end it with a parable that calls us to forgo a domesticated Christianity and adopt a life of untamed and risky discipleship. Clearly there are two common themes in the two parables. First, we should be aware of the surreptitious danger of domestication and other cultural encroachments on our discipleship. Second, the parables remind us that when we reach deep into ourselves, we realize that we are made for greater things and long to be all that Jesus wants us to be.

We don’t for a moment think it is impossible to reactivate our discipleship once we have forsaken it. And while it will be hard to disentangle ourselves from the snares of idolatry, we already have all the resources we need to change the world. Jesus lives in us, we are bearers of the gospel of God, and we have the power and presence of the Holy Spirit. We have a community committed to the cause of the kingdom. But if we are going to recover discipleship in the way of Jesus, we will have to discard the things that keep us from fulfilling that destiny. We have to reclaim our feathers as well as the will to fly. We have some choices to make.

This book has explored some of the cultural, theological, and missiological hindrances that keep us from becoming the untamed people we are created to be in Jesus. We need to move beyond our many distorted understandings of Jesus, God, self, church, sexuality, money, status, family, and mission to rediscover the sheer liberating power of the biblical gospel. We know you want it, because this is what every human being wants and is made for. Jesus sets us free! Now go and find it for yourself!

> It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. (Gal. 5:1)

# Afterword

## A Call to an Untamed Adventure

In middle school, my brother and I went on an African safari. We were born less than a year apart and traveled in East Africa on the type of adventure most young boys only dream about. Anything but tame—this trip had close encounters with wild animals of every kind.

Our journey first took us to a hotel on stilts overlooking a water hole. The hotel is called Treetops. Wild animals would come from miles around to drink at the water hole, and tourists like us could observe them in their natural habitat from above. Of course, we were not the first ones to have had this view—the monkeys and baboons lived in the treetops before tourists ever came. The afternoon when we checked in to the hotel, we were warned to keep our windows closed so that these curious hosts wouldn’t steal our possessions while we were asleep. The primates were so at home in the Treetops that they would actually mingle among the people, sometimes reaching right into their bags to take shiny objects such as cameras or purses. I learned not to consider these animals as tame simply because they were comfortable in close proximity to people.

I was on the top platform the next morning and saw a grey baboon reaching into a woman’s purse to steal her camera (it seems crime is everywhere these days). He was close enough for me to reach out and touch, and I was foolish enough that I did. I actually grabbed his tail for just an instant. In a flash, the animal had spun around with a mouth wide open and screaming. I saw teeth that were longer than my second-period math class and sharper than Rachael Cohen in the first row who always raised the class curve! I quickly let go of the tail and froze with fear. The baboon took the camera and left. I’m actually surprised he didn’t take a picture of the look on my face to show the rest of the troop for a good laugh.

Later that night I was not very hungry, so I decided to stay in our bungalow while my mother and brother went up to the lodge for dinner. Around dessert time I had a remarkable recovery and felt hungry, so I decided to join the meal, walking up to the lodge from our bungalow after dark. On the way to the lodge, I noticed something unusual, but since everything I was seeing was unusual to me, I didn’t think much of it. Throughout the evening some zebra and impala would graze on the lawn, but this time there were none to be found. I kept walking up to the lodge and then noticed all the people inside watching me through the windows lit up from the interior lights. They were waving at me. Some seemed to be compelling me to return to my bungalow, others seemed to be telling me to hurry up and get inside. I had no clue as to why, but I hastened my step. Once I was inside I was told that a leopard was out on the grass stalking me. Fortunately, the sharpshooters had their rifles trained on her in case she wanted a little dessert herself. Wow, I thought, now there’s a story that will impress my friends back at school. I remember thinking: how many kids at my school can boast a leopard has stalked them?

Within a couple weeks I had seen cheetahs, lions, giraffe, elephants, and hordes of wildebeest. I had been chased in a Land Rover by a rhinoceros and grunted at in a very threatening way by a bull. I had tried to catch foot-long lizards that lived in a palace (Prov. 30:28), and was eaten alive by more flies than Steven King could use in a horror movie.

I tell you this story of my adventures in untamed Africa because there is a lesson found there about life. There were two boys on this trip, both were the same age and of the same upbringing. I came home lucky to have all my fingers and lots of stories. My brother went on the same trip, but instead of recklessly living such an adventure, he spent most of his time reading a novel about adventures in Africa. We both had a great time, but one of us came home with stories to tell.

There are two kinds of people in the world: those who live the adventure, and those who only read about others living the adventure. I determined a long time ago that I wasn’t going to be someone who only reads about the adventures of others—I would live a life of adventure. Full gusto, go-for-it faith that abandons all on the risk that God is indeed real and will carry me through.

In *Untamed*, Alan and Debra Hirsch have challenged us to live a life of reckless faith, a life worth telling stories about. They have dared us to abandon the domestic faith of suburban consumer “churchianity” in order to live a life of risk for the love of a Savior who left heaven to live among the poor and marginalized people of a backward and oppressed world.

The true Jesus is not safe and sterile, conflicted by a mission and a passive kindness—which Hollywood typically portrays and Christians are comfortable believing in. He said things that offended others regularly. He never carried the party line. Jesus shocked his foes, his friends, and his followers with equal doses.

The Hirsches wrote, “His was a wild holiness that calls to account all who refuse to deal with God, preferring instead to follow the lame dictates of a religion of ethical codes and pious rituals.”

Alan and Debra went on to pose a revealing question and counter-question that opened our eyes to the tamed existence we have grown accustomed to: “What is it about the holiness of Jesus that caused ‘sinners’ to flock to him like a magnet and yet manages to seriously antagonize the religious people?

This question begs yet another, even more confronting question: Why does our more churchy form of holiness seem to get it the other way around?”

They went on to explain: “One of the greatest counterfeits for following the untamed Jesus comes from the substitution of morals and decency for Jesus’s untamed kind of holiness. One of the standard attempts to stereotype, and therefore domesticate, Jesus is to make him into a moral teacher, someone who taught us how to live decent, rule-based lives.”

As Spurgeon once commented: Morality may keep you out of jail, but it will not keep you out of hell. The holiness of God is much more than a tamed and moral existence. Jesus was on a mission to rescue not those who were moral, but those who were broken and imprisoned by evil. He was destined to reach into dark and sin-infested places to call out and redeem the beautiful image of God found in people that were enslaved by evil. He did not hang out in safe places. I imagine that today you would be more likely to find Jesus in a gay bar than a church service. If he went to a religious service, he would be likely to overturn the book tables and chase away the sales people. He risked his reputation to be with the people that needed saving and knew they did. This is our Savior. His mission has not altered or changed in two thousand years, and he bids us to join him. Are you willing to walk into some dangerous places with Jesus at your back? *Untamed* has told us what it means to follow such a wild and dangerous Messiah.

When I first heard that Alan and Debra were coming to live for a time in the States, I must admit to being very excited. My joy, actually, was as much (if not more) about Deb’s coming as it was for Alan! You see, I have come to know these two and I truly believe that we need Debra’s gifts and influence in these days as much as her genius of a husband. Yes, Alan is Debra Hirsch’s husband, not the other way around! It is my honor in writing the afterword to this book to commend to you this incredible woman of God who has a needed message for us in these days.
