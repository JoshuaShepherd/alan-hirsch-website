# The Church That Jesus Built

“Every believer a church planter, every church a church-planting church” is one of the most powerful mantras to come out of the Chinese Underground Church in recent history. It’s a great slogan, not simply because it is the key to unlocking a people movement, but because it faithfully captures and communicates the incredible potential that is contained in every individual disciple—it legitimizes the fact that every believer is an agent of the King and therefore has the potential for world transformation in him or her. Dig deep into these few words and you will find that the full potencies of the church that Jesus built are actually coded into it. As a seed contains the full potential of the tree, so the tree contains the full potential of the forest. But it’s all there in the seed in the first place. Likewise, as a spark contains the full potential of the flame, so the flame contains the potential of the forest fire. But it’s all contained in the spark. Recognizing the world-transforming power of the people of God is essential to becoming a missional church again in the West.

If you lived in China and came to know Jesus through this particular movement, you would be told before you committed your life to Christ that it is expected that little ol’ you will one day have the privilege of starting and leading a community of faith (usually not big or complex), and that this will be one of the joys and privileges that come with following Jesus. It is also expected that the church will itself plant many other churches in its lifetime—however long that might be. In other words, it is expected that there is actually a potential movement in every believer. Disciples are designed to change their world—that’s why Jesus could entrust the gospel to the first disciples, knowing the inevitability of the message itself.

This all sounds pretty radical to those of us whose idea of church is captivated by an institutionally stylized way of seeing ourselves. In fact, we believe that this “scripting” actually inhibits us from becoming the untamed Jesus revolution we are made to be. Implicit in the slogan above is the core belief that everyone, young and old, male and female, spiritually mature and immature, rich and poor—everyone—gets to play a role in the unfolding drama of the church as Jesus designed it to be. This of course raises many serious questions about how we in the West have become a domesticated (and domesticating) institution, even though we live by the same gospel under the rule of the same Lord as our Chinese brothers and sisters. Surely we carry the same potential in ourselves and in our communities as our Chinese counterparts. What are the obstacles that stop us from becoming a dynamic movement? What’s the difference?

In this chapter we want to address a number of issues related to our understanding of the church. Now, we fully recognize that countless books have been written on ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church) and we don’t want to claim too much in one single chapter. It is not our intention to say all that there is to say about the one true church (if there is one), nor do we wish to idealize it. The church is what it is. What we want to do is perhaps expose a few glitches in our understanding that hold us back from becoming the collection of untamed disciples that Jesus calls us to be.

## The Community for Me

Of all the ways culture influences the church, nothing has had more of an impact on us than that of a consumerist vision of society. As we stated in the previous chapter, in some way or another we have all been impacted by the powerful experience of a society that is preoccupied with the acquisition of consumer goods. From good old Santa Claus (a religious symbol co-opted to disciple children in thoroughgoing materialism from early childhood on) to the complete ubiquity of niche marketing, we are daily being nurtured in the worldview generated by late capitalism of the twenty-first century—consumerism. It’s a genuine -ism because it implies that more than just basic needs are being met. Twenty-first-century consumerism is much more a generator of wants than it is a fulfiller of basic human needs. And it must do this to keep the massive engines of the global economy running—if they stop, the whole thing will come collapsing down on our heads.

It is a religious scripting born of a powerful economic system. As we have already seen, consumerism exhibits the hallmarks of a very virile meta-spirituality offering meaning, identity, purpose, and belonging to its various devotees. Make no mistake, we are all being discipled into “the faith” many times a day and throughout our lives by a combination of trillion-dollar advertising budgets with the delivery of immediate reward for good behavior (read “purchases”). It is, for all intents and purposes, a disciple-making system of its own—and a powerful one at that.

The church, far from being immune, has drunk deeply from its wells. In fact, we have pretty much designed contemporary expressions of church around consumer values. It’s not all bad. In many ways this is a legitimate expression of the contextualization of the church. But when attempts at contextualization concede too much to the culture and distort the fundamental beliefs and practices that shape us, then we must challenge it.

This radically affects discipleship. The implicit message church members get from a church that adopts a consumer-driven model (with marketing and all) is that they are essentially discerning consumers and that the local church is a vendor of religious goods and services. No longer is the church a disciple-making medium operating under the Great Commission; rather, the church is viewed as existing to serve my spiritual needs, and if it doesn’t fulfill them according to my particular tastes, then I simply find one that does. In this case, the community exists for me, not me for the community.

Viewed from the perspective of untamed discipleship, something is seriously wrong with that equation. This is very personal for us: in *The Forgotten Ways*, Alan tells the story of how at one point in our life together at South it dawned upon us that in focusing on creating cool, experimental worship and cultivating an embracing community with a party-like atmosphere, we had all but missed the point of making disciples. We had just created more fussy consumers. As previously mentioned, the Willow Creek Association came up with a similar conclusion in their findings based on massive research across the system. In *Reveal*, the courageous book that documents their findings, they confess that for all the sexiness of seeker worship and its effectiveness in evangelism, it basically has failed to make mature disciples of Jesus. This is no small confession from the leading church in the seeker-sensitive movement—we must take notice.

It’s as though the church-as-vendor has become a giant feeding trough where largely capable, middle-class people come to eat their fill. Actually, many don’t even eat for themselves; they come to “get fed”! The very language of “getting fed” at church betrays the fact that many attendees are not disciples at all, but rather passive (and somewhat dependent) consumers. Want to test this? Simply stop preaching every Sunday for six weeks, or close down the children’s ministry, or stop some other “service” or another, even temporarily, and see what happens. Attendance and tithing will drop immediately. Disciples tithe to the Lord; consumers are merely paying for services. There is a world of difference between the two. Thinking of the church as some sort of feeder is an obstacle to discipleship that must be overcome if we want to be untamed Christians.

We remember many years ago hearing prominent discipleship proponent Bill Hull compare the process of discipleship with that of being a child and growing up. It’s a great metaphor. For instance, when we are babies, it is appropriate to get fed, as one clearly cannot feed oneself. But as we mature, we learn to feed ourselves, and eventually we learn to cook and feed others. But this is not what we find happening in many churches. In fact, if we had to be honest with ourselves, the systems we have developed actually create dependencies. We are not helping people grow up into the type of disciples that will change the world in which they live, and the clergy and religious professionals who maintain this are entirely complicit. The word in social psychology is co-dependent! Imagine this: if a mother was still breastfeeding her ten-year-old child, we would think something was wrong (mainly with mom in this case), but if the child was twenty years old, then the two of them would probably be jailed or committed to the psych ward!

We think this is nothing less than a faulty (and perhaps an overly pastoral) view of the church that is being perpetuated here, and it needs some serious correction. We don’t say this to be mean or disparaging of the sincere ministries of many wonderful people, but it is wrong to create and foster dependent consumers when we should be about disciple making. It has to be said, or else we will simply perpetuate the situation. And we believe part of the problem stems from the dangerous (and profoundly false) division between the clergy and “laity,” which creates a professional and amateur Christian class.

We need to stop thinking of the church as service provider, as a consumable product, as something that exists for my (and by extension, my family’s) personal benefit. Rather, we must move from the-community-for-me to me-for-the-community.

Jesus is clear about this; it is in loving that we are loved, and in giving that we will receive.

## MORE!

At South we took the “priesthood of all believers” (that every person is a minister and needs to be released as such) seriously. This didn’t mean that our community always lived this out, but it was a value we tried to live by (and at times used humor to reinforce). In order to drive this point home, one Sunday morning, as our community arrived for our gathering, we greeted each person at the door and handed them a two-inch-wide strip of white flexible card and a fastener. Many looked puzzled but decided to play along, wondering just what we were up to. A short time after the service began, Al asked everybody to stand up and fasten the white strip around their necks. He then proceeded to lead the whole church through an ordination ceremony. It wasn’t quite what people were expecting, but that morning each and every person gathered at South was officially ordained into the ministry of Jesus. Once they were all ordained, they could dispose of the symbolic (and very unnecessary) dog collars and just live out their commission.

When we look at the early church, the Chinese Underground Church, and every other Jesus movement that has had significant impact in its time and place, we are confronted with the reality of a people movement where everyone is regarded as a significant agent of the King and is encouraged to find their place in the unfolding of the movement. In other words, in the church that Jesus built, everyone gets to play! For these movements, a person’s conversion is their commission into ministry, and this is exactly the way Jesus designed his church to be. Disciples simply are ministers—they are designed that way.

Contrast this notion that everyone is engaged in ministry with a recent, somewhat generic experience when we visited a relatively new church plant where the whole service was basically a one-man show. The pastor opened the service with announcements and prayer, then handed it over to the worship leader to sing the few ever-present Hillsong hits. Then it was handed back to the pastor for the sermon, offering, and closing prayer. Now, sadly, this picture isn’t an unfamiliar one, but the tragedy here was that it was a new church plant! These guys had an opportunity to do things differently, to be more inclusive, to break away from what we all surely recognize as an outdated model of church. We don’t want to sound harsh here, and perhaps our response is more about style and cultural differences. But we fear it at least has something to do with theological deficiencies in the common understanding of church, worship, and discipleship.

Recently when speaking at a conference engaging the issue of becoming a missional church, Alan was politely dancing around the idea of the priesthood of all believers, its significance for movements, and how ordination might be problematic. The denominational leader, being a good, forthright Canadian, sprang up and loudly invited Alan to take the gloves off and just say it as it is. To which Alan said, slightly tongue in cheek, “OK then, I really think that ordination is a doctrine of devils!” Once the laughter subsided, Alan delved into why this actually had some real truth to it. The idea that ordination as we commonly practice it is demonic in source was not simply suggested for dramatic effect. If one wanted to destroy the sheer transformative power of the body of Christ as a people movement, then the creation of the clergy-laity divide is nothing less than a stroke of demonic genius. One of the most catastrophic—heinous is not too strong a word—barriers to being a truly untamed church full of authentic disciples lies in the suppression of one of the most potent of Christian truths about the church—the priesthood of all believers.

It is interesting that although Martin Luther rediscovered this potent aspect of the New Testament teaching—the priesthood of all believers—as soon as the truth of it began to leak out to the peasants, he quickly hid it again because he feared losing control of “his reformation.” Instead of backing the people, he opted for the age-old Christendom embrace with the state and called in the prince and his troops to quash the peasants’ uprising. This was his lowest moment.

We highly recommend that you and your community look into doing the APEST test, which will help people understand their multi-layered ministry styles and get needed feedback and accountability from the group. Go to [www.apest.org](http://www.apest.org).

And by and large, for Protestants and Catholics, it has remained a mere doctrine ever since. Every now and again it pops up—we would argue that it is an aspect of every revival and renewal of the church—only to be suppressed again by the rise of religious professionalism (clericalism). If we are going to answer the challenge of our time, we are simply going to have to recover this untamed piece of New Testament truth again.

We suggest that there have to be several shifts for this to take place in the local church.

### From “minister” to ministry team

In movements it is important to distribute power and function to the outermost level. As described above, one of the biggest shifts needed is to de-professionalize the ministry/clergy class and give ministry back to the people of God. This does not mean that we do not have leaders: any movement that makes any impact has definite leadership. They simply don’t confuse leadership with ministry. Not all are leaders, but all are ministers. Leadership is a calling within a calling.

### From pastoral team to APEST team

We believe it is absolutely critical to broaden our concept of ministry from the traditional pastor-teacher models to at least the fivefold understanding of ministry giftings described in Ephesians 4:1–16 (apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors/shepherds, and teachers, hence the acronym APEST). This does not diminish the irreplaceable roles shepherds and teachers play in the life of the church, but indicates that if we want an untamed, missional Christianity, we simply have to embrace a more missional form of ministry as well. The shepherd and teacher are basically maintenance ministers—they maintain health in an existing community. What is needed for missional impact beyond the congregation are the more generative ministries associated with the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic giftings. When we restructured our ministry at South along these lines, it unleashed elemental spiritual energies in our church.

One of the most revolutionary aspects of the Ephesians 4 text is that it is not a leadership text—it is a text about the ministry of the church! This is another dimension of the priesthood of all believers. Look at it—it is a circular letter written to the entire church. Leadership is implicit, not explicit, in the text. One of the most potent things any community can do is to re-legitimize the Ephesians 4 ministries and help develop people in their various ministries, in other words, grow them from undeveloped ministers into mature, Christlike leaders.

### From men of God to people of God

We remember exceptional church leader and friend Mike Breen once saying something like this: “However one might understand the controversial texts in Paul’s writings regarding the place of women in ministry, the greater sin by far is to relegate women to the role of being secondary agents in the kingdom.” We couldn’t agree more.

One of the biggest hindrances to the untamed discipleship of all of God’s people is the binding of ministry and leadership to the role of men. Not only are many of our problems directly created by the false and profoundly unbiblical category of ordination as described above, but we have effectively cauterized more than half the ministry of the body of Christ. Felicity Dale, one of the global leaders of the house church movement, speaks of the American church as being hemiplegic—a condition where one half of a person’s body is paralyzed. In other words, we work with only one arm, one leg, one eye, and so on. She rightfully says that the church in America will never reach its fullest potential unless it takes seriously the women’s issue. The whole body needs to be released in order to fulfill God’s purposes.

It’s interesting to note that in just about every outbreak of a missional church movement in history, women have played a critical and up-front role.

Around 65 percent of the leaders of the church in China are women! It is similar in the exploding people movements of India at the moment. The early (pre-Constantinian) church was free from the issue we so struggle with, as were the Wesleyan revivals, the Salvation Army, the Azusa Street phenomenon that launched Pentecostalism, the Jesus People, and so it goes. Interestingly, God doesn’t appear to have the same hang-ups certain sections of our church currently have regarding women’s involvement in official church ministry. It’s time to find our way beyond the current impasse and recognize that God gives women equal status and agency in his kingdom.

As mentioned in the introduction, ministry for us has always been a partnership. Both of us felt a clear call to serve God with our lives; for us it was never about one of us being called into the ministry and the other one “supporting” them in it. We represent God far better together than we ever could apart.

## Undercover Discipling!

Another strong paradigm we need to break down is that discipling is limited to Christians within the context of the church, and performed by a select few. The Great Commission tells us that each and every one of us is to engage in the role of discipling the nations—it is our biblical mandate.

> And Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” (Matt. 28:18–20)

This means first that all of us are called to disciple others—discipling is the task of every Christian. Second, it means discipleship is not just for those who have accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior—it’s for everyone! We believe it a great mistake to restrict discipling to just Christians and keep it within the confines of the Christian community. We as believers are called to disciple everyone who comes into our orbit of influence—it’s that simple.

If each believer understood discipleship in this way and then took their biblical mandate seriously, we would have lots of people growing and becoming more and more like Jesus—and hopefully at some point coming under his lordship. It’s not our role to convert them, but to disciple them. Conversion is God’s business. How much better would the world be? And the fun thing is that in many cases those who haven’t yet accepted Jesus as Lord may have no idea that they are being discipled!

We so easily forget that the role of the church is to form what we call “little Jesuses.” C. S. Lewis rightly reminds us of this fact.

> It is easy to think that the Church has a lot of different objects—education, buildings, missions, holding services.... [But] the Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them into little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time. God became man for no other purpose. It is even doubtful, you know, whether the whole universe was created for any other purpose. It says in the Bible that the whole universe was made for Christ and that everything is to be gathered together in Him.

If Lewis is right that the whole universe was made for Christ and everything is to be gathered together in him, then the Great Commission is not about “evangelism” as we have come to understand it—that is, simply telling people what Jesus has done for them and leaving it at that. It is not just about the transfer of vital information, a data download, but rather the transfer of the very life of Christ through the medium and message of our own discipleship. It is about bringing people closer to Jesus and teaching them his ways. It is about loving people and exposing them to the grace and wonder of God’s heart, helping them see and experience the values of the kingdom and calling forth those values that may lie dormant in their own hearts and lives. It is about letting the beauty of Jesus and his kingdom come through. Let’s tease this out with a couple of examples.

### “Stitch ’n’ Bitch”

The women in our community house decided to gather together a number of non-Christian colleagues in order to build relationships, love on them, and ultimately, over time, help them become more like Jesus (undercover discipling). So we set up what we called a “Stitch ’n’ Bitch” night. This was simply a time when women came together to knit and connect with each other. Well, it was a great hit, with heaps of women joining in. One of the first things we established with the group was that the night wasn’t going to just be about us, that we needed to also somehow serve our community. As our home was located in the red-light district and it was the middle of winter, we decided to start by knitting scarves, one for ourselves and one for the working girls who were freezing out on the streets. Of course, we had to make sure they were more sexy than what our own grandmas would knit! Over time, our projects included cooking for people in a trailer park, doing up Christmas packs for the homeless, and becoming involved in the Make Poverty History campaign.

Our intention with these women was ultimately for them to know Jesus. So we began to disciple them. Did they know we were doing that? Absolutely not—I doubt they would have come at all if they did. Rather, our discipling of them was to expose them to the values of the kingdom and the heart of Jesus for the outcast. These women knew that we were believers, but we never abused our relationship with them by imposing our views or inappropriately “evangelizing” them in the narrow understanding of this term. We exposed their hearts to the issues of injustice and serving others, and helped put the poor on their radar. Most of these women started as professional women concerned with becoming affluent, getting bigger and better homes, and living more comfortable lifestyles. Discipling for them meant that over time they began to look more like Jesus by embracing values that were more in line with the kingdom, and as this transformation began questions about God and Jesus started taking place.

### “Mentoring” Jack

Imagine this: you know your neighbor Jack, at least enough to be chummy with him. Taking this discipleship approach, you might begin the journey by saying, “You know, Jack, we get along just fine, but I have been thinking. I believe part of the reason for my life is to make yours a whole lot better. I have some skills in developing people. How about I invest some time into helping you achieve your greatest dreams?” If Jack says, “Sure, lets give it a go” (people like Jack pay up to a thousand dollars an hour for good life-coaching), what will happen is that we will start sharing the events, people, stories, and dreams that have come together to make Jack what he is today. Eventually, the dreaming gets beyond the red Ferrari, meaning will be shared at a deeper level, and Jack will begin to communicate his deepest longings, hurts, fears, and hopes. If all goes well, God does “his thing” on Jack, and he becomes a believer. We suggest that we just continue the process of discipleship: the process does not change even though the content will.

We want to propose that this be taken with the utmost seriousness: put aside your prevailing understandings of evangelism and simply (re)adopt the Great Commission as your guide. We suggest that we should all simply disciple people everywhere. And we should see discipleship as a process, illustrated above—including pre-conversion discipleship and, if God does his thing, post-conversion discipleship. The person’s salvation is God’s business; our part in it is to be a “little Jesus” that devotes significant time and commitment to making disciples of whoever wants to go on the journey with us. Of course it’s about Jesus, and we will get to share the saving message of Jesus along the way, but we need to reframe evangelism within the context of discipleship. That’s where it belongs in the Bible (read the Great Commission again)! If we fail to take this seriously, then discipleship just drops off the agenda, we become preachy Bible pushers, and the church actually forgets its own mandate.

#### Pre-Conversion Discipleship → Conversion → Post-Conversion Discipleship

Now, before you dismiss this as a tad weird for your liking, we suggest that in fact this was precisely the case with Jesus and his followers. The question scholars argue over is when the disciples were actually “born again.” Some say John 20:22, where Jesus breathes the Spirit on them, and others say that it was actually at Pentecost (Acts 2). None would say before that! So, even “the Twelve” (and “the Seventy”) were all what we would call “pre-conversion disciples.” What is more, the standard practice in the church in its first three centuries was that people had to prove their adherence to Jesus in discipleship before they were allowed to become part of the church! This was the original purpose of the catechisms. In other words, discipleship started long before a person became a convert. In movements that change the world, discipleship is an ethos—a way of life—not just an optional extra for the more dedicated Christians. That we have somehow managed to build a church without discipleship is anathema to authentic Christian faith.

Actually, this squares pretty nicely with what evangelism gurus call the Engels Scale, which acknowledges that there is a definite process people undergo in coming to faith and growing in discipleship. It will look something like the following continuum, ranging from –6 to +6:

-6 Awareness of supreme being  
-5 Initial awareness of Gospel  
-4 Positive attitude towards Gospel  
-3 Personal problem recognition  
-2 Decision to act  
-1 Repentance and faith in Christ  
New birth in Christ  
+1 Post-decision evaluation  
+2 Incorporation into Body  
+3 Growth in Jesus  
+4 Communion with God  
+5 Stewardship  
+6 Reproduction  

Reframing mission and evangelism around discipleship makes space for long-term, authentically loving relationships with the various people in our lives. This in turn will give credibility to our message and space for real and meaningful friendships—something we are not always known for. And hey, if everyone did this with just two or three people in a lifetime (in a “pay-it-forward”-style movement), we would actually get the job done in one generation!

## Wells and Fences

Another way we can become a disciple-making community is by reframing church to include pre-conversion disciples on the journey. In *The Shaping of Things to Come*, Alan and Michael Frost discuss the idea of social set theory (the theory of social dynamics, or how and why people gather together as they do) by illustrating it with a practice in farming. In some farming communities, the farmers might build fences around their properties to keep their livestock in and the livestock of neighboring farms out. But in rural communities, where farms or ranches cover an enormous geographic area, fencing the property is out of the question. In our home of Australia, ranches (called stations) are so vast that fences are simply not a viable way of keeping the animals together. Under these conditions, a farmer has to sink a bore and create a well, a precious water supply in the outback. It is assumed that livestock, though they will stray, will never roam too far from the well, lest they die. As long as there is a supply of clean water, the livestock will remain close by.

In social set theory, the two main reasons people organize and/or gather are the following: the closed, or bounded, set, and the open, or centered, set.

### The bounded set

The closed, or bounded, set describes a social system that has clearly delineated boundaries but no strong ideological center. It is therefore hard at the edges and soft at the center. In this type of church, it is clear who is “in” and who is “out” based primarily on a well-defined boundary—usually moral and cultural (for example, dress and language) as well as theological. Viewed in this light, most established institutions, including denominational systems, are clearly bounded sets.

```
weak theological vision-center

# In Out

Closed (or Bounded) Set
```

### The centered set

Then there are open, or centered, sets. In many ways, these are the exact opposite of the bounded ones. They have a very clear ideology and vision at the center, but have no real boundaries that people have to cross in order to join. This organization is therefore hard at the center and soft at the edges. It is more of an open invitation to join on the basis of vision and values. We propose that it offers us a far more missional, and in many ways a far more biblical, way of being the church that Jesus built. To use the ranch example above, churches that see themselves as a centered set recognize that Jesus is Lord at the heart of the community and that the gospel is so refreshing that, like a well in the Australian outback, people who are thirsty will not stray too far from it.

Conceiving church as an open set engenders a truly Christ-centered approach to holding together, unlike the more standard religious organizations with their theological and cultural boundaries and formulas, developed to keep certain people in and others out. Rather than seeing people as Christian or non-Christian, as “in” or “out,” we would see people by the degree of distance they are from the center. In this way, we see people as Christian, not-yet-Christian, and somewhere on the path toward (or away from) Jesus in discipleship. It allows us to see anyone who identifies with the movement as being somewhere on the journey of discipleship. And because of this, we can acknowledge the contribution of not-yet-Christians to the Christian community.

```

Open (or Centered) Set
```

Clearly Jesus’s faith community was a centered set, with himself at the center and all sorts of weird and wonderful people in his orbit—some far, some close, others edging closer, still others moving away. Clearly some disciples are closer to the center than others (Peter, James, and John), and at least one disciple drew away from the center (Judas). The Gospels speak of faith communities varying from twelve to one hundred twenty, and make explicit reference to a number of women who traveled with Jesus. It seems that the community of Christ was not as simple as thirteen guys roaming the countryside. There was a rich intersection of relationships, with some nearer the center and others farther away, but all were openly invited to join in the kingdom-building enterprise. In many ways, this kind of movement allows for a sense of belonging before believing.

### Belonging before believing

At South, adopting a more centered-set approach to being the people of God meant we took seriously the whole concept of belonging before believing: people didn’t need to agree with us on the finer points of theology in order to belong. They were invited into a journey that led to Jesus. The closer people would get to Jesus, the more they were pulled into his orbit, and eventually into conversion. The closer people get to Jesus, the more likely they are to be formed into disciples. Viewed from “the side,” a centered-set church, operating as a community of disciples, calls people into greater commitment to Jesus.

```

```

Divergent ideology or behavior didn’t necessarily exclude people from the family (although in some rare cases, church discipline was necessary, mainly because of some sort of predatory behavior—sexual, theological, or otherwise). We operated from the simple basis that if people wanted to hang around a bunch of Christians, then in most cases it was because they found something attractive about the Jesus factor in us. We overcame our anxieties about the stranger by living out the belief that “greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world” (1 John 4:4 KJV), and that we were like yeast in the dough.

A case in point was when an openly gay man named Adam, a practicing wiccan, became part of our community. While he was resistant to Christianity, he was a deeply spiritual man and would show up at our church gatherings every now and again. One Sunday morning Deb was asking for volunteers to help with the church newsletter and, much to her surprise, he volunteered. Conflicted over what to do, Deb tried to stay true to the “centered set” approach and accepted his offer. This meant he came in to use the church computer every Tuesday, where he compiled the community news as well as other bits of creative writing. He saw himself as a writer-poet and really did develop the newsletter significantly. Over time, through hanging out and working with us, Adam came to see the great beauty of Jesus and wrote the most amazing poem about how he identified with the sufferings of Christ.

Adopting a “centered set” approach and allowing people like Adam to belong before they believe is certainly risky, but if we lock them out of our lives because of their lifestyles then they may never come to know Jesus. It is us who are meant to shine the light of Christ to this dark and lost world. We have allowed fear to dominate and our need for safety and security to keep the world at a safe distance.

### Letting go of control

We found that one trick of being an open-set missional church is getting over our need to control people and processes, and to instead open the way for people to meet with Jesus in the community. One way to do this is simply to see ourselves as priests (1 Peter 2:9). Consistent with what priests ought to do, our role is to mediate the true knowledge of God and maintain the God relationship. Practically, it means that our function is to introduce others to a right understanding of God. This does not mean that we legislate morality in the name of Jesus—our job is to free people, not to bind them up with religious complexities.

We ourselves experienced freedom from control-freakery by renovating our idea of priesthood. We needed to, because much of our early ministry involved working with street prostitutes and the drug-addicted—people whose lives were normally out of control. Most of these people were working the streets not because they thought it was a good career, but because of horrific life circumstances exacerbated by drug addiction. This meant that their lives were utterly broken and chaotic.

In the beginning of our ministry, we mistakenly saw it as our role to take control of their lives—to make right choices on their behalf—hoping that it would turn their lives around. In almost every case this failed. Deliverance came to us when it dawned on us that it was not our role to control people, but rather to bring them into an authentic relationship with God. He would do all the changing that was needed. When we played the role of the Holy Spirit, we inevitably bungled it. It was liberating indeed to realize he was a whole lot better at it than we could possibly be. The disciple is a servant-priest, and our role is to introduce people to Jesus and Jesus to the people, and then, as quickly as possible, move out of the way.

### Open-set communion

One of the ways we symbolized the idea of the centered set was by having an openness about the way we did communion. For us an “open” table was extremely important: if people wanted access to God through partaking in the breaking of the bread, then who were we to stop them? Our communion table became a table of healing where the broken could come, sit, and commune with God and others. For many years our big, square, purple table was set up in the middle of our gathering, symbolizing Jesus as our center rather than the band or the pulpit. On it sat several large loaves of bread, bottled wine, and grape juice. The community members were encouraged to come alone in their own time, or with someone else, and meet with God.

We have some deeply moving memories of times around the communion table. One such memory for Deb is a mental snapshot of the incredible diversity present around the table. On one particular day, sitting at the table breaking bread was a lady who had known Jesus her whole life. She was our oldest member, then in her eighties, and dressed in her lawn bowling outfit. Right next to her sat a naughty, very gay Jewish man with HIV-AIDS who was curious about Jesus. There were three others present—one married woman with four children currently going through a divorce, a speech pathologist who worked at a local hospital, and a former exotic dancer who had found Jesus in a bar. What a symbol of the broken, diverse body of Christ.

## Diverse-city

One final point we wish to make about faulty views of church is one many of us entertain: that the church is meant to be a high-conformity community. While none of us would consciously believe this, the way the majority of our communities are configured show this to be the case. It seems to us that the more religious we get, the more exclusive we tend to become. But the gospel undermines religion; it is for the world, and it won’t be narrowed down for our own private concerns. God wants to be all inclusive.

We have recently reread the book of Acts and noticed that it didn’t take long for the church to close in on itself, to lose its heart for mission beyond its cultural boundaries—boundaries which, left to their own devices, would get narrower and narrower. The church in Jerusalem quickly forgot the Great Commission to include the nations and needed a kick in the pants to get them out of their self-enclosed concerns (Acts 15). Peter had to have a direct vision from heaven for him to be able to grasp the fact implicit in the death of Christ: table fellowship can take place between the “clean” and the “unclean” (Acts 10:1–23). And Paul had a pretty direct confrontation with the religious “heavies” to ensure that the Gentiles were equal members of God’s household and didn’t need to submit to Jewish ritual to be included. It seems that the great ingathering of the nations is constantly being hindered by people with a sinful tendency to close ranks, thus marginalizing “outsiders” and people different from ourselves.

But when it does this, the church cannot resist becoming a high-conformity, culturally closed, and ultimately oppressive clique. The church (both local and universal) is meant to be a motley collection of imperfect people included in the family of God by means of God’s sheer grace (1 Cor. 1:26–31; 6:9–11; Ephesians 2). Dr. Seuss captures the hilarious variety that should make up God’s church when he says in *One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish*, “From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere.”

What we see in the event of the incarnation, that is, in the earthly life and ministry of Jesus, is a remarkable and unsettling cultural freedom. The incarnational character of the church’s mission means that the expanding church will also be wonderfully diverse. Our unity must be centered in Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. But the unity of Christian witness must never be defined as organizational or cultural uniformity.

The church that Jesus built was filled with spiritual desperados. And no church genuinely following the untamed way of Jesus could be a neat and tidy experience. Desperate people are rude, frantic, reckless, focused, and uncompromising in their desire to get what they want (Matt. 11:12). Someone who is desperate will crash through the veil of niceness. Mike Yaconelli reminds us, “The New Testament is filled with desperate people, people who barged into private dinners, screamed at Jesus until they had his attention, or destroyed the roof of someone’s house to get to him. People who are desperate for spirituality very seldom worry about the mess they make on their way to be with Jesus.” The church is meant to be one, holy, and, we would add, messy.

The untamed, love-revolution movement Jesus started was never meant to be a “nice,” high-conformity, culturally uniform collective like “The Borg,” that all-assimilating being in the Star Trek series. (Remember their slogan? “Resistance is futile; you will be assimilated.”) If we are to be genuinely untamed followers of Jesus, we will be holy nonconformists, captured by a vision of the world that will be when the kingdom of God is finally fulfilled.

If we truly follow Jesus, we will reject any status quo that has not fully adopted the vision of the kingdom of God—and which human situation has? Here is a vision of the church worth striving for! Christianity at its best has always been the major agent of change by rejecting the existing state of affairs in pursuit of something much holier. Theologian Richard Neuhaus is right to make the necessary connection with the church and the kingdom of God when he suggests that “our restless discontent should not [necessarily] be over the distance between ourselves and the first century Church but over the distance between ourselves and the Kingdom of God to which the Church then and now is the witness.” The kingdom of God “maddens” us with a vision of what God’s agenda is for his world—and it is therefore the driving agenda of the church.

We end this chapter with a powerful quote from missiologist Darrel Guder:

> In all of his relationships, Jesus broke through the boundaries of likes and dislikes, social proprietary and religious acceptability, that characterized Palestinian society in the first century. Incarnational witness, as it was practiced by Jesus, challenged the accepted patterns of interpersonal relationships and community formation. It began with Jesus’ own roots in Galilee, which marked him as a man from the margins. He was not identified with the religiously prominent and respected circles of his day. He came “from the wrong side of the tracks”. His choice of disciples continued the pattern of incarnational reversion of the acceptable structures of society. He called people to follow him who were ritually unclean (fishermen), nationally suspect (publicans), and politically dubious (zealots). He demonstrated the revolutionary character of the in-breaking reign of God by reaching out and touching lepers, by conversing publicly with women, healing the children of Gentiles, allowing prostitutes to touch him, and going to parties with acknowledged con men. The church he founded continued this revolutionary pattern of incarnational witness, although it struggled with the challenges it represented. The Jerusalem church had to be convinced that Samaritans could really become followers of Jesus. Philip was led to evangelize a eunuch, who could never have joined in the ritual worship of the Temple community in Jerusalem.
>
> ... From very early on, however, it was clear that the church was to challenge the world as a community in which there was “no longer Jew or Greek, slave or free, male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28).

## Practices

- **Adopt a freak:** Often, those seen as social misfits can give real insight to our own cultural narrowness and help us see God in a bigger way. One of the simple ways we can reach beyond our own cultural cliques and grow in awareness of the other is to begin to really encounter people we normally would not engage with.

- **Think about this statement:** “Every disciple carries within themselves the potential for world transformation.” Try and see yourself and the people around you in light of the stories of the “ordinary people” who make up the kind of movements that change the world.

- **Disciple not-yet-believers:** Try the approach suggested in this chapter of simply beginning to invest in the lives of your neighbors and workmates. Try to see them as disciples of Jesus who have not yet encountered Jesus, and see your task as to disciple them to become more like Jesus.

- **Ponder in what ways you exercise your God-given function as a priest:** This relates to the fact that you are commissioned at conversion and also that priests mediate the knowledge of God in Jesus. How can you step into that role more consistently?
