## Introduction

Having previously written about the strategic need for discipleship and disciple-making in *The Forgotten Ways*, and explored the spiritual dynamics of discipleship in *Untamed* (with my wife, Deb), I am often asked questions about this subject. Most of these questions reflect a significant lack of understanding concerning the meaning and significance of disciple-making, as well as a diminished ability to articulate its context (what is involved), its agenda (the end goal), and its practice (how to do it).

Frankly, I find this ignorance alarming. A fair reading of the New Testament clearly positions discipleship and disciple-making at the very heart of the church’s gospel mandate. Of all the things churches have preserved over 2,000 years—doctrinal quirks, inexplicable rituals, and marginal traditions—we have somehow all but forgotten the essential mandate to make disciples of all nations. How is this possible? How have we managed to remove almost all traces of one of the church's central practices and purposes?

It's a fair bet that most Christians are not even aware of a call to discipleship, and still fewer understand what it means to submit themselves to its joys and demands. This issue is critical for several reasons:

- Discipleship is intrinsic to the life and mission of the Church (see Matt. 28:19–20).
- Its absence is a root cause of many problems facing the contemporary Church.
- Obedience to Jesus’ explicit commands is central; how can we expect to be the Church Jesus intends if we neglect one of His core practices?

Over the years, I have found it necessary to talk about a distinctly missional understanding of discipleship. The need to even qualify the word "discipleship" shows just how far we have strayed from its biblical understanding, as if we could compartmentalize aspects of our calling.

The term *discipleship* ought to stand alone, carrying the full weight of biblical spirituality—defined by Jesus' own version of the *Shema* (Mark 12:28–31). If we truly grasped the theology and worldview of the *Shema*, we would recognize that mission is implied in loving God and our neighbor. Worship, mission, and discipleship are simply different dimensions of the same reality. To recover discipleship is to recover both true worship and mission.

If Dallas Willard was right in calling out the “non-discipleship of the church,” then perhaps a recovery of discipleship can lead to significant renewal in God’s people. Almost all of the Church’s current problems can be traced, at least in part, to a lack of clear understanding and practice of discipleship. This is a correctable issue: we must return to basics.

Discipleship must move us beyond privatized worship and "quiet times in quiet places," transforming mere admirers of Jesus into true followers. Admirers are hard to motivate and need constant entertainment; only real followers will make a lasting impact on the world.

## Chapter 1: The End Game?

While a comprehensive understanding of authentic discipleship has largely been extinguished, residual aspects still exist in many churches. These “vestiges,” though reductions of the vibrant New Testament model, retain some transformative power.

The most basic way contemporary churches treat discipleship is as an introduction to local church theology and culture, often through a 12-week study aimed at new believers. Here, discipleship appears as a membership class or fast-tracked catechism, which is inadequate for forming impactful Christians.

Some churches instead offer various “pathways to maturity,” encouraging spiritual disciplines, such as:

- Personal prayer ("quiet times"),
- Regular church attendance and small group participation,
- Bible reading and study,
- Voluntary church service.

However, these practices often feel optional, as if for those wishing to go "deeper" after praying the sinner’s prayer. Few churches offer more than this.

If God’s mission is to “sum up all things in Christ” (Eph. 1:10), then church attendance, quiet times, and random voluntarism are insufficient. While spiritual disciplines are necessary and should not be abandoned, our theology and practice of discipleship must move beyond erratic devotion. The Church frequently lacks both an adequate theology of discipleship and a sense of its end goal.

## Chapter 2: A Church Equal to the Task

For context, I have devoted much of my adult life to studying what makes highly transformative, missional movements tick—movements like the Early Church (before Constantine), Celtic missions, the Moravians, Early Methodists, Early Pentecostalism, Chinese House Churches, the Church in India, and more.

My core discovery? One demonstrably essential and irreplaceable key is an obsession with discipleship and disciple-making. Discipleship is foundational at every level; removing it from the equation ensures the movement never achieves its potential—or even exists.

Discipleship is critical because it is how Jesus works through His people. Mike Breen (of 3DM) provocatively argued that the missional church will fail if it does not prioritize discipleship. I agree. Any contemporary missional movement that neglects discipleship at its heart will not fulfill its kingdom potential. Discipleship is not a quick fix, but it is the only long-term solution to much that ails our churches.

## Reframing Evangelism Within Discipleship

If we agree that the Church needs a strategic recovery of discipleship, we must then consider how this shapes evangelism—one irreplaceable aspect of the church’s global witness.

A provocative thesis: The key to church health, extension, and renewal is NOT more evangelism, but more discipleship. In fact, our current approaches to evangelism may be blocking our ability to fulfill the real job—disciple-making. More of the same event-based evangelism will not solve problems, and may make them worse. When we aim at evangelism as it is currently understood, we rarely, if ever, arrive at discipleship. This reality is nowhere more obvious than in our age of mass consumption. The real solution is to refocus on discipleship and allow evangelism to take place within that context.

> What has got us here is not going to get us there.  
> — Paraphrase of common wisdom

We must unlearn certain approaches if we are to advance the cause of Christ. Most Western evangelicals equate "evangelism" with certain settled, formulaic practices—never questioning if this understanding serves the mission. We must rethink evangelism, especially the unexamined assumption that the Great Commission is synonymous with outreach events and altar calls.

## Chapter 3: Hear O Israel

Let us re-examine the Great Commission:

> "And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the end of the age.'"  
> — Matthew 28:18–20 (RSV)

A fresh reading reveals:

1. **Universal Mission:** Jesus, with all authority, sends his apostles with a global mission. This is the redemptive purpose of God through His church—a "pay-it-forward" movement.
2. **Apostolic Seed:** The apostles represent the Church that will emerge from their ministry, and the Great Commission applies to all believers, at all times.
3. **Disciple-Making Mandate:** The clear command is to “make disciples,” expecting disciples to reproduce themselves through discipling others.
4. **Baptism into God’s Family:** The apostles are to baptize into the name of the Triune God—a radically inclusive act—and teach obedience to Jesus' commands. Obedience, not mere decision or prayer, is the expected response.
5. **Promise of Presence:** Jesus’ ongoing presence empowers all who engage in this commission.

Notably, evangelism is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. Instead, the text binds us to the practices of discipleship and disciple-making. Evangelism is implied in the process and context of making disciples—not the other way around. The church growth movement’s focus on event-based proclamation is thus built on a reductionist reading of this commission, narrowing the vision and diminishing the mission.

## Chapter 4: Go Make Consumers of All Nations?

The church growth movement, epitomized by the Willow Creek REVEAL study, has acknowledged, “We’re good at getting decisions for Christ, but not so great at making disciples.” This honesty is commendable.

By and large, the evangelism of the church growth era catered to consumerism, appealing to the consumer habits of Westerners. For most, consumerism is more akin to a prevailing religion than a mere economic system. In fact, shopping malls serve as sites of spiritual seeking—striving for meaning, significance, and belonging.

> What you win them with, you win them to.

If we use entertainment to attract, we must continue entertaining to retain. This is an unsustainable burden, and consumptive methods do not produce obedient followers of Jesus. Instead, discipleship—rooted in loyalty to our covenant King—must confront the idolatries of our age, especially consumerism.

One cannot consume their way into the Kingdom. The way of salvation is through the cross: surrender, not self-fulfillment. If discipleship is central to the mission (Matt. 28:16–20), we have no right to remove it from evangelism. To add discipleship and obedience only after a conversion event smacks of a fraudulent, bait-and-switch strategy.

### Begin With the End in Mind; End With the Beginning

This inconsistency demands correction. Proper alignment around discipleship will bring integrity and renewal. Discipleship must be central from beginning to end.

Importantly, reframing our approach does **not** mean ceasing to share the Good News. Rather, evangelism happens naturally as we make disciples. As we disciple nations, evangelism occurs within its appropriate context.

---

## Pre-Conversion Discipleship

One simple recalibration: recognize that conversion is a process that begins even before formal regeneration. Discipleship should start before a person becomes a Christian and continue afterward. Evangelism happens along the way as we share life and faith.

Consider Jesus himself: when, precisely, were His disciples “born again”? At the start of the Gospels? The end? Most would say it was later—perhaps with the resurrection or Pentecost. Yet, these followers were being discipled before their formal conversion, participating in ministry and learning from Jesus.

Similarly, early Church practice (100–300 A.D.) required seekers—“catechumens”—to demonstrate commitment by living the ethics of Jesus under the guidance of a sponsor, often for years, before being baptized or fully included. Discipleship started long before formal conversion.

These early practices were not what we would call "seeker-sensitive," yet they transformed societies because they took disciple-making seriously and would not tolerate consumerism.

## Chapter 5: Reimagining Evangelism

To reimagine evangelism through the lens of discipleship, we must let go of seeing salvation as something that happens on demand or by reciting a formulaic prayer. Instead, discipleship is a process that includes both pre- and post-conversion phases. Ultimately, a person’s salvation is God’s business; our job is to commit ourselves to making disciples of whomever wishes to journey with us.

We need not rush to present formulas in unnatural or forced ways. If we love Jesus and the people we engage, the Good News will surface naturally. The Holy Spirit awakens interest in those being called.

**Example:**  
You know your neighbor Jack. As a disciple-maker, you might say, "Jack, I want to help you achieve your greatest dreams." If Jack agrees, meaningful conversations will follow, eventually uncovering his deepest longings and fears. In time, God will work in Jack's life; but even after he gives his life to Jesus, discipleship must continue.

Discipleship may begin with generic mentoring and shift toward a more explicitly Christ-centered focus as time goes on, always proceeding in loving, relational fashion.

**Case Study - Soma Communities:**  
Soma Communities in Tacoma, WA, led by Jeff Vanderstelt, practice a lifelong process of gospel integration. In the pre-conversion phase, discipleship includes evangelism, and after conversion, the emphasis shifts but the journey continues.

**Case Study - The Engel Scale:**  
Missiologists describe the journey to faith and maturity using the Engel Scale, which traces stages from pre-conversion to +6 as a disciple. Reframing mission and evangelism around discipleship fosters deep, authentic relationships—key to credible witness.

**Case Study - Community Christian Church & NewThing Network:**  
Community Christian Church in Chicago, founded by Dave and Jon Ferguson, launched the NewThing Network to catalyze reproducing churches "relentlessly dedicated to helping people find their way back to God." They view everyone as returning to God and design their ministries for disciple-making, using "apprenticeship" to emphasize lifelong learning.

The movement, now around 50,000 strong, grows rapidly, proving that prioritizing disciple-making can result in vibrant church growth. However, the motive isn't mere pragmatism—we do this because it is right and is Jesus’ command.

**Historical Movements:**  
World-changing movements—the Early Church, Celts, Moravians, Methodists, the Chinese underground church—have always prioritized discipleship. Recalibrating around it is not a quick fix, but a strategic, long-term commitment.

## Chapter 6: It’s All About Jesus. No, Really, It Is.

Michael Frost and I stated in *ReJesus* that many of the Church’s ailments trace to a deficient understanding and engagement with Jesus. A correction at this point—our Christology—promises the best chance of renewal.

Nowhere is this truer than in discipleship. New Testament Christianity is defined by engagement with God in Christ, not a generic idea of God. Diminishing the centrality of Jesus leads to a loss of our distinct calling as disciples.

Too often, Western Christianity emphasizes Jesus’ saving work on the cross while minimizing His words, actions, and radical call. We seek to domesticate Him, separating His salvation from His Lordship. This is a dangerous heresy.

**Discipleship is about Christ being formed in you and you being formed in Christ.** His humanity shows us what we are to become (see Rom. 8:28–30; 2 Cor. 3:12–18; 1 John 2:5–6). Evangelicals rightfully embrace Jesus as Savior, but too easily neglect His call to follow as Lord and example. The Gospel is both: Jesus as Savior **and** Lord.

> “[D]iscipleship means adherence to Christ and, because Christ is the object of that adherence, it must take the form of discipleship. An abstract theology, a doctrinal system, a general religious knowledge of the subject of grace or the forgiveness of sins, render discipleship superfluous, and in fact exclude any idea of discipleship whatsoever, and are essentially inimical to the whole conception of following Christ ... Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Christianity without discipleship, and Christianity without discipleship is always Christianity without Christ.”
>
> — Dietrich Bonhoeffer, *The Cost of Discipleship*

### To Bring All Things Together in Christ

Why stress Christology in a book on discipleship? Because in the end, everything is about Jesus. Discipleship is the way we show we take Jesus—His incarnation, works, words, life, commands, and commissions—seriously.

> “It is easy to think that the Church has a lot of different objects—education, buildings, missions, holding services ... the Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time. God became man for no other purpose. It is even doubtful, you know, whether the whole universe was created for any other purpose. It says in the Bible that the whole universe was made for Christ and that everything is to be gathered together in Him.”
>
> — C.S. Lewis, *Mere Christianity*

A church that takes discipleship seriously takes Jesus and the Gospel seriously; a church that neglects this non-negotiable aspect of faith misses the point—dangerously.

## Conclusion

This book aims to:

1. **Highlight the missional and theological significance of discipleship.**
2. **Help you reframe your understanding and practice of evangelism in this light.**

Much is at stake. Our engagement with the living Jesus is perhaps the most important reason to make disciple-making our highest priority. Discipleship is not optional; it is adhesion to Jesus and the formative process by which we live His ministry in the world.

In light of these truths, it is imperative that we rethink our inherited practices—starting by reframing evangelism in the context of discipleship. This is not merely strategic; it is obedience to Christ's command:

> "And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the end of the age.'"  
> — Matthew 28:18–20 (RSV)
