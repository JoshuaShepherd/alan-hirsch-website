---so we create hierarchies. But the organic approach is more to create heir-archies where you are all fellow heirs to the grace of God.”6 What Should We Do Instead? Gerard Kelly, in his timely book RetroFuture, takes issue with the current conception of church when he says, “I believe the church must change. The church is not trend-driven; it is God’s family and lives by other rules. But it is also a cultural and social institution, rooted in a given place and time. If we have any concern for the rising generations—and for those who will follow them—we must look with urgency to the future shape of our church.”7 He goes on to quote Tom Sine’s oft-rehearsed warning, “Every denomination and religious organization I have worked with does long-range planning. Ironically, they do long-range planning as though the future will simply be an extension of the present. As a result, we are chronically surprised by change. In the future, we can no longer a!ord this luxury.”8 So, what will the future shape of the church look like? If it takes the form we propose for the missional church, it will look vastly varied in its many different contexts. But we can be sure that there will be some common values across the board. It will place a high value on communal life, more open leadership structures, and the contribution of all the people of God. It will be radical in its attempts to embrace biblical mandates for the life of locally based faith communities without feeling as though it has to reconstruct the first-century church in every detail. We believe the missional church will be adventurous, playful, and surprising. Leonard Sweet has borrowed the term “chaordic” to describe the missional church’s inclination toward chaos and improvisation within the constraints of broadly held biblical values. It will gather for sensual-experiential-participatory worship and be deeply concerned for matters of justice-seeking and mercy-bringing. It will strive for a type of unity-in-diversity as it celebrates individual di!erences and values uniqueness, while also placing a high premium on community. Bishop Gladwin, expressed in his book on the postmodern church, believes that the emerging missional church will have these four features in common: focus on the journey of faith and the experience of God; desire for less structure and more direct involvement by participants; sense of flexibility in order and a distinctly nonhierarchical culture; recognition that the experience of church is about the sustaining of discipleship. He concludes, “So the church will focus on core faith, on minimum essential order, on people and their gifts, on flexible patterns of life held together in communion and on a shared sense of community.”9 And this from a bishop! We appreciate that working models are often more informative than theoretical ones. What follows are a few case studies of the missional church around the world. Church in the Missional Mode When Tim and Kristy Cobillas set out to begin a church in the northern landscape of Saint Louis, Missouri, in 2001, they had no idea that it would evolve into an outlaw biker haven. Joshua House began as an informal worship gathering around a backyard bonfire on a two-acre plot of suburban wilderness that included Tim and Kristy’s house and a converted two-story garage that served as a sort of clubhouse and worship sanctuary all in one. Tim’s “real job” as a motorcycle builder kept him connected to the biker culture throughout the years, and as Joshua House began to develop into a community of faith, more and more of Tim’s clients began showing up around the campfire. The presence of so many bikers caused Tim to eventually found and lead the Faithful Few, an outlaw Christian motorcycle club. The Faithful Few is not a collection of middle-age suburban dads living out their Wild Hogs fantasies on the weekends. Far from it. These guys are the real deal. Tim shared with us that just a couple of days before we visited with him, he had baptized an outlaw biker he had been cultivating a relationship with for five years. This particular biker was known as an enforcer. We will leave the definition of that title to your imagination. Tim points out, “When these dudes come to Christ, they do so radically. They are radical cats, and just as radical as they were in the outlaw biker lifestyle, they go just as hard for Christ.” One of his hardest jobs in discipling outlaw biker converts is for them not to “enforce” Christ upon their unconverted buddies. The objective is to create a circle of relationships among guys who have lived the outlaw biker life and want to become faithful and committed followers of Christ while still living in the biker culture. Tim stresses that Joshua House is not a biker church per se. “We don’t look at bikers as tokens for us to claim or highlight. But they have found a refuge and a community here.” Joshua House is made up of an eclectic mix of straight-laced college students, middle-aged couples, single moms, and the biker crowd. It would be a gross understatement to say a Sunday morning at Joshua House is not your normal church service. Depending on the season, folks gather either outside nearby the organic garden and campfire or inside the downstairs clubhouse for pancakes, bagels, or other breakfast fare. Eventually the whole troop makes its way to the upper room for singing, prayer, and a typical sermon type of teaching. Joshua House has no website or advertising other than the lives of its people who live to incarnate the message of the gospel in the midst of a culture that is somewhat hostile to the Christian idea. Speaking of the combination of Joshua House and the Faithful Few, Tim says, “We are an armpit in the body of Christ. We are not just an everybody church. We are an anybody church. Jesus went out and invited the tax collectors and outcasts to join him. We do the same thing.” This is missional church thinking. Instead of planting a traditional, attractional church, Tim and Kristy engage in the very rhythms and life of a host culture to genuinely listen to their hopes and fears. A similar experiment The Missional Church 41 is the Hope Community in Wolverhampton, England. Three Roman Catholic sisters were asked by their parish church to conduct a community survey in Heath Town, an impoverished public housing project comprising nine highrise buildings. They began simply by listening to the voices of the community. What they heard was a litany of despair, pain, and great social need. Unable to continue the “survey” and then return to their comfortable chapter house in a nearby middle-class suburb, they rented an apartment on the third floor of one of the bleak towers. There, they continued their regular life of community and prayer, making themselves much more available to the local people. The missional church assumes that proximity to a host community is essential. Interestingly, as Sister Margaret Walsh reports it, none of the sisters set out to initiate anything.10 They simply lived with and listened to their neighbors. But their gracious presence catalyzed many social changes. Housing project church services have begun, planned and led by local people. The sisters o!er computer courses and literacy training, and have hosted holiday events—all contributing greatly to an improved quality of life for the residents. The integrity of their community and the power of their sense of mission have been salt and light in the public housing community. While the sisters resist calling what they’re doing “church,” the rest of the community clearly identify the nuns’ apartment as their chapel. Like Tim and Kristy, the sisters have not come to impose anything on their host community. But by being Christ in the midst of their respective people groups, they make the assumption that God is already present and already touching peoples’ lives. They don’t presume to “bring” God to St. Louis or to Heath Town, but they do desire to be used by the Spirit to transform individuals and cultures for Christ’s sake by the God who was already there. With these two working models as background, we are able to identify some of the shared traits that we observe in various missional churches. Four characteristics deserve special consideration: proximity spaces, shared projects, commercial enterprise, and emerging indigenous faith communities. By proximity spaces, we mean places or events where Christians and not-yetChristians can interact meaningfully with each other. Located in the small midwestern town of Newton, Kansas (population 15,000), is Norm’s Co!ee Bar. Robert Palmer began it as a place for people of a multiplicity of backgrounds to gather and experience community. He also Margaret Walsh, Urban Theology Unit, New City Special No. 8, 1991. pastors Stone Creek Community Church, which meets in the same building that houses Norm’s Co!ee Bar—but unless you knew the church also meets there, you would never know it. There are no church advertisements in the space. This is to say, the space has not been Christianized. It is neutral territory. Dreaming of a space that would promote the type of community evoked in the mythical Cheers, a Boston pub from the 1980s television show by the same name, Palmer’s team named the place Norm’s, after Cheers patron Norm Peterson, whose entry to the pub is routinely met with a group greeting of “Hi, Norm!” Robert said, “A bar is really a counterfeit for the church. Everybody is welcome. Everyone does know your name. They’re accepting. It doesn’t matter what your background is or where you’ve come from. And there is always someone to talk to who doesn’t judge you but just listens to your story. And the idea for us was to create Norm’s Co!ee ‘bar’ and to see if that could happen. And it has. Here, people come to us. And they just share their stories. I stand behind this counter and people open their hearts up.” Norm’s has become a public space being used by groups and organizations throughout the city, including the Chamber of Commerce. Around the world, Christians are developing cafés, nightclubs, art galleries, design studios, football teams, etc., to facilitate such proximity and interaction. If the church service is the only space where we can meaningfully interact with unbelievers, we’re in trouble. In Birmingham, England, Pip Piper, the founder of a design studio called One Small Barking Dog (great name!), runs a monthly gathering in a local café, the Medicine Bar. He has negotiated permission from the landlord to deck the premises out as a “spiritual space.” Using incense, projected images, and ambient religious music, he designed a spiritual zone he calls Maji, where artists who would normally patronize the Medicine Bar as well as invited friends can hang out, experience the ambience, and talk about faith, religion, and spirituality—it’s a classic proximity space. Second, missional church thinking values the development of shared or joint projects between the Christian community and its host community. Proximity spaces are excellent for casual interaction. Shared projects allow the Christians to partner with unbelievers in useful, intrinsically valuable activities within the community. In the context of that partnership, significant connections can be established. The church can initiate these shared projects though presented as a community-wide activity. Or the Christian community can simply get behind existing projects. The important thing is to find joint projects that put Christians and not-yet-Christians shoulder-to-shoulder in a lengthy partnership. The Missional Church 43 Time is an issue here. We need to find or develop projects that allow the time for important friendships to form. Allan Tibbels was a 26-year-old quadriplegic in the mid-1980s when he moved into Sandtown, one of the toughest neighborhoods in Baltimore. He and his wife Susan were inspired by the writings of evangelist and civil rights worker John M. Perkins to live incarnationally by moving into the ghetto. What they found in Sandtown was nothing but overpriced rental units, every one of them a firetrap leased by an absentee landlord. Transience, homelessness, and the constant threat of eviction were everyday experiences there. And yet the neighborhood was pockmarked by vacant lots. Even though he couldn’t move his arms or legs, Tibbels believed he could build a!ordable housing for his neighbors on this land. He turned to Habitat for Humanity for help. Although he knew nothing about housing and couldn’t swing a hammer himself, Tibbels scrounged enough donations and local volunteers to get a Habitat house built in 1990. Such was the response to this minor miracle across Baltimore that the funds for more houses began to flow and soon Tibbels announced he would build another hundred houses, with mortgages of about $300 a month, less than half the typical rent. Committed to partnering with the residents of Sandtown, Tibbels only hired from the neighborhood, which meant his sta! grew to include ex-cons, addicts, and dealers. It also meant that he lost something in building efficiency and excellence, but in its place grew love. Maybe it was Tibbel’s own brokenness that inspired the broken men and women of Sandtown to trust him in this foolhardy venture. As a result, over two decades, a man who couldn’t lift his arms built 286 houses. He also helped plant the New Song Community Church that grew out of the relationships Allan and Susan had built with their neighbors. One thousand people attended his funeral there in 2010, a service that saw politicians sitting next to drug dealers. The New York Times reported, “Someone once described Tibbels as ‘saving Sandtown,’ which made him wince. God saves; neighbors share.”11 While in San Francisco, we had the opportunity to take a walk through the Hispanic mission district with Mark Scandrette, a bohemian artist who moved to the Bay Area to plant a church. He has discovered that by joining the neighborhood mural co-op (one of the oldest in the country), he literally stands shoulder-to-shoulder with non-Christians as they apply paint to murals across the city. He can also have input into what shape public art takes in San Francisco. In cities without a strong culture of public art, a Christian Obituary, New York Times, cited: 24.12.10 http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/12/26/ magazine/2010lives.html#view=allan_tibbels. community might want to initiate such a cooperative. The missional church doesn’t immediately think in terms of strategies, but in terms of people and places. As Bono from U2 says, “If Jesus were on earth you’d find him in a gay bar in San Francisco. He’d be working with people su!ering from AIDS. These people are the new lepers. If you want to find out where Jesus would be hanging out it’ll always be with the lepers.” Third, commercial enterprise is important. Bringing positive and tangible change speaks volumes to the host community. If we come to plant a church in a particular area, we’re not perceived as doing anyone any favors. But if we’re starting a café, an internet launderette, or a day-care center, we’re seen as bringing some intrinsic value to a community. We’re serving those to whom we’re sent. In Sheffield, England, a woman named Jane Grinnoneau has established a community-based business called the Furnival in a derelict English pub of the same name. Her story is one of sheer hard work as well as the miraculous provision of God (a great combination). The Furnival pub had been stripped, vandalized, and abandoned by the time Jane came across it while wandering lost in the notorious Burngreave public housing project one day. How she acquired the building and fully fitted it out to meet the needs of the local community is a story of God’s miraculous grace. Now the Furnival is a skills center for local young people, with a training kitchen and café. There are plans for a launderette and a multiagency health and advice center. Burngreave was so nefarious that formal Christian witness had ended there when the Methodist Church finally pulled out years before Jane got there. If anyone had announced that they were planting another traditional church in the project, the local community would have wondered why and the denominational churches would have questioned the waste of resources. But the Furnival is a Christian community serving the host community and seeing the kingdom being extended in ways a conventional church could never have seen. Even at a denominational level, people are beginning to see the incarnational value of planting service industries within a host community. As Robert Palmer has discovered, the right local business can create significant and intimate relationships with people not normally interested in church-based programs. Fourth, indigenous faith communities ought to emerge from all this interaction with a host subculture. While it is a noble and, indeed, a godly activity The Missional Church 45 for a Christian businessman to run a shoe shop and to try to be Christ to his customers, something is missing if a Christian faith community isn’t part of the equation. The Christian businessperson can engage colleagues, clients, and customers in a discussion of faith questions, but the best hermeneutic of the gospel is a community of Christians living it out. Robert Palmer, Margaret Walsh, Allan Tibbels, Jane Grinnoneau, and Pip Piper have developed their proximity spaces and their commercial ventures as missionaries. Their desire is to see the kingdom come and to see lives transformed by the power of Christ. Some have already developed faith communities from their incarnational activities, while for others it is still early days. Some critics of the missional church ask, “When is the Bible taught? How do people learn doctrine?” We recognize these as valid questions. But we believe such learning takes place much more e!ectively when the Christian faith community is involved in active mission. Too much existing Bible teaching happens to passive groups of Christians, many of whom are not involved in any kind of risky missional activity. A missional church mobilizes all its members to be sent into the community. Like Jesus’ first followers discovered, learning occurs when we need to draw on information because a situation demands it. This isn’t to say that there shouldn’t be formal teaching times, but these formal occasions will allow the teaching to be related to the missional experience gained by the church itself. It is important to note that the missional church combines the concern for community development normally characterized by the liberal churches and the desire for personal and community transformation normally characterized by the evangelical movement. This blurring of the old lines of demarcation between theologies, doctrine, and ideology within the church makes the way open for much more integrated mission to occur. It’s like saying that we want to prepare like an evangelical; preach like a Pentecostal; pray like a mystic; do the spiritual disciplines like a Desert Father, art like a Catholic, and social justice like a liberal. In fact, we have found that among many missional church leaders and thinkers there is a concern to balance ideas that are normally considered opposites. It is called both/and thinking and has been a feature of the emergent postmodern culture. Missional church thinking allows the dialogue between liberation theology, which says context is everything, and the postliberals like Hauerwas and Brueggeman who say we need to get our story right. The missional church will take context seriously, but will also work on recovering the biblical narrative with its richness and potency for today’s world. When story and context are equally embraced, we are beginning to think and act missionally. In San Francisco, a group calling itself ReImagine has been meeting to explore how this dialogue works itself out practically. To do so, ReImagine refers to di!erent colored spaces. Yellow space refers to a Christian spirituality that is only concerned with the personal, interior world of faith. It characterizes the classic individualized form of faith that focuses on personal quiet times, Bible study, church attendance, and personal moral/ethical behavior. Blue space refers to an exclusively other-focused form of Christian spirituality, one that takes context seriously and features such activities as social concern, justice-seeking, activism, and public moral/ethical behavior. It is only in the dialogue between them, says ReImagine, that we come close to biblical missional activity and spirituality, as illustrated by the diagram below: Yellow Space Green Space Blue Space Since the combination of yellow and blue on the color chart does make green, it’s a clever way to think about missional spaces. They are green spaces. And missional Christians might rightly be referred to as green people. In a green space, story and context, the individual and the communal, the interior world and the exterior world, the religious and the non-religious, find genuine meeting. At ReImagine references to green people and green spaces are common. In sleepy suburban Pomona in Los Angeles, the front lawns are freshly cut and their edges trimmed. The streetlights glow a warm amber hue throughout the quiet evenings. Street signs announce that Pomona is a neighborhoodwatch zone and tell would-be intruders that, “We report any suspicious persons or activities to our police department.” But on downtown Second Street, something’s up! Some years ago Second Street was transformed into an Arts Colony (an imposing sign over the street announces it as such), and now there are a number of dance venues, nightclubs, art studios, and hip clothing stores. There is a college of the arts in town, and Second Street is crawling with bohemians, punks, hip-hoppers, taggers, and performance artists. Posters in windows advertise everything from acting classes to stained The Missional Church 47 glass making, poetry readings, and mosaic table workshops. When we were visiting Pomona, there was a “Beginning Wicca” workshop and a panel discussion on “Woman in the Arts” happening that night. Music styles available in the various venues include blues, hip-hop, rock, house, punk, rockabilly, and Latino. Right in the middle of this carnivalesque atmosphere of art and music, new age religion, and commercialism we discovered the Millennia Co-op at 181 Second Street. Although it no longer exists we found it’s cohesion in the community o!ered several wonderful elements of a faith collective existing as servant to the host community. It was the brainchild of the radical missionaries John Jensen and the late Brian Ollman, and was a mission experiment that combined proximity spaces, shared projects, business enterprises, and indigenous faith communities. Their mission statement read, “The Millennia Co-op advances cultural renewal and personal transformation through the integration of the arts, community, spirituality, business and public service. The Millennia Co-op consists of several inter-connected projects, all centered in the Pomona Arts Colony. Each Millennia Co-op project provides opportunities for creative expression, employment and connecting in a healing community centered around Jesus.” Each Millennia Co-op project was designed to incorporate one or more of the four features we mention above. Millennia art lounge: The Lounge was the Millennia Co-op’s storefront project (literally). A street level store right on Second Street, converted into a performance space/dance venue hosting a weekly poetry night, live bands, hip-hop music, and house music events. All these regular events o!ered free or low cost and providing an alcohol-and drug-free space for a diverse group of young people to hang out and create community. The Millennia Lounge also hosted occasional art exhibitions as local artists, including the homeless, could gain exposure to their work and expression (note: proximity space, with an element of shared project). Millennia art studio: This space o!ered beginning and experienced artists a place to create together in a community environment. Free studio space was available, as were art workshops and vocational training courses. The artists who used the studio (Christians and not-yet-Christians) occasionally took their work to the streets by producing murals and art installations to beautify the city. It’s from the studio that much of the work for the exhibitions in the Lounge came (note: shared project and proximity space). Millennia design group: Established in an open-plan office in a loft above the Lounge, the lab specialized in creative graphic designs that attracted customers from an assortment of businesses in Pomona and beyond. It produced business cards, websites, letterheads, and other business collateral (note: business enterprise). Innerworld: Millennia’s electronic dance culture collective, hosting a weekly house music event in the Lounge and also making a positive impact on the host community through projects like picking up trash and serving the homeless (note: shared project). Millennia JiuJitsu: In the front of the basement under the Lounge, there were weekly jiujitsu wrestling classes promoting community relationships and personal fitness (note: business enterprise and proximity space). Ichthus: At the core of the Millennia Co-op, an indigenous faith community called Ichthus. Originally one small group meeting in Brian Ollman’s home, grew to three cell churches and continued to burgeon. Members of the church shared responsibility for several of the Millennia projects, and the leadership network (not elected, merely recognized) met regularly to consider the future direction of the mission. Those members of Ichthus that we met saw their involvement as that of missionaries. The people who came to Ichthus and then made a commitment to Christ were first accessed through the Lounge or jiujitsu or the Studio. In fact, some of those who came to Christ had been about as far from the church as Western kids could be. We don’t present the Pomona experiment as the way forward nor as the only expression of the missional church. It is one of the forms the missional church takes, and there will be as many forms as there are subcultures or people groups or neighborhoods to reach. And we applaud the courage, tenacity, and creativity shown by Brian and his team in getting something as e!ective as the Millennia Co-op launched. It was genuinely green space. Incarnational, Messianic, Apostolic What we propose is a reversing of the three mistakes made by the Christendommode church. The missional church, by its very nature, will be an anticlone of the existing traditional model. Rather than being primarily attractional, it will be incarnational. It will be willing to leave its own comfortable religious zones and live in direct contact with non-churchgoers, seeping into the host The Missional Church 49 culture like salt and light. It will be an infiltrating, transformational community. Second, rather than being dualistic, it will embrace a messianic spirituality. That is, a spirituality of engagement with culture and the world in the same mode as the Messiah himself. And third, the missional church will develop an apostolic form of leadership rather than the traditional hierarchical model. We will explore each of these modes of being missional in the following three sections of this book. In fact, we prefer the term mode to that of model. We are not commending a new model at all. The church is surely tiring of the latest model being o!ered by church-growth theorists. As we just pointed out, the missional church will value diversity and should look significantly di!erent depending on which subculture it has felt called to serve. # P A R T T W O Ivan Illich was once asked what is the most revolutionary way to change society. Is it violent revolution or is it gradual reform? He gave a careful answer. Neither. If you want to change society, then you must tell an alternative story, he concluded. —Tim Costello Reinventing the Church We recently saw the cover of a book about reinventing the church that’s an icon of just what we think is wrong with the post-Christendom church. It depicts a classic church building, replete with a tall steeple, long stained glass windows, and a white picket fence. Leaning over the building from behind is a giant man in a white, long-sleeved shirt and a tie (we think he’s meant to be a minister—very clean cut) and a gigantic wrench in his hand. He is tightening a huge bolt on the front of the steeple. When we talk about reinventing the church, too many people assume it’s as simple as tightening a bolt here, oiling a hinge there, slapping on a new coat of paint. But we are proposing a monumental change to the way we think about being and doing church. All the tinkering with the existing model of church that’s going on will not save the day. Simply making minor adjustments like replacing pews with more comfortable seating, or singing contemporary pop songs instead of hymns will not reverse the fundamental decline in the fortunes of the Western church. If you think of the church as a car, we cannot simply take it in for service. We need a whole new model. Or think of the church as a DVD player. If you have newer Blu-ray system, you can’t play them on your old DVD player—you need an entirely di!erent device. As we pointed out in the previous chapter, we believe this new mode should be incarnational, messianic, and apostolic. We will turn our attention now to the first of these primary aspects of the missional church. Coming to Grips with Being Incarnational For us the Incarnation is an absolutely fundamental doctrine, not just as an irreducible part of the Christian confession, but also as a theological prism through which we view our entire missional task in the world. So when we talk of incarnational mission, we hope to, in some real way, directly draw inspiration and motivation from that unique act whereby God entered into our world and into the human condition in the person of Jesus Christ. Some reflection on this unique event is therefore necessary before we can draw out some of the profound implications that this should have on our engagement with the world in which we live. When we talk of the Incarnation with a capital I we refer to that act of sublime love and humility whereby God took it upon himself to enter into the depths of our world, our life, and our reality in order that the reconciliation and consequent union between God and humanity may be brought about. This “enfleshing” of God is so radical and total that it is the bedrock upon which rests all subsequent acts of God in his world. A halfway house on the way to God would not do for a lost humanity, and so God had to come down to man, not halfway but the whole way. To say that this event is fundamental to a true conception of the Christian faith is surely an understatement. Without it, the work of Jesus lacks its redemptive merit. Orthodox Christian belief rightly stresses that the atonement is directly linked to Christ’s divinity and to his humanity. Jesus had to be God to be able to lift us out of our sin, but had to be fully human to create the right conditions for such redemption to take place. It is from inside the human condition and experience that God fulfills his own requirements for the salvation of the human race. Therefore we rightly confess that God is love, and that this is a love that has resolutely pursued us to the point at which it overtakes us—in the depths of our sin and lostness. Thus the course of human sin determines the history of God’s love. While recognizing that in the Incarnation we are dealing with something of a holy mystery and a paradox that in some ways is inexplicable, we wish The Incarnational Approach 55 to highlight here some of the theological implications for us to consider in the context of this book. Identification: The Incarnation embodies an act of profound identification with the entire human race. The medium is entirely the message. The human form which God takes in Jesus is no mere outer garment, like a beggar-cloak of a king who dresses up in order to seek out the love of a beggar-girl in the local village, a garment that flutters loosely about him and so betrays his real status as a king. No, rather it is his true form and figure. In an act of unspeakable humility, God actually takes upon himself all the conditions, even the limitations, the struggles, and the doubts of humanity (Phil. 2:6–8; Heb. 5:7–8). And it is God’s distinct greatness that in Jesus his love encompasses not just the great and the strong, but even the smallest—all of the little and inconsequential people who su!er in their quiet corners. Nothing is so small that he overlooks it. That is the extent to which God becomes human—the extent to which he loves us and wills to experience unconditionally what it means to be human. Therefore we can believe in his love and be sure that he is completely for us. Locality: It has been said, “If we want to make a thing real we must make it local.” That is precisely what God did in Jesus Christ—the divine love took on a local habitation and a name. The coming of God among us was not just a momentary theophany, but constituted an actual “dwelling” among us (John 1:14). In the light of such a dwelling, place—geography itself—took on a sacred meaning: He became known as Jesus of Nazareth. It is interesting to ponder whether Nazareth itself, a poor town in ancient Israel, actually had a role in the formation of Jesus and, through him, the world. To be theologically true to the meaning of the humanity of Jesus, we have to recognize that Jesus was who he was, not only because he was God, but because he was formed through his real engagement with his social milieu. As an authentic human being, Jesus was Jesus precisely because of Mary and Joseph, his twelve disciples, the poor to whom he ministered, and all the others who interacted with him in the myriad ways common to human life. He was changed in some way by all those he came in contact with in precisely the same way that we are changed by our relationships—for good or ill. To be a genuine human being, Jesus must have had such relational encounters, and to continue as a person (as he indeed still is), he must somehow retain them. If this is not true, then his humanity was a sham, a make-believe. And so the life of God incarnate in Jesus could not be locked secretly within his heart; rather it became a spreading complex of personal being centered in Jesus and annexing his companions. This, as we will see, has massive implications for the way in which we engage our world and the people around us. The Beyond-in-the-midst (2 Cor. 5:19): Here resides the paradox at the heart of the Incarnation. The eternal transcendent God was and is right here, in our midst. In Jesus, God came into direct personal contact with the human race which he so loves. He was/is not “above” us any longer. He is one of us. The presence of God in Jesus will henceforth define God’s mission to the world. Those who seek God will now find him in Jesus the man. The Incarnation is an event in heaven as well as on earth. In Jesus, God meets each of us personally. Henceforth all people, whoever they are and whenever or wherever they live, have the possibility of a personal relationship with God. The Human image of God (Col. 1:15): It has been noted that in the light of the New Testament, the remarkable truth is not so much that Jesus is Godlike, but rather that God is actually Christlike. (God is Christlike and in him is no un-Christlikeness at all.) In the light of the New Testament revelation, all who would wish to know who God is and what he is like need look no further than the person of Jesus (John 1:18; 14:9). From now on, all true perspectives of God must pass through the very particular lens of the man called Jesus of Nazareth. To say this more technically, all theology must now be understood through Christology. The genius of this aspect of New Testament revelation is that in Jesus God provides for us the basis of all imitation of him. From our perspective as human beings Jesus becomes the reference point for all genuine knowing, all true loving, and all authentic following of God. This, too, will have massive implications on the church’s life and mission. The above points are only a poor attempt to outline some of the theological implications of the enfleshing of God as we perceive them. And we have outlined them here to somehow trace ways that we believe the Incarnation should inform our mission in God’s world—how we, as the fruit of God’s Incarnation, should ourselves be and become incarnational. When we use the word incarnational (and we do all the way through this book), we use it in such a way as to gather up all or any of these motifs into the concept. We believe it must define and change the way we do mission in any context. First, the Incarnation provides us with the missional means by which the gospel can become a genuine part of a people group without damaging the innate cultural frameworks that provide that people group with a sense of meaning and history. David Bosch is right when he notes that “it should not bother us that during di!erent epochs the Christian faith was perceived and The Incarnational Approach 57 experienced in new and di!erent ways. The Christian faith is intrinsically incarnational.”1 Therefore unless the church actively resists the demands of incarnational mission, it must always enter fully into the context in which it happens to find itself. To birth, for instance, a full-fledged denominational church with all its associated Western-style liturgies, symbolic system, and worldview in the middle of Africa is a distortion of the incarnational principle of mission. The same is true for every missional context, including that of our now profoundly tribalized Western cultures. Thus the incarnational criteria must guide the church’s cultural expression in all its diverse contexts. Second, incarnational mission will mean that in reaching a people group we will need to identify with them in all ways possible without compromising the truth of the gospel itself. The power implicit in this act of identification is forcefully portrayed in movies with religious themes like Of Gods and Men, The Mission, The City of Hope, and Romero. It is also a grand theme in mythology and in general literature precisely because there is a great “magic” in it. There is a mysterious power that is unleashed in the act of becoming part of a people group for the sake of the gospel. Why? Because it involves a personal “buy-in,” a partaking, a stakeholding, and a real sympathy. And it is a powerful tool for mission in any context. For instance, for the members of Urban Neighbours of Hope (UNOH) in Melbourne and the InnerCHANGE workers in San Francisco, identification with the poor is an absolutely fundamental principle to their mission among the poor. All the missionaries and workers in these two missionary orders voluntarily live under the poverty line and refuse to be paid by their organizations for their work among the poor lest the people say, “You are paid to be kind to us.” They choose to live like the people with all the struggles and problems that poverty creates for people without power and resources. This incarnational act not only creates credibility for the missionaries, but it thus creates the relational-social context within which they can meaningfully and humanly share their faith. Because it means that for all intents and purposes, they have actually become part of the people group that they are trying to reach and have thereby overcome a very significant cultural barrier to the communication of the gospel. To identify incarnationally with a people will mean that we must try to enter into something of the cultural life of a “people”; to seek to understand their perspectives, their grievances and causes, in other words their real existence, in such a way as to genuinely reflect the act of identification that God made with us in Jesus. But the practice of incarnational identification with a group of people should not be limited to work among the poor. We insist that in some ways it should apply to all forms of genuine mission whatever the context. Not only because it “works” but because it somehow reflects that primal act of identification that was an intrinsic part of Christ’s Incarnation. It is because of this that incarnational identification retains its inherent gospel power to transform the myriad subcultural tribes that now face us in our task of mission in the West. The great danger in failing to practice mission incarnationally is cultural imperialism. This form of imperialism, itself a sin, is easily observed in so many countries where Western missionaries import without critical reflection their cultural forms of the gospel and impose them on a people group. Even though conversions often result, the long-term outcome is the loss of a genuinely local, indigenous culture. The Christians of that group appear to be more like wannabe westerners than genuine incarnational expressions of the Christian faith among their own people group. The “church” thereby becomes an isolated, somewhat alien body in the midst of a people. And with this demise of a shared culture, there sadly comes an overall loss of meaning and connectedness. Perhaps the worst result is, however, that the gospel, which itself cannot be understood apart from a shared meaning system (culture), cannot thereby sustain itself organically and meaningfully among the original people group over the long term because the relational connection is severed. Thus, short-term success gives way to long-term ine!ectiveness, leading us to believe that all non-incarnational (excarnational?) missions are in the end self-defeating. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that so many missionary e!orts have failed—in that so many missionaries, indeed the church itself, remained aliens to the target group rather than being an incarnated presence with all that this implies. What is now clear to us about non-Western contexts is also becoming appallingly clear regarding our own context. We so easily impose a cultural form on the people and the groups we hope to reach with the love of Jesus. We so often make the gospel synonymous with a bland middle-class conformity and thereby alienate countless people from encountering Christ. How often have we seen public opinion polls that reflect the attitude of “Jesus, Yes! Church, No!” Third, incarnational mission implies a real and abiding incarnational presence among a group of people. Quite simply, it means that if you want to reach the local gangstas, you are going to have to live where they live and hang out where they hang out. Or it might mean that if you want to plant a church in a given suburb, you should really think about living there. Why? Because you cannot become part of the organic life of a given community if you are not present to it and do not experience its cultural rhythms, its life, The Incarnational Approach 59 and its geography. The idea of incarnational presence corresponds to the idea of locality that was outlined above in our reflections on the Incarnation. Jesus moved into the neighborhood; he experienced its life, its rhythms, and its people from the inside and not as an outsider. It is sobering to think that for thirty years Jesus practiced this presence before he actually started his ministry. Nazareth had indeed become a living part of him and defined him in so many unaccountable ways. If this was so for Jesus, then, we believe, we, too, need to practice the missional discipline of presence and identification with any of the groups and people we hope to engage with. This is true whether they are the local ravers or members of bohemian art cooperatives, sports clubs, common interest groups, or parent groups—we need to identify a whole lot more before we can expect to really share Jesus in a meaningful way with them. Fourth, in terms of its missional stance in relation to context, incarnational mission implies a sending impulse rather than an extractional one. The New Testament impulse of mission is therefore centrifugal rather than centripetal.2 God is a missionary—he sent his Son into our world, into our lives, into human history. Incarnation therefore implies some form of sending in order to be able to radically incarnate into the various contexts in which disciples live. And while not all of us are called to cross-cultural forms of mission, we do believe that all of us are called to some form of incarnational expression of faith. We are not all meant to look and sound alike in every context! We are not meant to be part of a stifling monoculture. And why is this so? Because mission is always conditioned by that act whereby God reached out to us in a meaningful way when he moved into our neighborhood. We will have more to say about the missional mode of the Christendom church as being “attractional-extractional” in the pages to come, and so we leave the argument until then. But, suffice to say at this point that, in our opinion, the vast majority of churches in the West engage their contexts in an attractional, and therefore extractional, way. We believe that this insight provides a clue into why so much of our outreach and evangelism in the US, UK, and Australia actually ends up being ine!ective and self-defeating. We believe that this situation must change if we are to be faithful witnesses in the new millennium. And finally, incarnational mission means that people will get to experience Jesus on the inside of their culture (meaning systems) and their lives because of our embodying the gospel in an incarnationally appropriate way. For us, this is perhaps the most important aspect to consider in our attempts to genuinely re-evangelize the Western world. If Jesus has become so unfamiliar to most people, perhaps it is because he is perceived by many as a tame “churchgoer” and a teacher of moralistic platitudes. Most attitudinal research on the subject indicates that in terms of the public perception of outsiders (the “unchurched”), to become a Christian is synonymous with becoming a somewhat happy but bland, usually white, almost always middle-class, middle-of-the-road kind of person. This kind of person is exemplified by Ned Flanders in Matt Groenig’s immensely popular and insightful cultural critique, The Simpsons. One might well say that Ned is a caricature, but if he is, it only serves to exaggerate the reality that underlies all caricaturing. Ned Flanders is all too real to allow us to be at all comfortable. The problem we face is that this is precisely the way in which evangelicals are perceived by the non-churched culture ’round about us. It is sobering to consider that on these grounds, Jesus himself would likely have been deeply alienated from the church as it generally expresses itself in the US, the UK, and Australia. This puts a new spin on that text “Behold, I stand at the door and knock.” Missional churches all around the world are now trying to find ways in which to embody the gospel in an incarnational way. Whether it be Third Place Communities in Tasmania, where the community commits to always gather in public social spaces and never in private sacred buildings, or the church of which Michael is part (marvelously named Small Boat, Big Sea) where people experience a culturally seamless expression of Jesus, or the Breakfast Club in Pomona where the experience of church is built around the natural conversation of a breakfast table. For us at least, it is in these struggling little communities that the hope of the gospel in the West resides. For in such ways the biblical prophecy of the Incarnation of God in Jesus will once again be true in our day, that people living in darkness might once again see a great light (Matt. 4:16). It is absolutely vital for the gospel to be incarnated into the thousands of subcultures that now exist in our complex, postmodern, tribalized, Western contexts. It is vital that these multiform people and subcultures encounter Jesus from within their own cultures and from within their own communities, for only there can they truly comprehend him. It is now critical for the sake of the gospel itself that these people experience salvation in a way that does not dislocate them from their organic groups but rather allows them to encounter Jesus in a way that is seamlessly connected with life as they have come to understand it through their own histories and experiences. But the greatest argument for the case of incarnational mission in the end is the undeniable fact that it was the missional mode in which God himself engaged the world; it should be no less ours! The Incarnational Approach 61 As we’ve already pointed out, the relationship between the traditional Christendom mode of church and the world around it can best be described as being fundamentally attractional. That is, the church expects people to be willing to come to some centrally located religious institution at the heart of the culture to hear, respond, and be nurtured in the gospel. The church bids people to come and hear the gospel within the holy confines of the church and its community. This seems so natural to us after seventeen centuries of Christendom, but at what price and to what avail have we allowed it to continue? If our actions imply that God is really only present in official church activities—worship, Bible studies, Christian youth meetings, ladies fellowships—then it follows that mission and evangelism simply involve inviting people to church-related meetings. In fact, this is one of the core assumptions that the attractional church is based upon—the assumption that God cannot really be accessed outside sanctioned church meetings or, at least, that these meetings are the best place for not-yet-Christians to learn about God. Evangelism therefore is primarily about mobilizing church members to attract unbelievers into church where they can experience God. Rather than being genuine “out-reach,” it e!ectively becomes something more like an “in-drag.” Sphere of Direct Influence Christendom & Church Growth Incarnational & Missional Mission mode & impulse is inward (attractional) Cells and evangelism exist to get people into church Christians cluster at center Appropriate for outreach to sphere of direct influence Mission mode & impulse is outward (sending) Cells and mission exist to create organic communities of faith in the context of mission Christians spread out in context Appropriate for all forms of mission Now, we are not suggesting that people can’t experience God in a church service. Of course they can, for in the preaching of God’s Word and the worship of God’s people his true voice can be heard. But if the church limits God’s agency in this world to particular times and places that the vast majority of not-yet-Christians have no access to, or no desire to attend, then the gospel is e!ectively hobbled. God becomes mute to the vast majority of people in the Western world, people who cannot interpret the church culture that has e!ectively imprisoned the good news within its cultural system. The only means to evangelize people becomes organizing little “patrols” to go into the world in order to rescue them and bring them back to the safety of “church.” Many westerners in our post-Christendom era report that they’ve tried church and found it wanting. If they don’t want to go back, what then? If they won’t come to us, we have to go to them. This approach, being incarnational, is the opposite of being attractional. It implies something of a Go-ToThem approach to mission and evangelism. Instead of asking non-Christians to Come-To-Us, to our services, our gatherings, and our programs on our terms, the incarnational church seeks to infiltrate society to represent Christ in the world. That is why we propose that a radical shift needs to take place in this time— a shift from the attractional mode to an incarnational one. This is no mean request, because the vast majority of churches in the West (95 percent?) operate in a nonincarnational mode of mission. An incarnational mode creates a church that is a dynamic set of relationships, friendships, and acquaintances. It enhances and “flavors” the host community’s living social fabric rather than disaffirming it. It thus creates a medium of living relationships through which the gospel can travel. It emphasizes the importance of a group of Christians infiltrating a community, like salt and light, to make those creative connections with people where God-talk and shared experience allow for real cross-cultural Christian mission to take place. The missional-incarnational church starts with the basic theological understandings: God constantly comes to those who are the most unlikely. For example, the Hebrews were the world’s outcasts. God chose them. The Old Testament story of Ruth is profoundly missional. It is part of the continuing story of God’s future plans emerging through the strangest and most unlikely people and places. In that story God revealed that his future for Israel was to be fulfilled in and through a Gentile (Ruth). If we are to take incarnational mission seriously, then we must see that God’s future—his new creation—is not just among “his people” (churchgoing Christians) but it is among the “ordinary” people—the lost, strugglers, and listless ones of our world. Going to Ignored People Some time ago I (Michael) was watching my daughter play soccer in a local park. Next to the field was an asphalted area where a group of model-car enthusiasts had set up a track and were using remote controls to race their cars The Incarnational Approach 63 against one another’s. The constant buzz of the miniature motors caught our attention and we wandered over to watch what they were doing. We soon realized we had encountered a lost suburban tribe. Everyone looked the same. They all wore tight black jeans and checkered flannel shirts. They wore baseball caps with car manufacturers’ logos on them. They had parked their cars—virtually all drove pickups—beside the track, and their wives or girlfriends sat in one of the truck beds talking and laughing loudly. It was a tribe in every sense of the word—dress code, language, culture, and customs. We learned that once a month on a Sunday morning they met to race each other, to discuss the latest designs in model cars, and to drink and laugh and build community. If the nearby church decided that this suburban tribe needed to hear about the saving work of Christ, how would they reach them? The attractional church would hold special services for model-car racers. It would design an excellent flyer explaining that Jesus loves model-car enthusiasts, and they would place one under the windshield wipers of each pickup. It would try to find a recently converted model-car enthusiast and have him share his testimony one Sunday morning. The attractional church would seek to do anything it could to draw the car racing fraternity into its church building. This might even work if you’re dealing with a localized community with some geographic proximity to the church building. But a car club community usually draws people from a very large geographic area. The model-car club is probably a citywide community, and its members probably drive great distances to come to its monthly meetings. They are not drawn together by some geographic proximity, but by a commonly held interest. And to complicate matters further, they meet on Sunday mornings! The attractional church is stuck! Even though it has a close-knit community of people (likely non-churchgoers) right outside its door, it has no mechanism for sharing Christ with them. Since they (the car club members) are not likely to turn up at the church service one Sunday (doesn’t the attractional church love stories of people miraculously turning up at the church service searching for meaning and purpose!), the only way to share Christ’s love with them must be to go to them. It would be a decidedly incarnational choice if a few members of a local church, so moved by compassion for the car enthusiasts right across the road, chose to buy a model car and join the club! This would be the kind of thinking and acting we’re talking about. If the spirit of our missionary God were to sweep through such a church, we don’t doubt that the church itself might buy a few model cars and commission some of its members to miss the morning service so they can fully enter into the community of the car club. By racing cars and repairing cars, they could earn the right of relationship to share their thoughts on life and their love for Jesus. This is the incarnational church in action. If a few car racers came into relationship with Christ, they should not be encouraged to leave the club and join the church. Rather, a home church could be established, and the brand-new Christian car enthusiasts could worship God in the context of their tribal identity. The Missional Church Is Incarnational The missional-incarnational church adopts a stance totally di!erent from the attractional one. Rather than investing time in the creation and development of sacred religious spaces for people to meet God, this mode recognizes that church is a much more organic, dynamic, and non-institutionalized set of relationships than the old Christendom mode allows for. If the attractional mode sees the world as divided into two zones, the “in” and the “out,” the incarnational model sees it more as a web, a series of intersecting lines symbolizing the networks of relationships, friendships, and acquaintances of which church members are a part. It was Jesus who, in calling the first members of his faith community, the disciples, invited them to become fishers of people (Mark 1:16–18). By calling fishermen and inviting them to fish for humans, he used language that made sense to his hearers. But he did more than that. He used an image or a metaphor that conveyed a great deal more than some simple idea that he was concerned with “catching” people. He made reference to an activity that fishermen engaged in regularly, and by doing so created a sense of the missional community that was to come. When we refer to fishing in our Western context, we think about a single person with a single rod and a single hook on the end of a single line. The fisherman is attempting to catch one fish with each cast of the line. It is a one-on-one engagement, and good fishermen know how to read the weather, the tides, the presence of weed, and the use of lures to catch that one fish. So when we read about Jesus inviting the first disciples (and by inference us) to fish for people, we might assume it’s a similar one-on-one a!air. We have thought of evangelism like this in recent years. We have been sent out to fish for someone we can bring into our church. Getting someone to attend a service with us or come to an evangelistic breakfast or youth rally has formed the foundation of much Western evangelism. But unfortunately, a good many people in the West believe they have tried church and were left unsatisfied or they aren’t interested at all in church attendance. But if we think about fishing during Jesus’ time, it wasn’t done with rods and reels. It wasn’t one-on-one. Jesus’ disciples would have thought of fishing The Incarnational Approach 65 with a net. They would have cast their nets out into the water, and dredged or dragged the sea as they hauled the net back onto the boat. Whatever happened to be swimming in the way of the net as it was lugged back on board would have been caught. The key to successful fishing wasn’t in the technical details of tides and weather patterns, but in the strength of the nets. For this
