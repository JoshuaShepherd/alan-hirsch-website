---# The Shape of the Missional Church

> “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you. Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.”   
> — *Luke 10:5–7*

## Jesus’ Church-Planting Strategy: The Person of Peace

In his commissioning address, Jesus instructs his followers to seek out a “person of peace” in every community. This approach was central to his church-planting strategy. Rather than advocating a blanket, door-to-door style of evangelism, Jesus encouraged his disciples to focus their attention on relationships established with these key individuals and their households.

Missiologists like Charles Brock and George Patterson argue that identifying and investing in a “person of peace” is critical to a healthy church-starting process. Despite this, few churches begin in this way. Many contemporary churches devote substantial resources to mass advertising—print, electronic, and direct mail—hoping to attract as many people as possible to church meetings. At first glance, concentrating ministry efforts within the household of a person of peace may seem less effective. However, in the long-term, churches that emerge from the households of local, indigenous leaders are richer and more resilient.

For example, Paul followed this model in Corinth, centering his ministry on the home of Priscilla and Aquila, local tentmakers (Acts 18:1–4). People of peace are those who are spiritually receptive, of good reputation, and influential in their communities. When they become believers, they confidently share their faith within their networks, often initiating new home-based churches.

Missional thinkers suggest church planters should seriously consider the pivotal role of persons of peace instead of pursuing a ‘shotgun’ approach. This approach is radically different from traditional church programs, which frequently “extract” new believers from their social settings, disconnecting them from their existing friendships. By contrast, the person-of-peace, incarnational model keeps new believers embedded in their networks, enabling them—with training, nurture, and support—to lead friends to Christ and establish churches within their communities. Such a model is inherently more reproducible, sustainable, and contextually authentic.

## Multiplication, Not Addition

The incarnational approach to church emphasizes multiplication over mere addition. The assumption that “bigger is better” is a modernist notion. In today's splintered and tribalized Western societies, we contend that smaller, more culturally vibrant communities prove more effective than large, program-centric organizations, which often necessitate more control and less freedom.

The missional-incarnational church seeks to reproduce itself through multiplication, not by filling pews. While this might have worked in the monochrome culture of postwar suburban America, the Western world has since fractured into myriad subcultures—even in the suburbs—making the one-size-fits-all model increasingly obsolete.

As society diversifies into subcultures, churches, like missionaries, must adapt by understanding and participating in the rhythms of each specific “tribe.” Smaller, targeted, incarnational communities are sometimes criticized for lacking evangelistic fervor. However, advocates maintain that multiplying incarnational congregations, rather than simply swelling church attendance, is the more biblical and effective paradigm.

### Jonathan Campbell’s Baton Church Model

Jonathan Campbell, using the metaphor of a baton, argues that the gospel and church life should be mobile, transferable, and contextual:

> “God’s strategy for building his kingdom is through the growing and multiplication of missionary communities. Although the context and methods will change, the mission of the church is timeless. The church is to share the good news of Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit among all social groupings and gather those who respond into disciple-making communities. New churches flow naturally from disciple-making in the community context.”

**The Cycle of Multiplicative Church Growth:**
1. An existing church commissions a church-planting team.
2. The team evangelizes strategic people (persons of peace).
3. With new disciples, the team plants an indigenous church.
4. The indigenous church commissions a new church-planting team.
5. The cycle repeats.

The church is thus seen as part of an ongoing organic process rather than a static institution. Buildings or institutional permanence are less important; the goal is to reproduce and multiply, not merely to sustain oneself. This requires a paradigm shift—from institution to movement—and a renewed focus on cultivating visionary, biblical, and imaginative leadership, selected on a clear commitment to stated philosophy and vision.

## Leadership: Beyond the Pastoral Hierarchy

> We cannot find the term “senior pastor” in the New Testament, but we can find Paul’s desire for the church to be led by all five leadership giftings, acting in concert for a balanced biblical equipping of the saints.

The New Testament presents a model of fivefold leadership: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers (Eph. 4:11–13). Instead of a hierarchical, pastor-centric leadership structure, the missional-incarnational church seeks an egalitarian, cooperative leadership community.

The overemphasis on pastors and teachers historically has quenched the missionary heart of apostles and prophets. “Good teaching” alone cannot equip the church to serve its community fully. Rather, robust leadership should function as “a community within a community,” reflecting the priesthood of all believers—a radical New Testament concept that dissolves the distinction between clergy and laity, between the sacred and the secular.

A new congregation should establish this leadership matrix from inception, ensuring all five functions are equally balanced and complementary.

## The Problem of Buildings

Many churches are preoccupied with obtaining and maintaining buildings, which can shape their priorities and theology in unintended ways.

> “Any church that cannot get by without buildings, finances, and paid experts is not fully being church.”  
> —Andrew Jones

In much of the globally growing church—in Asia, Africa, and Latin America—believers meet in homes, under trees, by rivers, in cafés, and other “third places.” By contrast, many Western churches are hindered by their dependence on buildings, leading to what has been called an “edifice complex.”

### Building-Centric Problems Identified by Howard Snyder:
Church buildings often reflect:
- Immobility
- Inflexibility
- Lack of fellowship
- Pride
- Class divisions

> “The gospel says ‘Go,’ but our church buildings say, ‘Stay.’ The gospel says, ‘Seek the lost,’ but our churches say, ‘Let the lost seek the church.’”

A building-centered model often mandates organizational priorities around mortgage payments and programmatic schedules, reinforcing the attractional paradigm.

### Old Temple Thinking

Rob Warner in *21st Century Church* describes “old temple thinking”—the set of assumptions that:
- Sacred buildings are necessary for “true” worship
- Church building is the only venue to meet or hear from God
- Buildings symbolize God’s permanence in the community
- Churches must rival other religions in architectural grandeur

Jacques Ellul reminds us that Christianity is not a new religion but “antireligion.” Christ is the cornerstone; in him, believers themselves are the spiritual temple.

Early Christians met in homes, later modeling dedicated buildings on Roman and Greek household lounges, not grand temples. The medium is the message: a lounge room signals friendship, hospitality, safety, participation, and mutuality. Churches may meet anywhere, but all should carefully consider the messages conveyed by their meeting places and rituals.

## Extractional vs. Incarnational/ Reproduction Models

Carol Davis provides a helpful comparison (adapted below):

| Extractional/Single Convert/“Growth” Model | Incarnational/Reproduction Model     |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Focuses on church culture                  | Focuses on mission culture          |
| Takes place on believers’ turf, e.g. services| Begins on unbelievers’ turf         |
| Draws people into church                   | Finds persons of peace              |
| Starts in church buildings                 | Starts in homes/third places        |
| Large group celebrations                   | Small group/house fellowships       |
| Academic teaching of Scripture             | Practical application of Scripture  |
| Builds programs and buildings              | Builds leaders                      |
| Imported professional clergy               | Indigenous disciples as leaders     |
| Heavy financial investment                 | Minimal, often bi-vocational        |
| Imported resources                         | Local resources                     |
| Clergy-centered structure                  | Lay/leader-centered structure       |
| Slow growth, can stagnate                  | Encourages rapid reproduction       |
| Objective: church needs                    | Objective: community needs          |

While sacred spaces can be personally significant, we caution against implying that God resides only in church buildings. God’s presence is not confined; Christian spirituality affirms God is present in all places at all times.

## The Four Objectives of Incarnational Mission

1. **Real Connection**:  
   For non-Christians to see that Jesus is “for” the host community—having its best interests at heart.  
   **Practical strategies:**  
   - **Presence:** Active involvement of missionaries.
   - **Partnerships:** Working with local groups to address community needs.
   - **Inquiry Groups:** Safe spaces for spiritual exploration.

2. **Real Demonstration**:  
   To demonstrate that Jesus is “with” the host community through gracious, humble, and merciful engagement.

3. **Real Access**:  
   To show that Jesus is “in” the host community by prioritizing indigenous leadership and allowing for self-theologizing expressions of faith.

4. **Real Encounter**:  
   When two generations of local leaders, independent of the initiating missionaries, have emerged, Jesus is fully “of” the community.

### Example: Third Place Communities (TPC), Hobart, Australia

TPC members live near a local pub, frequently gathering there to foster “third places”—shared, neutral spaces—where Christians and non-Christians can engage authentically. Their contextual approach includes relevant business and cultural projects, establishing real connection and demonstration in their host community.

## Defining "Church" Biblically

> “The church is described as belonging not to the people by whom it is constituted ... nor to the district to which they belong ... but rather to the one who has brought it into existence (that is, God) or the one through whom this has taken place (that is, Christ).”
> —Robert Banks, *Paul’s Idea of Community*

A “church” is not merely any gathering of Christians. Key elements include:
- **Mutual commitment**
- **Shared long-term calling**
- **Accountability**
- **Regular rhythm of worship, learning, and mission**

Acts 2:42–47 offers this snapshot, showing three broad, interconnected relationships, like sides of an equilateral triangle:

1. **Communion** (with Christ)
   - Encountering God’s Word
   - Worship in various settings

2. **Community** (with one another)
   - Learning and formation
   - Genuine fellowship/friendship

3. **Commission** (with the world)
   - Radical generosity and hospitality
   - Gospel sharing integrated with life

Emphasis on all three is essential; over-specialization leads to imbalance. Churches are defined by these commitments, not by buildings, frequency of meetings, or the presence of ordained ministers.

**Jonathan Campbell’s Baton churches** provide a helpful guide in distinguishing between:

| Sphere of Authority    | Degree of Flexibility                                                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Christ’s Commands     | Core; nonnegotiable and unchanging                                                 |
| Apostolic Teaching    | Substantive; adapt only to maintain dynamic equivalency                            |
| Early Church Behavior | Applications; interpret and contextualize to culture                               |
| Established Traditions| Expressions; fully adaptable for the culture                                       |

Hold fast to the core—experiment boldly with the expression.

## Contextualization: The Key to Missional Effectiveness

### Knocking on the Wrong Doors

Cross-cultural missteps, like British missionaries using Revelation 3:20 ("I stand at the door and knock") in African contexts where doors are absent, illustrate the urgent need for contextualization. In those contexts, only thieves would knock, making the metaphor counterproductive.

### A Working Definition

**Contextualization** is the dynamic process whereby the unchanging gospel interacts with specific human situations and worldviews, adapting its presentation for meaningful engagement. It is about presenting Christianity so that it meets people’s deepest needs and makes sense within their culture, enabling them to follow Christ without abandoning their identity.

As René Padilla observes:

> “To contextualize the gospel is to translate it so the Lordship of Jesus Christ is not an abstract principle or doctrine, but the determining factor of life in all its dimensions, and the basic criterion by which all cultural values are evaluated.”

### Why Contextualize?

- **Because Christ did it:** Jesus entered human culture, engaging ordinary people.
- **Because the first Christians practiced it:** Paul adapted his message to his audience (compare Acts 13 and Acts 17).
- **Because it works:** Contextualization honors God and makes the gospel more effective.
- **Because the gospel and context are inseparable:** As Charles Kraft notes, we are immersed in culture; it is the medium through which we encounter everything.

The church must continually engage in contextualization to remain vibrant—a tidal pool refreshed by mission and new believers, not a stagnant billabong.

## Moving Forward: Contextualization as Missional Imperative

- **Experiment with forms and structures:** Hold fast to the core truths of Christ, but contextualize expression without fear.
- **Embody innovation and cultural engagement:** The incarnational church is not a franchise but a dynamic, locally flavored, and culturally sensitive movement.
- **Prioritize gospel clarity in context:** Avoid importing practices, symbols, or language that alienates those outside the church’s subculture.
- **Think mission, not church:** Reimagine the church as a missionary movement within the Western context.

The refusal to contextualize the gospel is among the church’s gravest errors and will only hasten its decline in relevance. As David Bosch writes, “The missionary nature of the Church does not just depend on the situation in which it finds itself at a given moment, but is grounded in the Gospel itself.”
