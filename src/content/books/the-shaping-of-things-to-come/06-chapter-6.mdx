---# Recovering a Messianic Spirituality of Engagement

> “Christianity is not a doctrine but a person to whom I entrust myself without reserve. If Christianity were merely a doctrine, its leader would be just as superfluous as the teachers of any other sort of religious or philosophical system. The focus would be on truth claims, which are learned and then appropriated independently of the instructor. Since, however, Christianity is not simply a set of beliefs but is inseparably connected to the person of the Messiah, it stands or falls with him.”  
> — Dietrich Bonhoeffer

## Asceticism and the Loss of Life-Affirmation

Throughout church history, otherworldliness and extreme asceticism have, at their worst, drawn believers away from engaging the world missionally. Figures often hailed as saints within the church—such as Patrick, Aiden, Cuthbert, and even Francis of Assisi—adopted practices of severe bodily discipline. Francis, for example, denied himself basic comforts, such as shoes and bathing, and exposed himself to the elements to battle temptation, refusing to own any possession.

While such devotion is notable, it contrasts sharply with the life-affirming spirituality embodied by Jesus. For the church to rediscover a missional and messianic spirituality, we must return directly to Jesus as our model. Only then can we explore how our actions logically extend from his mission and participate redemptively in the world.

## Defining Messianic Spirituality

We deliberately use the term “messianic” to emphasize that Christology must inform missiology. The actions and mission of God’s people should be shaped by the person and work of Jesus as witnessed in the Gospels. We propose a reorientation that reads all Scripture—Paul included—through the lens of the Gospels, not the other way around.

### Christological Distortions

Historically, the church, especially in the era of Christendom, has focused on dogmatic and ontological debates about Christ’s nature, often at the expense of the historical and practical realities of Jesus as model for mission and discipleship. This has led to what some call “Pauline” Christianity, overshadowing the actual teachings and mission of Jesus himself. Paul, however, always directed attention to Jesus (see 1 Corinthians 1:11–17; 11:1). 

### Rediscovering Jesus the Messiah

Widespread surveys show Jesus remains compelling and accessible—even to those outside the church. This “missional currency” is not merely a pragmatic asset; rather, it reflects the truth that Christ defines Christianity. To move the church into a genuinely missional-messianic mode, the centrality of Jesus must be recovered in every aspect of faith and practice.

Our primary relationship with God is mediated through Jesus the Messiah. Our connection to the Trinity is rooted in his person. As disciples, we are called to embody messianic purposes in the world, never relegating Jesus to a secondary place.

> “Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Christianity without discipleship, and Christianity without discipleship is always Christianity without Christ.”  
> — Dietrich Bonhoeffer

The centrality of Jesus places us inextricably within the messianic story and task. Our mission and identity are bound to him (see John 14:6; John 6:68). In a global culture increasingly hostile to the exclusivity of Christ, these claims become more crucial than ever.

## The Nature of Jesus: Holiness and Engagement

Modern portrayals risk painting Jesus as overly serious, somber, and excessively focused on suffering. While aspects of his mission were challenging and sorrowful, the dominant scriptural witness also reveals Jesus’ holiness as profoundly attractive—even to “sinners.” Unlike much contemporary Christianity that values being with the “right people in the right places,” Jesus was frequently found in the “wrong” company.

We must reclaim Jesus’ model of holy joy, infectious holiness, and a faith rooted among ordinary people. Christlikeness involves not only hard work but also the joy and vitality of sharing life and mission with Jesus—including being with the interesting and marginalized. Our eternal destiny is to be conformed to his image (Romans 8:29); this must shape our missional engagement today.

## The Redemptive Value of Our Actions

We are called to do more than merely imitate Jesus’ actions; mysteriously, our deeds participate in God’s purposes through Christ. Without collapsing into debates of salvation by works versus grace (which will be explored further elsewhere), it is sufficient here to state that our actions have intrinsic, though not salvific, value and participate redemptively in God’s work.

Traditionally, Protestant fear of “works righteousness” has led to underestimating humanity’s role in God’s redemptive plan. Such dualistic thinking, stressing “all of God” and “we are nothing,” may diminish the divine value invested in human freedom and image. A renewed messianic perspective affirms humanity’s central role in the drama of redemption.

> “World history is not God’s autobiography alone; it is God’s biography, written by God and people. God supplies the letters, and people write the sentence.”

This partnership with God in daily affairs shifts our missional focus—our actions carry eternal significance and extend God’s kingdom in the world.

## Returning to the Roots: The Significance of a Hebraic Worldview

A revolutionary approach to church requires recovering the missional genius of the early church, modeled on Jesus. This necessitates a fresh encounter with the central figure of the faith, which in turn prompts a return to the Hebrew spiritual tradition.

### Christendom’s Inoculation and Its Aftermath

The project of Christendom—seventeen centuries of Christianity in the West—has, in many ways, inoculated cultures against the raw gospel, producing spiritual bankruptcy and often failing in the grand mission of God. The Western church’s complicity in historical injustices (e.g., in South Africa, the American South, Europe, and Latin America) illustrates the depth of the problem.

This “inoculation” is akin to how a vaccine works: a weakened version prevents deeper engagement with the real thing. In similar fashion, much traditional spirituality has been more concerned with retreat and reflection than with engaged action in the world.

### Personal Journeys to Hebraic Spirituality

For some, such as Alan (a Jew who found redemption in Jesus), the turn toward Hebraic spirituality was natural—a return that brought profound enrichment and renewed focus on Jesus. For others, such as Michael (a Catholic influenced by Benedictine spirituality), the journey led through thinkers such as Martin Buber and Abraham Heschel, returning to a more authentic, rooted worldview.

Judaism, especially as articulated by Buber, Heschel, Elie Wiesel, and early Hasidic rabbis, resonates deeply with the Scriptures (including the New Testament) and provides fertile ground for a missional spirituality.

## Recovering a Messianic Spirituality

Christianity is organically birthed from the Jewish heritage; its “genetic code” is Hebraic. Christianity indeed redefined Judaism through the emergence of the Messiah but did so by engaging basic Hebraic structures and worldviews. As Christianity spread into the Hellenistic-Roman world, many benefits accrued, but one loss was the drift from a Hebraic worldview to a more speculative, dualistic, and sometimes anti-Semitic framework.

### The Hellenistic-Hebraic Contrast

#### 1. Concrete/Historical vs. Speculative/Theoretical

- **Hellenistic thinking** emphasizes speculation: discussions about the nature of being, metaphysics, and ontology dominate its approach.
- **Hebraic thinking** is concrete and historical, rooted not in abstract notions but in lived experience and history as the vehicle for revelation.
- The early Christian creeds reflect a speculative focus, addressing divine ontology without reference to mission, ethics, or discipleship. This shift prioritized right thinking (orthodoxy) over right living (orthopraxy), contrary to much of Scripture’s emphasis.

#### 2. History as the Vehicle of Revelation

In Hebraic faith, history is the primary means of divine revelation. The saints of Scripture are real people—flawed, messy, yet used by God as vehicles for his purposes. The incarnation dignifies human life and experience, rooting redemption in the particularities of dusty Judea. This has significant implications for mission: just as God entered the mess of history, so too must the church.

#### 3. The Redemption of Everyday Life

Jewish tradition’s sheer love of life—expressed in `l’chaim` (“to life!”)—sustains cultural and spiritual vigor even amid suffering. The Hebraic worldview affirmatively embraces pleasure and the goodness of creation, seeing all of life as sacred when connected to God.

### Seven Salient Features of a Hebraic Missional Spirituality

1. **Redemption of Pleasure**: Dualistic religion often suppresses the body and pleasure, but the Hebraic tradition affirms both within the framework of God’s moral will.  
    > "One day we will all stand before God, and He will judge us for all the possible pleasures He gave us to enjoy, but which we failed to enjoy."  
    — Rabbinic Saying

2. **Integration of Sacred and Secular**: In Hebraic thought, there is no division between secular and sacred. All aspects of life are brought into relationship with God.

3. **Daily Connections**: The logic of Torah demonstrates that every dimension of existence—work, domestic life, health, worship—matters to God.

4. **Monotheistic Unity**: The Shema (“Hear, O Israel…”) is not just a metaphysical statement but a practical claim calling for undivided loyalty and the unification of all aspects of life under one God.

5. **Releasing the Glory of God**: Jewish mysticism teaches that holy actions release “sparks” of God’s glory (Shekinah) scattered throughout creation. While not to be taken literally, this metaphor encourages seeing all of life as participating in God’s redemptive work.

6. **Hallowing the Everyday (Kavanah)**: Kavanah is the practice of directing the whole person—mind, heart, will—toward God in every action. Holiness is not found merely in ritual but in the attentive, sacred intention behind every deed.

    > "Man exerts influence on the eternal, and this is not done by any special works, but by the intention with which he does all his works. This is the teaching of the hallowing of the everyday."  
    — Martin Buber

7. **Engaged Mission**: A truly missional, incarnational church must recover a sense of the ultimate meaning of our actions; history is the ground where God is at work, and the place where his people must engage.

## Moving Forward: Implications and Applications

A return to the Hebraic matrix of Christian faith challenges the Western church to:

- Re-center Jesus as both Lord and model for life and mission.
- Integrate all aspects of life under God’s rule, dissolving unbiblical barriers between sacred and secular.
- Celebrate the goodness of creation, including embodied pleasure, as part of redemptive mission.
- Embrace practical engagement—working with God in the “mess” of history.
- Practice intentional holiness (kavanah), finding God in the concrete details of ordinary life.

By embracing a messianic spirituality of engagement, rooted in the life and teachings of Jesus and informed by the richness of its Hebraic heritage, the church can recover its genuine missional genius for our time.
