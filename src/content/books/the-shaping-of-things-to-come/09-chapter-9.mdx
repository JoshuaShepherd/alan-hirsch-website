---# The Genius of APEST: Fivefold Ministry and the Missional Church

## The Fivefold Ministry and the Whole Church

The fivefold ministry belongs to, and describes in some way, the whole church. If we understand the phrase “to each one of us,” along with the repeated distribution formula “he ... gave some to be,” it naturally implies that all Christians are included in some part of the APEST (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) structure.

Paul’s primary concern in Ephesians 4 was not, as is often assumed, to outline official church leadership. Rather, he was describing the church as a whole. We are grateful to the leadership team of St. John’s Church in Sheffield, England, for introducing us to this two-dimensional reading of the text. They hosted a group of Australian leaders, seeking manifestations of the missional church across the UK.

Paul did not operate under the misconceptions of ordained ministry that are so entrenched in Christendom. The New Testament makes no distinction between clergy and laity—all are ministers. This truth must be continually reinforced, especially in light of 1,700 years of Christendom. Paul described everyone in the church as fitting somewhere within the APEST model. If we could analyze the gift-typing of the entire church, all would be represented within this fivefold nature of ministry.

### Implications of the APEST Structure

This fresh perspective on the church’s gifting structure, if accepted and practiced, could unleash significant renewal as people connect with their primary callings. While this may seem like a new reading, it is evident in local churches—one only has to look.

Try applying the APEST lens to those in your community:
- Many are classic pioneering types (clearly apostolic) even if they're not "in the ministry."
- Others are gifted teachers, with an innate grasp and ability to communicate biblical truths without formal training.
- Some have multiple primary APEST gifts but may not hold leadership positions.

We do not disregard Paul’s instructions for church elders (leaders). Rather, we see the leadership matrix as a "community within the community," comprised of those who exemplify and embody these ministries—APEST leaders serving the APEST body. Thus, leaders may be classic pastors, prophets, or apostles, called to lead in the mode they are already gifted in—this is a "calling within the calling."

As we have said, all Christians are ministers, but significant mission and ministry will not occur until we take this seriously. As Mike Breen of St. John’s Sheffield phrases it, we must acknowledge the brute fact that not all ordained ministers are necessarily leaders. Leadership is distinct from gifting and ministry; one can be a good minister and a terrible leader. Being prophetic, for example, does not guarantee organizational effectiveness. Leadership is the capacity to influence and mobilize others. Sometimes, gifting and leadership overlap, but not always.

The APEST matrix does not function in isolation. Each role gains its legitimacy from the total system. Unfortunately, many churches prefer pastors (shepherds) and teachers, to the exclusion of apostles, prophets, and evangelists—a perversion of Paul’s model. This commits the missional-apostolic church to a communal understanding of ministry and leadership, operating as a body at all levels—especially leadership, since leaders model ministry.

There is no place for hierarchical, “senior pastor at the top” structures. Biblically, leadership must be APEST. For example, at South Melbourne Restoration Community, a developing APEST leadership team, under Debra Hirsch, helps all ministers (everyone) find and pursue their parts. St. John’s in Sheffield, led by Mike Breen and Paddy Mallon, has pioneered pathways for members to discover their APEST gifting and developed discipleship and leadership training around each one. The result: explosive mission and ministry.

## Sociological Dimensions: The Sociology of APEST

If we view the church as any human organization and examine the impact of different leadership styles, we find Paul’s radical plan affirmed by current best practices in leadership and management theory.

### Five Leadership Styles in Secular Terms

Most leadership systems acknowledge the following types:
- **Entrepreneur:** The groundbreaker and strategist who initiates mission.
- **Questioner:** The one who disturbs the status quo and challenges direction.
- **Communicator/Recruiter:** The one who spreads the organization's message outside.
- **Humanizer:** The caring “glue,” supporting individuals.
- **Systematizer:** The organizer who articulates and structures the whole.

In most theories, these agendas conflict. But imagine a system where each type engages dynamically with the others—a significant synergy results. Paul’s model in Ephesians proposes such an interactive, harmonious structure:

| Sociological Role    | Pauline Role  |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Entrepreneur         | Apostle       |
| Questioner           | Prophet       |
| Recruiter            | Evangelist    |
| Humanizer            | Shepherd      |
| Systematizer         | Teacher       |

The effective combination of these styles creates more than the sum of its parts. Organizations (including churches) that focus on one or two styles are poorer for it.

#### Exercise
Remove one leadership mode from the equation (e.g., the entrepreneur) and assess what is lost. Repeat for each type, and reflect on missing or additional factors needed.

## The Ecology of Missional Growth

Three primary principles for organic organizational development:
1. **Organic**: Systems must be natural and life-giving.
2. **Reproducible**: Structures should be easily replicated.
3. **Self-sustaining**: The system should maintain and regenerate itself.

### The APEST System Is:
- **Organic**: Ephesians uses body, ligament, and unity-diversity imagery. APEST is part of the church’s “DNA”—not to be tampered with.
- **Reproducible**: The APEST matrix is inherent to church nature—every healthy community finds these gifts among its members.
- **Self-sustaining**: A church operating in APEST mode grows and matures itself (Eph 4:14–16).

The deep, theological unity “in Christ” allows for wide diversity in personality, spirituality, style, and gifting. This reflects the organizational principle of “fit and split,” “contend and transcend”:
- **Fit**: What binds the community together (unity, shared ethos).
- **Split**: Intentional diversity and plurality.
- **Contend**: Open permission to debate and dialogue (duality).
- **Transcend**: Corporate commitment to overcome disagreements and find new answers (vitality).

Teaching and shepherding alone cannot sustain mission—dynamic interaction among all five gifts is required for renewal.

## APEST and Organizational Life Cycles

All organizations experience life cycles, from **Dream** to **Closure**:
- **Inception**: Requires apostolic (entrepreneurial) leadership.
- **Growth**: Shaped by apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic leaders.
- **Maintenance**: Shepherds and teachers become predominant.
- **Decline**: Often marked by nostalgia and loss of original vision.

A truly healthy system has all five gifts active continually. However, churches often lose apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic leaders (who find space only in parachurch, business, or government), leading to decline.

#### The Pioneer-Settler Analogy
- Pioneers (APEs) break new ground.
- Settlers (STs) build and sustain.
- Both are necessary; leadership requires "accelerator" and "brake" types.

## Kierkegaard’s Parable of the Geese

> Imagine if geese held worship, heard sermons about their destiny to fly, listened reverently, but then waddled home and never actually flew. Some geese who tried to fly suffered, looked different, and were avoided. Meanwhile, the rest grew plump and believed their comfort was a sign of grace.
>
> — Paraphrased from Søren Kierkegaard, “The Tame Geese: A Revivalistic Meditation”

Like the geese, church communities may listen to lofty visions but rarely act, settling for comfort rather than pursuing their high calling.

## Imagination and the Leadership Task

### The Death of the Art of Ministry

Despite global diversity, most churches are strikingly similar—predictable, templated, lacking creativity. This is due primarily to standardized pastoral leadership and ministry training, both of which stifle innovation by failing to value imagination.

Evangelical culture, not just theology, tends to be middle-class and resistant to marginal or atypical expression, which limits genuine freedom. Art is the struggle between form and substance—so it should be with ministry and worship. Creative expression is vital.

### Imagination and the New Millennial Culture

Winston Churchill noted, *“The empires of the future will be the empires of the imagination.”* For the church, imagination enables:
- **Visualization**: Imagining what does not yet exist.
- **Resourcefulness**: Forming creative solutions to problems.
- **Innovation**: Bringing new ideas into reality and value.

Churches must embrace right-brain (creative, experiential) approaches to connect in contemporary "designer" culture.

#### Three Principles from Einstein

1. **Imagination Is More Important Than Knowledge**

   > "Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."  
   > —Albert Einstein

   Progress requires creative vision, not mere information. The church must be intentional about design and meaning—actively shaping its presentation to communicate with a sophisticated, visually oriented audience.

2. **If You Can’t Imagine It, You Can’t Do It**

   Stephen Covey calls this "first and second creations": one must envision before actualizing. Poverty is not just lack of resources, but absence of dream or vision. The leader's core task is to awaken purpose, hope, and mission within the community—not merely impose a vision, but draw out and unite the little visions within a grander one.

3. **Solving Problems Requires a Different Order of Thinking**

   > "The kind of thinking that will solve the world’s problems will be of a different order to the kind of thinking that created them in the first place."  
   > —Albert Einstein

   Square thinking creates square problems; only by shifting paradigms can we address them. *Thomas Kuhn’s “Structure of Scientific Revolutions”* outlines paradigm shifts: established models give way when anomalies arise, most notably led by insiders who understand the paradigm best.

   Established institutions often resist innovation because legitimacy and identity are invested in current models—a dynamic also present in denominational and academic resistance to new forms of ministry.

### Paradigm Shifts and the Missional Church

A paradigm shift typically unfolds as follows:
1. A well-established paradigm dominates.
2. Anomalies and dissatisfaction arise among those most expert in the paradigm.
3. Recognition of the problem grows, dissenters emerge, and new theories are explored.
4. A new paradigm gains traction, often amid resistance from defenders of the old.

Innovation is often persecuted precisely because of its challenge to established legitimacy. True progress requires the courage to question sacred cows and create space for paradigm shifts.

## Some Keys to Paradigm Shifting

One crucial lesson: **People must believe there is a problem before they are open to a solution.** Leaders cannot impose change unless there is a recognized need. Engaging honestly with the status quo—and inviting the whole community into the dreaming, imagining, and acting on a shared vision—is essential.
