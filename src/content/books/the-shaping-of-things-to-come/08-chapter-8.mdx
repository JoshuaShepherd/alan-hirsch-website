---# From Bureaucrats to Missionaries: Redefining Ministry and the Medium of the Church

> “The church exists by mission as fire exists by burning.”  
> —Emil Brunner

## In Two Places at Once: The Practitioner-Scholar Model

Alan’s transition came when he accepted a denominational role overseeing mission and revitalization in one of Australia’s southern states, while continuing to lead a local church. This dual commitment ensured he remained a practitioner, not just a bureaucratic figure. Both of us felt the imperative to be “in two places at once”—to emplace ourselves both as practitioners and as theoreticians. As a result, we were integral to the inception of Forge—a missional training network in Australia, the US, and Canada.

This **ambidextrous approach** gave us unique strategic insight into both the church and Christianity in our context, highlighting the urgent dilemma—namely, that the church in the West must adopt a missionary stance toward its culture or risk extinction. Thus, God birthed the missionary within us. This was not a secondary shift in identity, but a primal, entirely reorienting one. It transformed everything: how we perceived the church, how we approached ministry, and even our connection to God. We learned to find God in unexpected places—places where traditional ministers might never venture.

Being missionaries to Australia fundamentally changed our perspective on ministry. We no longer call ourselves ministers; for us, the term “missionary” is more accurately descriptive. In fact, we believe that all ministry must be redefined missionally—ministry serves as a means to mission.

We share this personal “conversion” because we are convinced that it is necessary for all who wish to become truly missional-apostolic. Embracing this shift makes one, fundamentally, a revolutionary—it reveals that “things are not what they seem” in the average Christendom church.

> It’s time to fly the coop... literally!

## Freedom Always: Rethinking the Focus of Ministry

We both believe: **If we aim only at ministry, we seldom engage in real mission. But if we aim at mission, we must necessarily involve ourselves in ministry, because ministry is the vehicle by which mission is achieved.** The established church often gets this wrong; many never meaningfully engage with outsiders because their focus is primarily on the “saved,” a distortion of authentic New Testament faith and praxis.

## The Medium Really Is the Message

> “The medium is the message.”
> —Marshall McLuhan

This idea contains inherent danger because, in every important choice, one’s whole personality is at stake. It also requires a willingness to see God differently and to step outside previously restrictive paradigms.

Contemporary films like _The Matrix_ resonate with many Christians because they hint at the dormant but dangerous call to revolutionary discipleship—one synonymous with making history, not just preserving it.

### Understanding McLuhan

Marshall McLuhan proposed that all technologies and techniques (or “media”) are, in fact, extensions of ourselves. For example:

- **Wheel:** Extension of the foot
- **Weapon:** Extension of hand, teeth, or foot
- **Calculator:** Extension of brain function

Any technology, therefore, is a medium through which we outsource normal human functions. McLuhan maintained that the “message” of any medium is the change of scale, pace, or pattern it introduces into human affairs, creating new social patterns and behaviors.

**Key Concept:**  
_Essentially, we shape our tools, and then they shape us._

#### Consequences for the Church

All tools and techniques—including those the church has used—are not neutral. They impact us deeply. Consider the impact of:

- **Monologue Preaching:** Traditionally, gospel communication has relied almost exclusively on the sermon—a tool borrowed from Greek and Roman rhetoric, not inherently biblical in origin.  
- **Buildings:** Church buildings often create an “us-versus-them” mentality and impact not just how we view others, but also ourselves.

**Research Insight:**  
When church attendees are asked why they come, “community” consistently ranks highest; **preaching consistently ranks much lower**.

#### The Reciprocating Power of Our Tools

- **Film and Entertainment:** These have transformed expectations of communication; people now outsource their imaginations to Hollywood, changing how preachers must engage.
- **Technology Addiction:** Preaching and church experience have become so intertwined that many cannot imagine “church” without a sermon or a building.

#### Buildings: Shaping and Being Shaped

> “We shape our buildings, and then our buildings shape us.”  
> —Paraphrased from McLuhan

Buildings are tools—sometimes vital, but never ends in themselves. When their use blunts our mission, we must question and adapt. For example, reworking or repurposing buildings for missional activities (such as community health centers, cafés, cooperative supermarkets, or gardens) can transform the church’s presence in its community.

## Ministry Development Systems: The Medium of Leadership Formation

Our systems of training leaders—most notably seminaries—have profoundly impacted church life. Typically modeled after academic lecture halls, they reinforce the expert-led, information-transfer model that is mirrored in many church services.

**Key Questions:**

- What is the implicit “message” of the seminary environment?
- Have these tools and techniques unintentionally reinvented the church?

**Alternative Approaches:**  
Internship-based, action-reflection models of theological education (as piloted at Morling Seminary in Sydney) provide a more incarnational, experiential approach to leadership development.

## Embodying the Message: The Integrity of Existence

> “Your actions are speaking so loudly, I can’t hear your words.”
> —Popular dictum

Our lives are continually broadcasting messages, louder than any verbal proclamation. Søren Kierkegaard called this “existence-communication”—the idea that our lives, not just our words, communicate the truth we embody.

> “Hegel builds a magnificent tower but lives in a hut.”  
> —Kierkegaard

Truth must be lived, not just conceptualized. Our actions, including our class status and cultural choices (e.g., cars, houses, education), cannot be separated from our embodiment of the gospel.

**On Being the Message:**  
As Martin Buber recounts, the aim is to make one’s whole life a Torah, a living teaching. The truly righteous (the _zaddikim_) are those whose entire being and actions transmit the teaching.

> “How secondary, indeed how futile, are all the means of communication unless they are actually born out of the very truth they are meant to convey.”  
> —J. V. Taylor

## Beyond the Either/Or Church: Breaking Dualism

Dualism is unconsciously woven into the structure and activity of many churches, typically dividing:

- The “sacred” (worship, prayer, ministry) from
- The “secular” (work, mission, engagement with the world)

This dualistic mindset leads to church experiences that are safe, reassuring, and insulated, setting believers up for a divided spiritual life where God is encountered only in “church” contexts. Sermons often remain conceptual, disconnected from real life.

**Missional-Incarnational-Messianic-Apostolic Mode:**  
Instead, by reorienting the relationship between God, Church, and World, the church becomes a space where all dimensions intermingle at the center. Worship happens in the context of mission; evangelism and social action become communal; spirituality infuses all areas of life.

_Example:_  
**Elevation** (a café project in St. Kilda, Melbourne) exemplifies this convergence, joining God’s people, mission, spirituality, and community in an incarnational, transformative way.

## Partners with God: The Talmudic Riddle

> “If God intended man to live on bread, why didn’t he create a bread tree?”

God prefers partnership over mere accomplishment. He provides the raw materials and invites us to participate in creation. So it is with mission; God invites us to join Him in every sphere, even in places others might deem off-limits.

_Story:_  
John Smith, a prominent Australian evangelist, demonstrated this partnership by ministering in places such as strip clubs, recognizing God already at work, wooing people to Himself. The key missional question: “Can we join God in His mission, wherever we find ourselves?” The answer must be yes—God is always already there.

**Practical Encouragement:**  
It is time to abandon safe enclaves and “fly the coop”—to trust God, get accountable, and step into the world as partners in His mission.

# PART FOUR: The Genius of APEST

> “There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world: and that is an idea whose time has come.”
> —Victor Hugo

## A New Kind of Leadership: From Christendom to Missional Church

The transition to a missional mode of church is impossible without a shift to apostolic leadership. Without this, the church cannot sustain itself for the long term. A new kind of leadership, inspired by Ephesians 4:1–16, is the single most important strategic issue for our time.

### The APEST Model

APEST refers to the five functions described in Ephesians 4:

- **A**postle
- **P**rophet
- **E**vangelist
- **S**hepherd (Pastor)
- **T**eacher

#### The Flow of Paul’s Teaching

1. **Church Unity & Reality** (vv. 1–6): A call to maintain unity amidst diversity.
2. **Christ’s Gifting of His People** (vv. 7, 11, 16): Grace distributed to all believers.
3. **Nature of Ministry**: Unity in diversity, not uniformity.
4. **Ministry/Leadership Matrix (APEST)** (v. 11): The structure for ministry.
5. **Preparation for Service** (v. 12): The reason for APEST.
6. **Growth & Maturity** (vv. 12ff.): The ultimate aim.

**Key Point:**  
The church is gathered around the unity of the Spirit _and_ the diversity of Christ’s gifting. Christ’s act of gracing His people for ministry is at the heart of the church’s mission and structure.

#### Charisma as Function, Not Office

The church’s ministry is fundamentally charismatic—based on God’s empowering grace—superseding institutional office. To recover the full Pauline vision of the church means reintegrating all five giftings (not just shepherds and teachers) into the core life and leadership of the church.

### The Five Ministry Functions: Definitions

- **Apostolic**: Pioneers new missional works and oversees their development (typically translocal).
- **Prophetic**: Discerns spiritual realities and communicates them for mission.
- **Evangelistic**: Communicates the gospel so others respond in faith and discipleship.
- **Shepherding**: Nurtures, protects, and cares for God’s people.
- **Teaching**: Imparts God’s wisdom, enabling obedience to Christ.

These roles are not mutually exclusive and often overlap.

#### The APEST Summary Table

| Function     | Focus            | Potential Myopia          | Impact                |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Apostle      | Extension        | Urgency of tomorrow      | Demands of today      |
| Prophet      | Understanding    | Demands of today         | Direction for tomorrow|
| Evangelist   | Expansion        | Urgency of today         | Demands of today      |
| Shepherd     | Nurture          | Demands of today         | Urgency of tomorrow   |
| Teacher      | Integration      | -                        | Integration of whole  |

*Modified from a diagram by Dwight Smith.*

#### The Dual Matrix: Leadership and Ministry

- **Leadership Matrix:** Describes how APEST functions shape the church’s leadership structure.
- **Ministry Matrix:** Describes how the whole church exercises APEST functions.

As Paul writes, “But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it... It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists and some to be pastors [shepherds] and teachers” (Ephesians 4:7, 11).

**Revolutionary Paradigm:**  
Some are called as apostles, prophets, etc., but the whole community is intended to be apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching in character and ministry.

## Final Challenge

To birth a truly missional-incarnational church, we need new tools, new postures, and the humility to embody what we proclaim. Our lives and structures must communicate the message more powerfully than our words. The call is clear: fly the coop, join God in His mission, and shape both ourselves and our tools for the flourishing of God’s kingdom.
