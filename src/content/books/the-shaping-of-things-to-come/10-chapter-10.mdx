---# Imagination and Leadership: Cultivating Paradigm Shifts

> **"The real revolutionary, perhaps the only one, is the person who has nothing left to lose."**

## Introduction

Leaders seeking to catalyze true paradigm shifts in their organizations or communities often encounter resistance—not because their solutions lack merit, but because the underlying problems have not been adequately communicated. The following insights offer practical and provocative approaches for leaders aspiring to spearhead missional and transformational change.

## Provoking Holy Dissatisfaction

A foundational weapon in any revolutionary leader's arsenal is cultivating a sense of **holy dissatisfaction**—provoking a deep, sanctified discontent with the status quo and awakening a yearning for what could be. 

- *Holy* dissatisfaction must stay grounded in virtue, lest it devolve into negative agitation. The old Marxist slogan, “Rub raw the sores of discontent,” reveals the revolutionary power of stirring unrest—a tactic as relevant for missional leadership as for insurrection.
- Effective leaders must risk unpopularity to effect paradigmatic change, especially in entrenched environments like Christendom, where apostolic renewal often requires real disruption.

## The Art of Subversive Questioning

One of the most invaluable tools for reconceptualizing ministry and mission is **subversive questioning**. Radical, creative questioning forces self-awareness and invites personal exploration of answers. As seen in the practice of advertising, dissatisfaction is often generated to create demand; likewise, leaders can use questions to create a hunger for change.

### Why Questioning Matters

- **Socratic Method:** Socrates exemplified the power of questions over answers—questioning is far more revolutionary.
- In organizational development, the addition of reflective questioning to habitual programming fosters real learning.

### Examples of Subversive Questions

Consider the following questions that provoke deeper thought:

- **Is a can opener a can opener if it can’t open cans?**  
  Addresses the distinction between form and function. Analogously:  
  *Is the church still a church if it doesn’t function like one?*
- **If you could start all over again, would you do it the same way?**  
  If not, *why* are you persisting with the current model?
- **What would your church experience be like if:**  
  - You no longer had a building?  
  - You couldn't meet on Sundays?  
  - You had no pastor or clear leadership team?  
  These questions challenge us to strip away Christendom's trappings and return to New Testament essentials.

**Recommendation:** Develop a repertoire of such questions, use parables and storytelling as Jesus did, and encourage participative, biblical reflection.

## Becoming a Beginner Again

To evoke creativity, leaders must cultivate a "beginner’s mind" rather than relying on expert paradigms.

- **Unlearning:** Much of what is "known" must be unlearned. Practice unlearning alongside learning.
- **Playfulness:** Recover the playful, open-mindedness of childhood. Children use objects—like chairs—in many imaginative ways; adults restrict themselves to a single purpose (associative thinking). Embracing play opens new possibilities in community, mission, and ministry.

> **"One of the most important lessons from history is that renewal of the church always comes from the fringes."**

Be willing to learn from the “fringes” of the church. Historically, vibrant renewal emerges from the margins—not the center—and from those typically marginalized.

## Valuing Mavericks, Eccentrics, and Risk Takers

Echoing John Stuart Mill: *"Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded."*

- **Marginalized individuals** and mavericks often bring renewal and prophetic critique to the community.
- True biblical mavericks—like Jesus—challenge dominant paradigms and expose communal illusions.
- While such individuals may be challenging, leaders should listen for God's truth within their perspectives.

## The Power of Risk and Lateral Thinking

Growth and creativity demand risk-taking. When operating outside comfort zones, individuals and organizations are compelled to learn and adapt.

- **Edward de Bono:** *"You cannot dig a hole in a different place by digging more in the same place."*  
  Lateral thinking emphasizes seeking alternatives and shifting perspectives, contrary to organizational insanity—believing better results can come from doing the same things "better".

---

## Creating a Climate for Change

Sustainable innovation requires a supportive ecology for creativity. Leaders must:

- **Value imagination and creativity** as essential resources.
- Provide organizational permission for rethinking and experimentation, accepting that this journey will be chaotic and may include failures.
- **Diversity:** Balance left-brained (rational) and right-brained (creative) individuals in leadership teams.
- **Preparedness to Act Boldly:** Encourage practices that promote alternate thinking and risk.

### Practical Challenges for Leaders

- **Ask a fool:** Break out of echoes of affirmation by inviting parody and satire.
- **Break routine:** Try something unconventional to inspire new thinking.
- **Learn from mistakes:** Errors are natural pathways to learning.
- **Challenge assumptions:** Identify which rules should be examined and potentially broken.
- **Combine ideas:** Merge unrelated concepts as Gutenberg did to invent the printing press.
- **Dig deeper:** The best ideas often emerge from generating many ideas.

## Stimulating Creativity: Insights from "Built To Last"

James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras recommend:

- **Relentless self-improvement:** "Good enough never is."
- **Try lots of experiments; keep what works.**
- **Accept mistakes.** Failure is integral to the creative process.
- **Adopt a genius:** Learn from great thinkers and role models.
- **Brainstorm:** Properly facilitated brainstorming produces both quantity and quality of ideas.
- **Take notes:** Keep a constant record of ideas; even if many are impractical, the valuable ones will emerge.
- **Embrace restrictions:** Sometimes, constraints enhance creativity.
- **Define your problem precisely** to unlock solutions.

## Edward de Bono’s Six Thinking Hats

This social-thinking tool encourages diverse problem-solving approaches by "wearing" different thinking hats, each representing a mode of thought. While participants speak from perspectives they don't normally occupy, egos are protected and creativity is unleashed.

### The Six Hats

- **White Hat:** Neutral, data-driven thinking ("What information do we have/missing?")
- **Red Hat:** Emotional response, intuition ("My gut feeling is...")
- **Black Hat:** Caution and risk assessment ("Why something can't be done.")

*The practice can extend to any group problem-solving context, including Bible study.*

## Organizing the Revolution: Strategy and Commitment

> **"If what you’re doing isn’t irrevocable, then you don’t have a strategy—because anyone can do it."**  
> —Troy Tyler

Apostolic leadership flourishes when the church rediscovers itself as a missionary movement—organized for purpose, fluid in form, and perpetually oriented around Jesus.

# The Nature and Dynamics of Movements

Movements comprise groups organized for, and committed to, initiating personal or social change, recruiting others, and spreading influence in opposition to established orders.

### Common Characteristics of Movements

**(from Howard Snyder, Signs of the Spirit):**
- Thirst for renewal: Holy discontent propels a return to vibrant early church patterns.
- Emphasis on the Holy Spirit’s work—past and present.
- Tension with existing institutions.
- Countercultural community: Radical commitment and active tension with the world.
- Nontraditional leadership: Led by charismatic, often nonordained individuals, including women.
- Ministry to the poor and marginalized.
- Energy and dynamism: Ability to excite and mobilize others.

**(from Gerlach & Hine, sociological perspective):**
- Segmented, cellular structures held together relationally.
- Recruitment via significant face-to-face relationships.
- Personal commitment fostered by conversion-like separation.
- Strong, coherent ideology uniting diverse segments.
- Real (or perceived) opposition from established order.
- Nontraditional leadership and mass-level participation.

### Key Insights

- Movements begin on the margins and among common people, emphasizing nonelitist participation and charismatic leadership.
- Established institutions resist the chaos and dynamism of movements, making permission-giving from leadership crucial for systemic revitalization.

# Jesus at the Center: Centered Set Organizing

**Set Theory for Communities:**
- **Bounded Set:** Hard boundaries, soft center. Membership defined by rules more than core passion (e.g., traditional denominations).
- **Fuzzy Set:** Soft boundaries, soft center. Lacks purpose and cohesion; often short-lived or in decline.
- **Centered Set:** Hard center (shared core belief/vision), soft edges. Diverse participants gathered around a common center (e.g., Jesus).

## Leadership Implications

- **Jesus is the epicenter.** Diverse expressions and forms are welcome at the “edges,” but the core remains Christ-centered.
- Instead of striving for conformity through boundaries, cultivate hunger and guide people toward the “well” at the center.

# Eco-Leadership and Organic Structures

Leaders should shape communities as organic, living systems—responsive, interconnected, and true to their dynamic essence.

- **Smaller, organic communities** are more authentic, relational, and missionally effective, though larger churches have a role to play in a diverse ecclesial ecosystem.
- Avoid over-programming; genuine community emerges from rhythms and ecology, not automation.
- Observe social rhythms and indigenous patterns within communities. Don’t import artificial models—grow the church contextually.
- Embrace **metabolic growth** (multiplication through reproduction) rather than mere addition. Like living systems, healthy churches multiply organically.

---

# Ideaviruses and Multiplicative Growth

Borrowing from Seth Godin:
- **Ideaviruses**—contagious ideas—spread rapidly and fundamentally change groups and cultures. For the gospel, this means finding the right media and mechanisms to let the message "go viral."
- **Reproducibility** is essential. Living systems ensure their future through embedded potential for reproduction; churches must be designed with multiplication at their core.

---

# Conclusion

Transformative, missional leadership requires more than incremental change or better programming. It calls for holy dissatisfaction, subversive questioning, playful creativity, learning from the margins, risk-taking, and organizing around a compelling Christ-centered core. The aim is not only to revitalize existing communities but to birth and multiply dynamic, diverse, organic movements attuned to the Spirit and relevant to the complexity of the contemporary world.
