---# Contextualization and Mission

> “When we take a close look at its pages ... we note that the Scriptures are contextual from beginning to end.”
> —Orlando Costas

Missionaries have often imposed Western culture on Two-Thirds-World nations, presenting it as the standard expression of Christianity. However, the gospel message in Scripture is for all peoples, nations, and subcultures. While originally expressed in the Jewish and Greco-Roman cultural contexts of the first century, God’s message must be translated across cultures—a challenging process known as contextualization.

## Biblical Examples of Contextualization

The Bible itself is an example of divine contextualization. An eternal, omnipotent God chose to communicate through human language and imagery, reaching into human longings and fears—demonstrating that God is the ultimate contextualizer.

Charles Kraft highlights four principles illustrating contextualization in the Bible:

1. **Beyond Intellectual Truth**  
   The Bible communicates more than information; it demonstrates *how* truth is conveyed. As Kraft notes, God is “a God of dialogue who interacts with us, not simply a God of monologue who makes pronouncements above us.”

2. **Communication in Familiar Ways**  
   God’s messages come through familiar and expected forms, even though the content itself may be unexpected.

3. **Participatory Self-Disclosure**  
   God’s revelation is participatory; He engages humans in the process.

4. **Situation-Specific Revelation**  
   God’s revelatory activity is shaped by the particular situations and cultures in which it occurs.

If we accept these principles, we must recognize the biblical writers’ role in contextualizing divine truth. The process of transmitting the message is recorded alongside the message itself. God reveals Himself at Sinai in thunder and lightning, and in Paul’s letters through reasoned argument—each context shows different expressions of revelation.  

The Incarnation stands as the most profound example of contextual self-revelation. As Karl Barth states, in the Incarnation both the true self of God and the true identity of humanity are revealed. This makes contextualization essential for communicating the Christian message. Evangelism, then, must use contextual methods to point people to a God who reveals Himself contextually.

## The Process of Contextualization

### Hiebert’s Four-Step Model

Paul Hiebert (1987) proposed a four-step framework for *critical contextualization*:

1. **Examine the Host Culture**  
   Conduct a serious study and understanding of the culture being reached.

2. **Commit to Biblical Authority**  
   Emphasize a clear understanding of the Bible. Both leaders and congregants must grasp the biblical message as originally intended. While leaders need the skills to move between cultures, all must be involved in studying Scripture.

3. **Critically Evaluate Customs**  
   The congregation evaluates its own customs in light of new biblical understanding, deciding how to respond to these truths together. Leadership can provide insight, but ultimately, people must make the final decisions.

4. **Decide on Practices**  
   Guided by Scripture and the Spirit, the community determines which customs to keep, modify, or reject.

#### Responses to Old Customs

- **Keep That Which Is Not Unbiblical**  
  Neutral cultural practices can be retained to reaffirm cultural identity.

- **Reject That Which Is Unbecoming for Christians**  
  Practices clearly contradicting Christian faith should be rejected.

- **Modify Practices for Christian Meaning**  
  Former customs may be modified to reflect Christian truths (e.g., adapting existing music or rituals).

- **Replace with Biblically Appropriate Alternatives**  
  Some customs (such as cohabitation) are replaced with structures more consistent with Christian values.

- **Adopt Historic Christian Rites**  
  Rites like baptism and communion should be contextualized to the local culture.

- **Create New Symbols and Rituals**  
  Develop fresh expressions suitable to the local context (e.g., hand signals, slogans, distinctive art).

After this process, the congregation arranges their chosen, modified, and created practices into new rituals expressing Christian meaning in their context. This process doesn’t create a new template, but rather informs and celebrates the diverse forms of the missional-incarnational church.

# Levels of Contextualization: The C1–C6 Spectrum

Phil Parshall and John Travis have provided a practical spectrum (C1 to C6) for Christ-centered communities, helping churches discern appropriate contextualization. Though designed for Muslim contexts, these types are found in Western settings as well.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **C1** | Traditional church; outsider language (e.g., English), imported symbols, large cultural gap. Believers call themselves "Christians." |
| **C2** | Traditional church; insider language, but still distinctive Christian vocabulary; cultural gap remains. Believers call themselves "Christians." |
| **C3** | Contextualized community; insider language and neutral cultural forms (music, dress, art). Believers call themselves "Christians." |
| **C4** | Contextualized community; insider language, Biblically permissible Islamic forms (prayer posture, fasting, dress). Believers identify as "followers of Isa the Messiah." |
| **C5** | Communities of "Messianic Muslims"; fully inside legal and social Muslim framework, rejecting or reinterpreting unbiblical elements; may attend mosques. Believers see themselves as Muslims who follow Isa the Messiah. |
| **C6** | Secret/underground believers; worship Christ privately, often unrecognized by the surrounding community, but identify as Muslims. |

Most Western churches remain at the C1 or C2 level, with a few exploring deeper contextualization (C3–C5).

### Avoiding Syncretism

Missiologists warn against syncretism—subordinating the gospel to culture. To guard against this, both Travis and Hiebert highlight:

- Commitment to biblical authority
- Recognition of the Holy Spirit among all believers
- Viewing the church as a hermeneutical community
- Operating within a global network of churches for accountability

Mission in a post-Christian West demands similar rigor, calling churches to seriously contextualize the gospel for new cultural realities.

# Whispering to the Soul: Spiritual Engagement

> “Contrary to Western thought, spirituality is anything but reasonable and practical.”  
> —Jeff Woods

Contemporary spirituality is often found outside traditional church walls. When facing profound existential crises, people rarely turn to the institutional church for answers. Instead, they seek meaning through a variety of spiritual experiences.

## Testimonies of Spiritual Seeking

### Ruth Ostrow

A journalist, Ruth Ostrow sought solace after losing a loved one. Finding no comfort in “sensible” explanations of death, she experienced spiritual encounters through dreams, nature, and gatherings with others on a similar quest. Traditional church responses often seem inadequate to such unchurched spiritualities and existential longing.

### Marty Kaplan

Screenwriter Marty Kaplan found in meditation a spiritual awakening, despite approaching it only for stress relief. He describes an ambush by spirituality—experiencing the presence of God through silence and meditation, outside institutional religion.

These stories illustrate that spiritual growth often occurs amidst pain, struggle, and doubt. Spirituality is not satisfied by doctrine or formula, but by shared journeys and honest encounters.

# Whispering, Not Shouting: Lessons from the Horse Whisperer

Monty Roberts, the “man who listens to horses,” discovered that building trust with mustangs was more effective than breaking their spirit. By respectfully engaging their instincts, rather than crushing them, Roberts could “whisper” them into cooperation.

Similarly, the church has often tried to “break” seekers with hard truths, rather than gently engaging them. True spiritual guidance requires listening, presence, and genuine friendship, rather than manipulation or coercion.

### The Skills of the Whisperer

- **Listening** is indispensable.
- Recognize that most people come to faith gradually rather than via dramatic conversions.
- Models of evangelism should help people along this gradual process.

#### Features of Whispering Ministry

- **Storytelling**: Jesus engaged people with parables—stories that provoked curiosity, not mere information transfer. As John Drane writes, effective evangelism overlaps God’s story, our stories, and Scripture.
- **Wonder and Awe**: Experiencing creation, art, beauty, and mystery draws people toward God. Worship should evoke awe and not be stripped of evocative or mysterious elements.
- **Extraordinary Love**: Acts of grace and compassion can transform and attract. Loving, sacrificial community impresses even non-believers.
- **Exploring God’s Work**: Recognize and name God’s activity in everyday life—moments of beauty, overcome challenges, relationships.
- **Focus on Jesus**: Strip away religious trappings to present Jesus in his authentic, first-century Jewish context. His relational, action-oriented faith, use of parables, and scandalous love resonate deeply when shared honestly.

# Exploring Messianic Spirituality

> “Scripture forms a commentary on everyday life—as much as everyday life brings with it fresh understandings of Scripture.”
> —Jacob Neusner

An incarnational ministry excites curiosity, provokes awe, shows love, explores God’s work, and focuses on Jesus. To truly incarnate Christ within host cultures, we must engage with his life and teaching afresh, awakening deep passion and discovering a redemptive framework for mission.

Spirituality, for too long the domain of monastic or abstract mysticism, needs relocating in real, lived engagement with the world. Incarnational ministry requires a spirituality that energizes and sustains meaningful mission.
