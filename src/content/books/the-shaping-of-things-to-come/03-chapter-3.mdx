## Mending Nets: A Metaphor for Mission

Jesus’ fishing disciples spent most of their working day not out on the lake, but on shore, mending their nets. If their nets were strong and tight, anything caught in them couldn’t escape. Relating this image to the missional-incarnational church provides significant insight. Rather than requiring Christians to leave a "sacred zone" to bring others back, it releases the church to see its "fishing" as a fundamentally relational exercise.

If the disciples spent so much time mending their nets to ensure a catch, what are our nets today? We propose that the web of relationships, friendships, and acquaintances that Christians naturally develop forms the net into which not-yet-Christians will swim. The missional-incarnational church consequently invests more in building friendships than in developing programs.

Charles Ringma (Philippines Theological Seminary) observes:

> “A telling example is where a church committee develops a special plan for service and action by the church in the community and then tries to sell it to church members for their involvement and support... This is the official project. Most church members can relate to this aspect of the attractional church.”  
> —Charles Ringma

Typically, church leadership decides on programs—often borrowed from elsewhere—which then consume all energy and resources. These transplanted initiatives, even if sound and effective in their original context, often feel artificial because they are not indigenous or locally-grown.

Ringma continues:

> “But no thought is given to establish what church members are already doing in their neighborhoods and places of work. No attempt is made, for example, to identify the medical practitioner who... provides counseling and practical support rather than just curative care. No attempt is made to support the teacher starting work in an inner-city school, or the family caring for their disabled child as a ministry worthy of the church’s support and prayers.”

Beyond this, the church frequently fails to recognize the missional roles of businessmen, students, youth workers, lecturers, tradespeople, and homemakers in their spheres. For instance, a businessman's prayer breakfast may be supported by the church, but using business influence to serve the needy or create jobs is rarely recognized as mission.

Similarly, friendships made through schools or at the local beach are disconnected from the idea of mission unless directly tied to church invitations. The web of relationships Christians develop—if nurtured—becomes the net that catches people into God's kingdom.

## The Dual Stance: Inward and Outward Focus

Leonard Sweet highlights the church’s common posture: Christians stand shoulder-to-shoulder, facing inward. When asked to face outward, they do so, yet neither position fully reflects the church's call. Sweet suggests standing with one shoulder to the center and the other facing out—a posture that is both inward and outward looking. This physical metaphor serves as a reminder of the church’s missionary stance.

## Birds of a Feather: Group Dynamics in the Church

In his book on the church, Jurgen Moltmann identifies the “birds of a feather flock together” principle as underlying the attractional church. When the church is seen as separate from the world, it inevitably develops an "us-versus-them" mentality. The missional-incarnational church, however, envisions itself as a permeating community—a “go-to-them” stance. This model cannot abide the comfort of sameness.

Moltmann writes:

> “‘Birds of a feather flock together.’ But why? People who are like us... confirm us. People who are different from us... make us feel insecure. Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.”  
> —Jurgen Moltmann (Rom. 15:7)

The acceptance of others is not mere advice; it is rooted in Christ’s acceptance of us. This liberates Christians from self-justification, opening them to genuine relationships and interest in others.

## Wells and Fences: Centered and Bounded Sets

Distinguishing between "centered sets" and "bounded sets" is central in understanding church models:

- **Bounded Set:** Defines clear borders—who is "in" or "out" (e.g., membership rolls).
- **Centered Set:** Defined by core values; everyone is viewed in relation to the center. People are not in or out, but closer or farther from the center.

### Metaphor: Wells and Fences

In some farming communities, fences keep livestock in (bounded set). On vast ranges, animals are kept close by a well (centered set), as they will not stray far from water. For the church, Christ is the well—the source. People naturally position themselves closer or further away, but all are included in the scope of community.

Jesus’ faith community was a centered set, with varying proximity to the center (e.g., Peter, James, and John were particularly close). Likewise, the modern church should prioritize relationships over numbers, recognizing both Christians and "not-yet-Christians" as part of its network.

---

## Characteristics of Centered-Set Churches

- **Core beliefs rooted in Christ and his teaching.**
- **Emphasis on belonging.**
- **Valuing the journey towards Christlikeness, not just arrival.**
- **Recognizing all are equally fallen.**
- **Evangelism focuses on relationship, not boundary crossing.**

The process of discipleship is understood as moving ever closer to the center (Christ), with belonging and growth prioritized over external conformity.

## Rethinking Evangelism

Bounded-set evangelism focuses on moving people “in” to the religious zone. The centered-set church, while still inviting participation in Christian community, emphasizes a cross-cultural, "go-to-them" mentality. The aim is to encourage the search for Christ, not simply to present information.

Vincent Donovan summarizes this approach:

> “Do not try to call them back to where they were, and do not try to call them to where you are... you must have the courage to go with them to a place that neither you nor they have ever been before.”  
> —Vincent J. Donovan

### Table: Bounded-Set vs. Centered-Set Approaches

| Bounded-Set Approach                                                        | Centered-Set Approach                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The evangelizer is the expert; the lost must be brought “in”.               | Each person is the expert on his/her own life; the evangelizer respects this. |
| Focuses on lost/saved; tries to “fix up” sinners.                           | Sees people as seekers; stimulates questions and recognizes mutual learning. |
| The “lost” person is viewed as flawed and sinful.                           | Each is created in God's image—loved and valued.                            |
| Goal: Get converts into the team. Conversion is a dramatic event.           | Goal: Encourage discovery; conversion is seen as an ongoing process.         |
| Christians claim full knowledge of the truth.                               | Humility and wonder; recognizes we do not know everything.                   |

## Incarnational Outreach: Practical Example

Consider Adam and Amy, a young Christian couple, welcomed into a skydivers’ community. In the attractional mode, outreach would mean organizing a church-based event for skydivers. In the incarnational model, Adam and Amy would join the club, eat with them, and build relationships—forming an embedded Christian presence within that subculture.

## Homogeneity and Mission: The HUP Debate

The Homogeneous Unit Principle (HUP), developed in the 1970s, asserts that people respond best in culturally similar groups. Critics like David Bosch warn against the dangers of churches becoming homogeneous ghettos. While recognizing this risk, we argue that heterogeneity is primarily a discipleship issue, not a missional one.

### Case Study: St Thomas Crookes Church, Sheffield

St Thomas Crookes balances homogeneity and diversity through a three-tier structure:

1. **Cells**: Homogeneous, missional units focused on specific subcultures or groups.
2. **Congregations**: Clusters of cells (up to 100), less homogeneous, gathering weekly for worship and teaching.
3. **Celebration Gatherings**: Large, diverse worship events (up to 2,000), providing space for vision and unity.

Discipleship and mission primarily occur at the cell level, affirming the need for missionally focused, contextually adapted groups.

## A Biblical Approach to Incarnational Evangelism

If the church is to be incarnational and missional, it must rediscover the biblical pattern for engaging the world:

### Key Commitments for Incarnational Infiltration

1. **Holy living**:  
   > “Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.”  
   > —Matthew 5:16

   Holiness must be broad—marked by justice, mercy, and humility, not merely abstinence.

2. **Prayer**:
   - Pray for God to raise up evangelists.
   - Pray for blessing and effectiveness in evangelistic ministry.
   - Pray for the salvation of not-yet-Christian friends and neighbors.

3. **Proximity and Relationship**:
   Christians should live, work, and socialize closely with the wider community, integrating faith into daily life and relationships.

4. **Supporting Evangelists**:
   Incarnational churches should free and support gifted evangelists to work relationally in their contexts, just as Paul urges churches to support those who preach the gospel (1 Cor. 9:13–14).

---

## Jesus-Talk in Everyday Life

While the evangelist’s role is to proclaim the gospel, all believers are exhorted to speak of Jesus naturally in conversation:

> “Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect.”  
> —1 Peter 3:15

As relationships deepen, opportunities for "Jesus-talk" should arise organically—during shared experiences of joy, suffering, or reflection.

## The Shape of the Missional Church: Lessons from “Chocolat”

For a vivid illustration, consider the film *Chocolat*. In a French village overshadowed by ascetic, authoritarian religion (the Comte de Reynaud), Vianne Rocher arrives and opens a chocolaterie at the edge of town. Rather than imposing programs, she builds transformative relationships, offering warmth, acceptance, and celebration of life. Through her presence, honesty, and practical help, Vianne rehabilitates the broken and restores the community—capturing the incarnational, relational nature of Christian mission.

---

## If We Could Start Again

Church revitalization often begins with the question, “If you could start over from scratch, would you do it the same way?” Most respond “No,” but few make substantive changes. Deep transformation requires adopting an organic, context-sensitive, and relational approach rather than repeating inherited patterns.

### Listening to Your Patients

Authentic communal life emerges when the church listens to and lives among the people it seeks to reach. The model must be responsive to the community’s rhythms and needs, seeking to redeem existing culture rather than imposing something foreign.

- Live, work, and socialize within the local community.
- Build genuine, intersecting friendships.
- Be attentive to "persons of peace"—those open to partnership and spiritual conversations (see Luke 10).

---

## Summary: Pattern of Incarnational Mission

1. **Live, eat, and work closely with the community**, building strong relational nets.
2. **Demonstrate holy lifestyle**—generosity, justice, love, humility, and compassion.
3. **Sustain ongoing prayer** for friends and for more evangelists.
4. **Support and integrate evangelists** contextually in community life.
5. **Speak of Jesus naturally** as opportunities arise within relationships.

Through these commitments, the church becomes a living, relational witness to the gospel in a post-Christendom culture.
