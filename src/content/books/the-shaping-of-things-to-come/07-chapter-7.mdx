---# The Sacredness of Action: Intention, Passion, and the Hallowing of the Everyday

> "He who does a good deed with complete kavanah, that is, completes an act in such a way that his whole existence is gathered in it and directed in it towards God, he works on the redemption of the world, on its conquest for God."  
> —Martin Buber

## Intention and the Inner Meaning of Actions

The concept of intention imbues actions with their inner meaning. As Maurice Friedman observes in his definitive biography of Martin Buber, kavanah (in its Kabbalistic form) represents the deliberate concentration of will—an inner attitude which is more effective than the particular nature of the action being performed. In its Hasidic development, kavanah shifts from magical intention to a general consecration, a dedication people bring to all their actions:

> "The Hasidic kavanah signifies less an effort of the will centered on the attainment of a definite end than the purposeful direction of the whole being in accordance with some feeling springing up in the depths of one's nature. Without kavanah, no service of God has any value, for right (moral) action is dependent on the intensity of inner religious feeling. Thus Hasidism does not recognize any division between religion and ethics, nor is its ethics limited to any prescribed and peculiar action."  
> —Friedman, 21

Buber elaborates that the sanctity of an act is achieved not by its content, but by the God-oriented intent behind it. Every passion can be transformed into virtue; every inclination is a potential "vehicle of God." It is the intensity and direction of the soul which makes a deed holy.

This theme is profoundly biblical. Scriptural ethics have always emphasized motive and intentionality. Yet, too often, we have lacked the theological framework to appreciate how our everyday actions can participate in redemption.

## The Two Inclinations: Good and Evil

In Jewish teaching, the soul is comprised of two inclinations: the good inclination (yetzer hatov) and the evil inclination (yetzer hara). The good inclination leads us toward God, channeling the directed forces of the soul. The evil inclination, however, is simply passion left undirected—not inherently evil, but dangerous if not oriented toward God.

Significantly, Judaism teaches that we must even worship God with the evil inclination:

> "The Mishnah interprets the phrase ‘Thou shall love the Lord your God with all thy heart’ to mean with both your inclinations, the ‘good’ and the ‘evil’; that is, with and by your decision, so that the ardor of passion is converted and enters into the unified deed with all its strength. For no inclination is evil in itself; it is made evil by man when he surrenders to it instead of controlling it."  
> —Buber, 173

Maurice Friedman summarizes:

> "Passion means that one does not suppress one’s humanity before bringing oneself into relation with others, but, on the contrary, directs one’s ‘evil’ urge into that relationship in such a way that, without losing its force, it ceases to be evil."  
> —Friedman, 23

A lower passion can only be overcome by a greater passion; redemption requires holy passion. As C.S. Lewis notes in *The Great Divorce*:

> "There is but one good; that is God. Everything else is good when it looks to Him and bad when it turns from Him."

## Integrating the Body and Passion into Faith

Western Christianity is prone to dualism, often neglecting bodily drives and passions. The Hebraic tradition, however, seeks to harness these forces for their intended, creational purposes. Failing to integrate aspects like sexuality into faith can result in experiencing them as destructive. Saint John of the Cross affirms:

> "The strength of the soul comprises the faculties, passions, and appetites. All this strength is ruled by the will. When the will directs these faculties, passions, and appetites towards God, turning away from all that is not God, the soul presents its strength for God, and comes to love Him with all its might."  
> —Saint John of the Cross

For Hebraic spirituality, every aspect of the self—including sexuality—must be brought under God’s direction. This approach leads to a vigorous, passionate faithfulness.

## Hallowing the Everyday

Closely related to intention (kavanah) is the hallowing of the everyday. The Hebraic worldview recognizes only two realities: the holy and the not-yet-holy. The task of God’s people is to transform the not-yet-holy into the holy by directing every deed toward God, infusing ordinary life with intentionality and sanctity.

Every act, no matter how mundane, can become an occasion of holiness:

> "When one eats in holiness… the table becomes an altar. When one works in holiness, he raises up the sparks that hide themselves in all tools. When one walks in holiness across the field, the soft songs of all herbs … enter into the song of our soul. When a husband is united with his wife in holiness, then the Shekinah rests over them."
>
> "If you explore the life of things and of conditioned being you come to the unfathomable. If you deny the life of things and of conditioned being you stand before nothingness. If you hallow this life you meet the living God."  
> —Martin Buber

Holiness, then, actively fills all of life. Faith is not defined by what we avoid, but by what we actively hallow.

## Faith and Faithfulness: Emunah vs. Pistis

A critical difference between Hebraic and Hellenistic worldviews lies in their understanding of faith:

- **Emunah** (Hebrew): Active faith, best rendered as "faithfulness" or "active trust," rooted in action and relationship.
- **Pistis** (Greek): Focuses on intellectual assent and propositional belief.

Western Christianity has typically emphasized pistis, sometimes at the expense of emunah. A return to active trust—lived faithfulness—is essential for a vibrant, missional Christian life. Our evangelism must offer not just doctrine but a lived, relational encounter with Christ.

## Action as Sacrament

> "Christians have often disputed as to whether what leads the Christian home is good actions or Faith in Christ. It does seem to me like asking which blade in a pair of scissors is most necessary."  
> —C.S. Lewis

A messianic spirituality calls the church to recover the ability to see God in the so-called ordinary world of action. Christian activism, when done with holy intention and in Jesus' name, becomes a sacrament—a visible means of grace both to the recipient and the actor.

Martin Buber puts it succinctly:

> "Something infinite flows into a (holy) deed of a man; something infinite flows from it ... the fullness of the world's destiny, namelessly interwoven, passes through his hands."

Just as the Lord’s Supper and baptism are sacraments, so too are the holy deeds done in God's name.

### Redemptive Action

Redemptive action reflects the very nature of God: to redeem what is lost and restore it to its intended purpose. From alleviating suffering to engaging with culture—through art, literature, or social action—redemption is possible and necessary:

- **Redemption by Power:** Deliverance through decisive action.
- **Redemption by Purchase:** Deliverance through self-sacrifice.

All aspects of life and culture can be redeemed and directed to the glory of God.

### The Sacramental Value of the Human Deed

Jewish tradition highlights the revelatory dimension of sacred action:

> "From within his own deed, man as well as nation hears the voice of God."  
> —Talmudic saying

The New Testament echoes this:

- "Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven." (Matt. 5:16)
- "Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God..." (1 Pet. 2:12)
- "If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides..." (1 Pet. 4:11)

When acts of kindness and godliness are performed, the glory of God becomes visible. Our actions are not extraneous to our spirituality—they are its very expression.

## Are We Saved by Good Works?

While justification is by God's grace through faith alone, as Paul rightly insists, our deeds retain inherent value. Not as the basis of salvation, but as outflow and evidence of the life of faith. If actions were not significant, why do they feature so prominently in final judgment (e.g., 1 Cor. 3:10–15; Matt. 12:36–37; Rev. 20; John 5:27–30)?

We are not saved by our actions, but we are known by them. Jesus said his disciples would be known by their love for one another.

### The Parable of Menashe

S. Y. Agnon's tale of Menashe illustrates this truth: when Menashe, a deeply kind man, sells the rabbi’s letter affirming his name for quick gain, he effectively loses his name—his identity. Only through an act of sacrificial love does he regain it. Our actions mirror our true selves; to live like Christ is to retain our Christian identity.

## The Integration of Inward and Outward Obedience

A deed benefits others, but without the devotion of the heart to God, it will not benefit the doer. God is concerned with right living—encompassing motive, action, and holistic obedience. Rabbi Abraham Heschel observes:

> “Is it the artist’s inner vision, or his wrestling with the stone that brings forth a sculpture? Right living is like a work of art, the product of both an inner vision and a wrestling with concrete situations.”

Actions are incomplete without both inner intention and outward performance. Discipline is intended to keep us open and attentive to God.

## Just Do It: From Reflection to Missional Action

While practices of contemplation and withdrawal are vital, mature discipleship cannot remain passive. The imbalance must be redressed; faith grows through rhythms of both receptivity and activity. As someone noted, "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."

Buber writes:

> "To do the good deed is to fill the world with God; to serve God in truth is to draw Him into life."

For faith to have substance, it must issue forth as action. Heschel frames it thus:

> "Action is truth. The deed is the elucidation of existence, expressing thirst for God with body and soul... The mitzvoth are the Jewish sacraments, sacraments that may be performed in common acts of kindness."

The Epistle of James resonates with this:

> "Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world." (James 1:27)

Mission, then, is a task that defines our name and purpose.

## Momentum and Spirituality

A helpful analogy is that of sailing—a boat with momentum, perfectly adjusted to the wind, is truly free; when stalled, it is "in irons." So too with Christian life: a body in motion tends to stay in motion. Action creates spiritual momentum, and reflective practices are most fruitful within this context.

## Missional Implications: Action as the Center of Community

A shift toward active spirituality brings profound implications:

- Missional churches engage fully in life—evangelism, community work, causes, public spaces.
- Sacred action allows all to participate around a common good.
- Activities—art, discussions, service—become points of convergence for believers and seekers.
- Buildings and resources are adapted for multi-use, rooting the church in its locale and inviting wider participation.

Experiences such as arts activism illustrate how action can form the center of a community, providing contexts for grace and mission, even among those not yet Christians.

## The Medium Really Is the Message

> "Everything is fine, but the ship is still heading in the wrong direction."  
> —Edward de Bono

A renewed, missional spirituality requires envisioning and living out an alternative reality of communal Christian life. Like Ginger in *Chicken Run*, true leaders see beyond "the way things have always been" and dare to act upon new visions.

True freedom lies in the soul; only a spirituality that can nurture alternative communal life will break the shackles of dying Christendom. This spirituality must be both missional and evangelistic, modeling itself after Jesus and the early church.

## Who I Am Will Determine What I Do

Central to messianic spirituality is the transformation of identity. In Christ, believers are made new—children of God, saints, inheritors of the kingdom. The New Testament documents this pattern: the indicative (who we are) precedes the imperative (how we live). Our new identity in Christ shapes our actions.

For example, if someone identifies as a chef, they cook; as an athlete, they train. Likewise, our spiritual identity compels corresponding action. Embracing a missionary identity inspires practical engagement in the world, beyond the confines of institutional religion.
