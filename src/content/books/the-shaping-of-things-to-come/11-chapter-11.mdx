---creatures. If fruitfulness is missing, the survival of the species is under real threat. In other words, if the animal or the tree is not reproducible, then something has gone wrong. We believe that we should apply the same test to churches and church life. We believe that churches that fail to reproduce organically actually fail the intention of the gospel implicit in the very gospel itself. The gospel is essentially a message (a seed, an ideavirus?) to be passed on; failure to pass it on results in infertility for the church in any given context. The Bible is full of images that relate to fruitfulness (and resultant blessing) or fruitlessness (and appropriate judgment.) For instance John 15 and many of Jesus’ parables raise the issue directly and unavoidably. We must be willing to ask hard questions in relation to our current systems if we are being unfruitful. Sustainability is the final component of the ecology of healthy missional leadership and structuring. If organic growth ensures the right inner life and appropriate structure for the missional church, and reproducibility ensures that the church remains true to the gospel and missionally honest, sustainability ensures that the church keeps itself on task over the long haul. Thinking in terms of sustainability as a fundamental assumption of pioneering leadership means that the leaders must pay serious attention to how the organization can take root, grow, and flourish over the long term in any given context. Furthermore, it means that leadership must look at ways in which to sustain the organization through all phases of its life cycle. The organization’s ongoing response-ability is always kept in mind. The business world is good at this because it simply has to be. If a company fails in this area, it ceases to exist. Pain and difficulty faced by healthy business systems actually become wonderful teachers, forcing the leadership and the organization to respond and therefore adapt to new situations and challenges. Having to engage daily in active business decisions, secular leaders are aware that sustainability relates directly to what business has called the “bottom line.” Having some form of bottom line means that management and leadership must always be responsive to the market and attentive to business infrastructure. One always has to improve, adapt, and respond, or face going out of business. While profitability is the bottom line for businesses, the church obviously does not measure its success by such a fiscal standard, but by whether or not it is fulfilling its mission—that’s its bottom line. Harder to measure, for sure, but the church that commits to improving, adapting, and responding to the surrounding culture will be more sustainable than one that pays little attention. Even though churches don’t equate sustainability with making a profit, implementing a sound plan for supporting a growing and healthy church, agency, or ministry team is an important aspect of a church’s sustainability. Normally churches assume one basic and unquestioned form of ministry support in Western contexts—that of centralized funding. A minister or leader is paid from the collected funds of the local church or agency. But allow us to question it for a moment. In this support structure, a church ministry team can only grow in direct relation to the size of the congregation—the ratio being perhaps one paid minister to seventy members depending on the relative wealth of the church community. In difficult missional contexts this is a formula for failure. Furthermore, centralized funding makes the minister or leader economically subservient to the dominant interests of the group. It’s very hard to have a prophetic ministry to the group that provides your salary. And this incapacity to cultivate an authentic prophetic ministry contributes directly to the institutionalization of ministry and the church. Leadership is thus always hostage to the reactionary groups in the congregation. Change becomes inordinately hard. It’s much better if the leaders think organically about support systems. We suggest that pioneering leaders consider di!erent ways of supporting themselves and the people they lead. We suggest here three tried-and-true methods of personal support: Bi-vocational support or tentmaking: In this model, the leader, minister, or missionary works two places at once. He or she might work in non-churchbased settings in order to support himself or herself for ministry in the direct missional setting. This has great advantages: It allows for a certain freedom to act as a leader in the church or mission agency. The group has less chance of manipulating leadership. It remains a labor of love. It keeps the Christian worker missionally honest as he or she has to interact meaningfully with non-Christians all the time. Missional support: The church easily thinks of this in relation to overseas missions but seldom for missions in Western contexts, and yet this is one of Organizing the Revolution the best ways to sustain oneself in mission over the long haul. The benefits of developing mission support systems is: The missionary has a direct, and often long-term, relationship to those who support him or her. Many of these are family and friends who are more likely to support the missionary because of the preexisting relationship. The missionary takes responsibility for his or her own support, and it becomes part of the ministry to maintain the support base. This ensures more prayer on behalf of the worker and the support group. The mission team can grow as big as needed depending on vision and capacity to recruit new members to the team. As such, this system is not only sustainable, but reproducible and organic as well. Centralized funding: We have already mentioned this as the traditional form of ministry support, and while it has some problems associated with it, it is still a viable form of support. We suggest that centralized funding can be used to support administration-type sta! while missional staffing can be bivocational or have a support team. This form of funding can come from a denominational resource or from a “mother church.” A mix of the above: Some situations could be handled by a combination of the above-mentioned options. We have seen a number of very e!ective missional agencies develop and grow in a sustainable way by adopting one or another of these ways to fund their key workers. Urban Neighbours of Hope, the mission order among the poor in Melbourne and Bangkok, has e!ectively planted many churches and has done wonderful work among the poor without a shred of centralized funding for its workers. The same is true for a group called Frontier Servants in Australia and India, and InnerCHANGE in America, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Some of our artist-missionary comrades in San Francisco and Los Angeles work similarly on mission support and tentmaking. It is the support system of the future. We suggest it is time for church planters and established churches to consider doing the same. Sustainability and organic growth are at stake. Reproduce After Your Own Kind The task of church planting and mission to the First World requires specialized training quite distinct from that of standard ministry formation pathways. The task-orientation for church planters and missionaries is di!erent from that of normal church-based ministry and therefore requires a di!erent approach. We believe that the gifting-clusters and therefore the training emphases required by missionaries and church planters in Western contexts is distinctive. If we accept that the description of ministry types and skills in Ephesians 4:11–12 (apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers) is normative for the church, it therefore provides an analytical framework to assess the provision of current training for all types. It is evident that the skills required for missional leadership development fit within the cluster of ministry skills associated with the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic giftings mentioned in this passage. Generalized ministry training, which is predominant in all denominational structures, focuses primarily on the gifting-clusters related to the pastor-teacher. Hence the predominance of biblical, theological, ethical, and counseling subjects. This does not disparage such training, because this type of ministry formation is vital to the ongoing health of established churches. However, there is a lack of emphasis on that particular ministry mix needed for the complex task of twenty-first-century church planting—a mix emphasizing the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic gifting-clusters. We believe that in addition to theological and ministry skills, the church planter or missionary in Western, postmodern, cultural environments requires the following skills: A more actional approach that directly develops distinct entrepreneurial skills; A sharpened ability to interpret and engage popular culture, as opposed to church culture;8 Capacities to implement marketing-type strategies; Skills in basic sociological research and in the interpretation of general social trends; Innovative evangelistic communication skills, including a “media awareness” and leadership and team development skills.9 The Dawn Project has stimulated successful pioneering leadership development programs, and it was with this in mind that Alan, Michael, and other missional leaders set about developing Forge Mission Training Network in Australia. We o!er here some of the basic philosophy as examples of how the strategic task of developing missional leadership is being successfully done The church mindset is di!erent from the mindset of an unchurched culture. Ministry training for revitalization work focuses on changing the church and Christian people. The church planter works with a di!erent “clientele.” The church planter does not begin with a church, a team, and a building. He or she must start from scratch. This requires di!erent abilities, which must be cultivated. Organizing the Revolution in one context. Our mission statement at Forge is simply “To help birth and nurture the missional church in Australia, New Zealand, and beyond.” We have set our core values as follows: A holistic approach to mission; An action-learning approach to missional leadership development; A cross-cultural mission methodology in all settings; A grassroots movement ethos; A diversity of approaches and models; Networked, cross-denominational structures; A passionate action-based spirituality; Creativity, innovation, and experimentation in all we do; The priority of modeling for leadership and mission. We set out to achieve the following outcomes: To stimulate mission as a strategic priority; To see growth in number of new churches and mission projects; To inculcate a missional leadership development; To provide service to, and leadership in, the Australian church; To nurture the development of the missionary identity of the church; To foster a networked and empowered body of missionaries and church planters in Australia. And we set about doing it as follows: By raising up, and shaping, a future generation of missional leaders; By focusing on developing the distinctly pioneering type of leader; By helping birth and stimulate a distinctive missionary identity in all our interns and students; By contributing to the development of a missiology appropriate to each and every distinctive context; By actively stimulating innovation and creativity in any and every way; By coordinating an energetic community/network of leaders and activists focused on the task of mission. And we believe that the following educational philosophy is of great significance to the development of e!ective missional leaders. Again we o!er it as the guiding philosophy of Forge and not as normative for all systems, but we suggest that all these have important implications for training leaders in general. Actional context is primary: We believe that one cannot learn mission divorced from the context of mission. The same applies to leadership and ministry. Therefore, the vast majority of the learning and training must take place in the organic context of the student or intern’s workplace or mission setting. Furthermore di!erent leadership styles will emerge from di!erent mission contexts. Context is everything: Interns are placed in edgy learning environments: We try to place interns in positions where they are “at risk” or out of their comfort zones and therefore most inclined to learn. We then bring the learning to them when they need it. Action-reflection learning model: We believe that action is the starting point for reflection and therefore fundamental to the learning and discipling process. Real learning cannot therefore occur without a primary actional element. Relational empowerment: We hold that relationships are the primary means of transferring leadership and influence and are, as such, indispensable in the training of missional leaders. Therefore, weekly and monthly coaching sessions form the backbone of the Forge internship process. Practitioner-teachers: We believe that teachers cannot teach what they do not personally know and cannot lead where they themselves will not go. In light of this we expose our interns only to leaders and practitioners who have a direct and current experience at a cutting edge mission, church plant, or ministry project. Inspiration, then information: We believe that people are not motivated by information alone; real motivation arises when they connect with their basic passion and calling ... they must be moved and inspired to act with passion for the kingdom of God. Our intensives, therefore, aim primarily at inspiration, not just on giving new information. Life-oriented experiential learning: We believe that the best educational theory confirms the fact that people learn best when learning matches the life experience of the learner. The idea that students are blank slates that come to be filled with knowledge is bad theology and even worse educational philosophy. Therefore we try to bring the experience and the learning moment together. Imagination as a resource for leadership: Imagination is the basis of vision and innovation and creativity. Interns and students are stimulated to think in pioneering and innovative ways of doing and being church. Organizing the Revolution Leadership development, not just skill development: As we believe that leadership is the key leverage area for change and mission, our primary focus is on developing and nurturing distinctive leadership qualities and characteristics and then on providing skills. Multi-dimensional leadership systems: We believe that the church needs to recover the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic functions to be an authentic missional church. Our training focuses primarily on developing these functions in relation to mission and leadership. What is somewhat unique about Forge is the cross-denominational, intercollegial, multiproject nature of the network. We were able to thus secure significant legitimization and accreditation for our interns while keeping them primarily in their local projects and coaching them in missional leadership formation. We don’t think Forge is the cavalry sent to rescue the church from danger. Rather, we see it as our humble attempt to generate a creative, daring, innovative new generation of leadership for the Australian church. We commend you to find the methods and forums for doing the same in your context. To conclude this section on leadership, indeed to conclude this book, we refer to a parable credited to that radical nineteenth-century disciple Søren Kierkegaard. Again the parable involves geese. Many of us, and especially those who have lived in the country, will have witnessed the migration of geese as they undertake a massive journey to follow spring and summer around the world. Characteristically, geese make a screeching sound as they fly. If one were able to observe the e!ect of this wild call on tame barnyard geese, the ones who have given up on the dangerous journey in favor of barnyard food and security, one would see that as the wild cousins fly overhead, the tame geese run along the ground and flap their wings wildly, somehow trying to imitate the mad flight of the migrating geese. The squawking seems to awaken something innate in them, a memory of wildness. We want to suggest that this story has implications for us on many levels. On one level we suggest that it is the task of leadership to do exactly the same as the wild geese: to fly over the heads of those we lead in order to call them to the dangerous journey of mission and engagement in the name of God. To do this, we ourselves have to take flight and risk the long journey across the continents. The task of leadership and, by extension, the task of developing missional leaders, requires us to call people to do wild things—to remind them what they are made for. On another level, the story reminds us that at bottom, we are disciples of Jesus Christ. The disciple, too, has to take the journey of risk. In flying over the heads of the people in our culture, our task is to call them to the dangerous but marvelously instinctive journey to God through Jesus Christ. The twist in the tale is this: that while it has been observed that wild geese have become tame ... it has seldom been observed that tame geese can become wild again. We need to beware of the anesthetizing and stultifying e!ects that Christendom, the tame, nonmissional church, and our safe middle classness have had on us. We began this book with the question “Evolution or Revolution?” We think it’s that desperate. Either the church will seek to continue to evolve (or devolve?) into increasing irrelevancy and impotency in the West or it will answer the revolutionary clarion call. We have written this text with the hope that it might give some legitimacy to the missional church as it tries to break out of its chrysalis in the Western world. As it stands now, we believe the whole missional church project is no longer a marginal thing or as precarious. But it is not exactly fully mainstream either. Much will depend on how the now well-established forms of church and Christianity respond to the whole project. Will they give permission for experimentation and space to emerge or will they seek to further marginalize the fragile new expressions of churches popping up in the strangest places? The established church is simply going to have to put up with more chaos and lack of clarity for a while. Chaos usually goes hand in hand with creativity—uniformity will stifle any new e!ort in an attempt to control the situation. Whatever, the jury is out at present. But there are positive signs of a growing consensus among strategic and denominational leadership that things are not well on the good ship Christendom—enough consensus perhaps to let the new emerge even if they contain an implied critique of the existing systems of thought and activity. Perhaps even more importantly, the birth of the missional church will de- pend on whether enough people will be found willing to respond to the critical issues of our time and have a go at dreaming up new forms of church and creating new ways of doing ministry and mission. We believe that the actual experimentation, the revolution if you will, will be actively led and executed by younger people—most revolutions are. The “people-power” revolution in the Philippines, the downfall of Suharto in Indonesia, the flower revolution of the 60s—these were all initiated and advanced by young people. Much of Organizing the Revolution our future lies in the precarious hands and hearts of a generation that finds it difficult to decide and commit. Our heartfelt prayer is that our youth will find the necessary courage to break with the enslaving power of the habitual and familiar. There are signs that this is indeed happening all over the world, and in this we rejoice. May we remember the words of Paulo Coelho, “The ship is safest when it’s in port. But that’s not what ships were made for.”10 # Apest The term we use to describe the fivefold ministry formula found in Ephesians 4. APEST is an acrostic for Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd (pastor), Teacher. Only when all five roles are operating within the leadership of a local congregation, and the congregation as a whole has embraced the five functions within its corporate life, can one say that an APEST version of leadership is occurring. We believe such a matrix is the antidote to the triangular or hierarchical model that empowers certain leaders and disempowers the majority of Christians. We use the term very specifically to describe not so much the theology of the church but the mode of the New Testament church—to describe something of its energy, impulse, and genius as well as its leadership structures. An apostolic church is one gripped by the imperatives of the New Testament church. By apostolic leadership we are not suggesting the large-church leadership model or the supra-denominational leadership model favored by many Pentecostal leaders and writers today. An approach to Christian mission in which the church develops programs, meetings, services, or other “products” in order to attract unbelievers into the influence of the Christian community. While there is an element to which the New Testament church was attractive and enjoyed the favor of the broader community (in some contexts), we believe that the contemporary church now almost totally relies on an attractional approach to its community. We employ the term to describe the current mission stance of the church, a stance that is increasingly ine!ective. Sometimes we use the term extractional to mean the same thing. Biblical-Hebraic Describes the worldview that basically formed, framed, and sustains the biblical revelation. When we use the term biblical-Hebraic we refer to the Hebraic worldview specifically found in the Scriptures. The term Hebraic on its own can encompass the insights of later Judaism as well. A bounded set is a group of objects defined by a boundary separating those in the set from those outside the set. When we use this term with reference to the traditional church, we are referring to the church’s propensity to develop laws or prescriptions for determining who is in the church and who is out. While we hold strongly to holiness as a key feature of the missional church, such holiness should be judged by the degree of Christlikeness, not by some artificial human rule. A centered set is a group of objects defined by its proximity to a central object. When we refer to the missional church as a centered set, we are saying that the church’s membership should not be defined by some artificial (and often socially prescribed) set of criteria, but by proximity to Jesus. We claim that mission should therefore be Christocentric. As we use the term, it describes the standardized form and expression of the church and mission formed in the post-Constantine period. Essentially we see the Christendom church as fundamentally di!erent from the New Testament church and from what we see as an authentic missional community. Christendom is marked by the following characteristics: Its mode of engagement is attractional as opposed to missional/sending. It assumes a certain centrality of the church in relation to its surrounding culture. (The missional church is a “going/sending one” and operates in the incarnational mode.) A shift of focus to dedicated, sacred buildings or places of worship. The association of buildings with “church” fundamentally alters the way the church perceives itself. It becomes more static and as a consequence, almost exclusively attractional. The early church had no recognized dedicated buildings other than houses and public spaces. The emergence of an institutionally recognized, professional clergy class acting primarily in a pastor-teacher type mode. In the New Testament church people were commissioned into leadership by local churches or by an apostolic leader. But this was basically di!erent from the denominational or institutional sanction or licensing we know in Christendom. This had the e!ect of creating two classes of Christians: the clergy and the laity. The idea of a separated clergy, we maintain, is as alien to a New Testament church as it is to a missional one. The paradigm is also characterized by the institutionalization of grace in the form of sacraments administered by an institutionally licensed priesthood. The New Testament church’s form of communion was the daily meal dedicated to Jesus in the context of everyday life. Christology/Christological Essentially Christology comprises the biblical teaching of and about Jesus the Messiah. When we say Christology must inform all aspects of the church’s life and work, we mean that Jesus must be first and foremost in our lives and self-definition as church and disciple. When the word is used as an adjective, it simply means that the element being described must be referenced primarily by our understanding and experience of Jesus the Messiah. This simply means that Christ is center. If something is Christocentric, then its organizing principle is the person and work of Christ. This is in e!ect a synonym for our use of the term messianic. This has implications also for our belief that the missional church will be a centered set, with Christ at the center. The initiation and development of new, organic, missional-incarnational communities of faith in multiple contexts. We would affirm that all true mission aims at the development of communities of faith. Thus church planting is an essential part of any authentic missional strategy. Since we are not constrained by the belief in the parish model of church territorialism, we believe local neighborhoods can sustain several churches, each seeking to reach di!erent strata of society. Church planting should not just be limited to new, middle-class housing communities. The Greco-Roman assumption that the world is divided into two competing realms: the sacred (spiritual) and the profane (material). Such a worldview tends to assume that the spiritual is the higher plane and the material world is devoid of meaning and is simply to be escaped by those seeking spiritual maturity. Dualism leads to other such divisions in thinking: the division between the clergy (spiritual) and the laity (profane); the church (spiritual) and the world (profane); between spirituality and sexuality; between so-called religious practices (prayer, worship) and so-called profane ones (work, art, eating). We believe such dualism undergirds virtually every tenet of the Christendom church (and therefore undermines the tenets of the missional church). Classically this refers to the biblical teaching about the nature, life, and practices of the church. We believe that our ecclesiology should emerge from our missiology, which should in turn derive from our Christology. The practice of the Christendom-era church of converting unbelievers, then extracting them from their cultural setting to join the church, thereby making them ine!ective as missionaries to their own people groups. It is a missiological term. An extractional mode of mission exacerbates the church’s disconnection from its host culture. See also attractional. The Incarnation refers to the act of God entering into the created universe and realm of human a!airs as the man Jesus of Nazareth. In relation to mission it means the followers of Jesus similarly embodying the culture and life of a host culture in order to reach that group of people with Jesus’ love. We also use the term to describe the missionary act of going to a target people group as opposed to merely making the invitation for unbelievers to come to our cultural group (the church) in order to hear the gospel. We see it as a term that describes a missional stance taken by the church. If the church is incarnational, its stance is always inclined to go forth and enter into the lives of a host community. In this sense incarnational is di!erent from attractional or extractional. Refer to Biblical-Hebraic above. Essentially, the worldview nurtured primarily by the Bible. Hebraic in the broader sense can also mean the worldview of the Jewish people as a racial group deeply influenced as it is by Judaism. A term derived from Jewish mysticism. It describes the level of intentionality built into an action. As a deliberate spiritual exercise, kavanah involves the concentration of development of intentionality prior to acting and so filling one’s actions with meaning and purpose. Our term for apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, pastoral (shepherding), and didactic (teaching) leadership as it is drawn from the ministry matrix (see below). Viewed as such, leadership is a calling within a calling. Similar to our use of the term Christocentric. We use it to describe the church’s spirituality and activity. It is messianic in that it acts in the same way Jesus acts, it is essentially structured around the person of Jesus, and our actions in some way extend the messianic kingdom. Our actions are directly redemptive and related to God’s activity in the world. This covers the entire church’s being described in terms of being apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, pastoral (shepherding), and didactic (teaching). See Ephesians 4:7 (“to each one ... has been given”) and 4:11 (“It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers”). This distribution formula describes the whole church and not just leadership as it is commonly interpreted. Leaders are drawn from the APEST (see above) nature of the church. Missiology/Missiological Missiology is the study of missions. As a discipline, it seeks to identify the primal impulses in the Scriptures that compel God’s people into engagement with the world. Such impulses involve, among others, the missio Dei (the mission of God), the Incarnation, and the kingdom of God. It also describes the authentic church’s commitment to social justice, relational righteousness, and evangelism. As such, missiology seeks to define the church’s purposes in light of God’s will for the world. It also seeks to study the methods of achieving these ends both from Scripture and history. The term missiological simply draws from these meanings. A favorite term of ours—we use it to describe the church, leadership, Christianity, and more. A missional church is one whose primary commitment is
