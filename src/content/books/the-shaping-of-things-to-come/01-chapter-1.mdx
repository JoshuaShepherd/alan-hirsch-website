---You Must Read This Bit First The first edition of The Shaping of Things to Come was published in 2003, although we had begun what turned out to be the lengthy and laborious process of writing it several years before that. It has also been subsequently translated into German and Korean, and has been read across the globe. Given this exposure, and that it was penned over a decade ago, we are regularly asked whether we still agree with what we wrote then, and if there’s anything we’d change if we could write it over. Our answer is invariably the same: we still totally stand by the central tenets of this book, but there are three changes we’d make if we were rewriting it: update the anecdotes and snapshots of missional projects outlined in the original edition; soften the polemical edge of the early section that appears to dismiss all traditional approaches as inherently non-missional; and be less pessimistic about inviting the leaders of established churches to incorporate missional principles into their churches. On the first point, the need to update our illustrations should be evident. More than ten years after our search for missional experiments took us across the US and the UK back in the early 2000s, we can now report that the missional paradigm is being widely discussed and indeed accepted by church planters around the world. There are many more fresh stories to tell, and with the help of our colleague and friend, Lance Ford, we have now included them throughout this edition. The second and third points are related. We acknowledge that we were rather too quick in dismissing existing traditional churches and their leaders from being able to re-missionalize what they were doing. Part of the reason for this is that we wrote the book primarily for church planters and missionaries in the West—a group of people who needed material that took us beyond contemporary church growth approaches to being genuine cross-cultural missionaries in our context. It was built on the curriculum we had developed for Forge Mission Training Network. There was no such text available at the time. All we had was the Church Planter’s Toolkit, a resource that was great for people in non-missional environments, but no longer worked for those of us who found ourselves isolated from mainstream Western culture. We never thought that the book would be read by established church leaders. None were more surprised than us when it became something of a defining text for the missional church movement as a whole. As a result, the tone of the first edition can be read as being somewhat dismissive (some might say, obnoxiously so) of prevailing forms of church. Consequently we do think it is appropriate to soften the stridency without underplaying the intended revolutionary invitation originally sounded by The Shaping of Things to Come. Indeed, we suspect the book garnered the readership it did partly because we were so raucous in our call to the church to embrace wholesale change. We laid all our cards on the table and called it as we saw it. Many people didn’t like that, but it did keep them reading. Maybe our original tone was shockingly appropriate back in 2003, but a decade later we think a less strident, but no less radical, call is more in keeping with our times. We are also seeing encouraging shifts within existing churches toward a greater embracing of the missional paradigm. In 2003 we confessed our belief that the planting of new, culturally diverse missional communities was the best way forward for the church, acknowledging that the challenging missional context in the West required us to adopt a fully incarnational stance, a stance we openly doubted most established churches could embrace. We had seen some churches become revitalized, but felt that such success was so rare that the greater hope lay in a missional church planting movement. Today, we certainly don’t back o! from our hope for such church planting movements to emerge, but we are rather more optimistic about missional revitalization within the established church. In fact, Alan in particular has been working with large churches across the US in the Future Travelers project, exploring principles for the adoption of a missional stance in large established churches. These principles were detailed in his book with Dave Ferguson, On the Verge (Zondervan, 2011). The signs are much more promising than we would ever have anticipated in 2003. You Must Read This Bit First 11 Nonetheless, we are hopeful that this second edition of The Shaping of Things to Come can remain the incendiary shot across the bow of the church that it was ten years ago. In our introduction to the first edition we wrote, In this book expect to encounter revolutionary ideas that will sometimes unnerve you. We hope to reawaken the latent apostolic imagination at the heart of the biblical faith and to exhort God’s people to courageous missional engagement for our time—living out the gospel within its cultural context rather than perpetuating an institutional commitment apart from its cultural context. In writing this book we are advocating a wholesale change in the way Christians are doing and being the church, and because of this ours is not necessarily a popular message. We don’t wish to soft-sell that unpopular message today and have been careful not to tamper with the rousing tone and clarion call it contains. We trust this second edition will be as combustible as was its original incarnation. # P A R T O N E THE SHAPE WE’RE IN Evolution or Revolution? There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more difficult to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all those who would profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new. —Machiavelli A Bad Day in Black Rock? Something’s up in the Nevada desert outside Reno. A movement is gathering force and it is not leaving its participants untouched. Its influence is now stretching across the US. On the playa, the four-hundred-square-mile, flat-floored basin known by artists and musicians around the world as Black Rock Desert, the annual pilgrimage to Burning Man builds to a crescendo. Burning Man is perhaps the ultimate postmodern festival. Each year thousands of artists, musicians, bohemians, punks, taggers, rappers, and other artistes or simply interested bystanders journey into the 107-degree heat of the desert for a festival like no other. It is a temporary community of people committed to generosity, environmentalism, celebration, spirituality, and above all, art. Burning Man has been so successful over the past twenty or so years that it has come to represent those trends that pose the greatest challenges to the Christian church. It dares to o!er acceptance, community, an experience of god, redemption, and atonement. In short, it resembles everything the church is supposed to o!er. But many people are finding the transformative power of Burning Man to be far and away more e!ective than anything they experience in church. Although Christians might be tempted to focus on and condemn Burning Man’s patently pagan elements—the near-deification of art, nature, and the individual, not to mention the quasi-sacred rite in which both a human effigy and “confessional cards” are burned—we should rather examine what takes place at Burning Man in order to learn why thousands of people flock to the event every year. It is actually quite easy to denigrate Burning Man as a counterfeit religious experience, but Christians who content themselves with this will never understand what exactly draws participants to live under the Man’s watchful gaze in Black Rock Desert. They will never discover what people today are searching for and thus will never o!er the authentic spiritual experience that people crave. Eager to understand this experience and the cravings behind it, Alan and his wife Debra journeyed to the desert themselves recently. Along with members of their church, The Tribe of LA, they entered fully into the Burning Man experience for its own sake, but also as a kind of exercise in anthropological research. What drew people to Burning Man? What longings were met on the floor of the Black Rock Desert? What they found confirmed what participants have previously told us. According to participants at this postmodern festival, six key elements make up the Burning Man experience. Belonging: Says the official Burning Man website, You belong here and you participate. You’re not the weirdest kid in the classroom—there’s always somebody there who’s thought up something you never even considered. You’re there to breathe art. Imagine an ice sculpture emitting glacial music—in the desert. Imagine the Man, greeting you, neon and benevolence, watching over the community. You’re here to build a community that needs you and relies on you.1 In a society that has been fractured by economic rationalism, globalization, racial disunity, ideological di!erences, fear, and violence, the Burning Man community claims to o!er solace, welcome, and acceptance. Survival: Burning Man is not for the fainthearted. It involves venturing into the desert and surviving without restaurants, air conditioning, or shopping This and all subsequent quotations about Burning Man are from Molly Steenson, “What Is Burning Man?” http://burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/ experience.html. Evolution or Revolution? 17 malls. Why is this important? With all the comforts of home stripped away, participants have no choice but to look deep within themselves, to discover who they truly are, and to summon up from within themselves the will and the power to survive—both in the desert and after they return to the world outside. Empowerment: Again, to the website: You’re here to create. Since nobody at Burning Man is a spectator, you’re here to build your own new world. You’ve built an egg for shelter, a suit made of light sticks, a car that looks like a shark’s fin. You’ve covered yourself in silver, you’re wearing a straw hat and a string of pearls, or maybe a skirt for the first time. Some artists create massive, highly sophisticated art installations. Others develop smaller works. Some people simply paint their naked bodies or their cars. Others, who have come expecting merely to spectate, are cajoled into expressing themselves creatively throughout the week. No one is deemed to be without talent. Sensuality: Burning Man is a highly sensual, experiential community. You’re here to experience. Ride your bike in the expanse of nothingness with your eyes closed. Meet the theme camp—enjoy Irrational Geographic, relax at Bianca’s Smut Shack and eat a grilled cheese sandwich. Find your love and understand each other as you walk slowly under a parasol. Wander under the veils of dust at night on the playa. Celebration: The crescendo of the festival is the burning of the large human effigy in the middle of the camp. Participants have told us that as the Burning Man goes up in flames, they experience a deeply spiritual sensation. As the founder of Burning Man, Larry Harvey says, As the procession starts, the circle forms, and the man ignites, you experience something personal, something new to yourself, something you’ve never felt before. It’s an epiphany, it’s primal, it’s newborn. And it’s completely individual. Artists cast their art works into the flames. There is apparently a purging, a form of atonement, and a sense of liberation and joy. Liminality: The word liminal from the Latin limen (threshold) signifies an inbetween time. Often used by anthropologists to describe the period between childhood and adulthood, it refers to the transitional, temporary period of human transformation. The Burning Man community appears in August and takes over the seemingly untouched playa, then leaves in September, removing any trace that it was ever there. First-timers are instructed, You’ll leave as you came. When you depart from Burning Man, you leave no trace. Everything you built, you dismantle. The waste you make and the objects you consume leave with you. Volunteers will stay for weeks to return the Black Rock Desert to its pristine condition. But you’ll take the world you built with you. When you drive back down the dusty roads toward home, you slowly reintegrate to the world you came from. You feel in tune with the other dust-covered vehicles that shared the same community. Over time, vivid images still dance in your brain, floating back to you when the weather changes. The Burning Man community, whether your friends, your new acquaintances, or the Burning Man project, embraces you. At the end, though your journeys to and from Burning Man are finished, you embark on a di!erent journey—forever. We open this book with our impressions of the Burning Man phenomenon because it and festivals like it around the world seem to be saying something important to the world in general and to the church specifically. Burning Man is not just a bad day in Black Rock (to quote a great movie title). It’s a cry from an emerging postmodern generation for a community of belonging, spirituality, sensuality, empowerment, and liberation. And yet, once you’ve been to the Nevada desert and tasted something as overwhelming as Burning Man, what does the contemporary traditional church have to o!er you? We, the authors, take the view that the transformative power of the gospel of Jesus Christ is greater than anything o!ered at Black Rock. But we are realistic enough to admit that unless the church recovers its role as a subversive, missionary movement, no one who has been to Burning Man will be the least bit interested in it. We are both missionaries to the core. And like all missionaries we cannot stand by and watch the contemporary church become a pale, anemic version of its former self. What is required to reach the Burning Man generation is nothing less than a complete paradigm shift for the Western church. The same people who first told us about Burning Man also spoke with gusto about their favorite film, Fight Club, starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. In that film a subversive community of young men begins to gather around the charismatic figure Tyler Durden (played by both Pitt and Norton—if you haven’t seen the film, don’t ask). Under his manic leadership the club members meet to fight each other and to inflict random acts of seditious violence on society. Theirs is a community of male empowerment with a strongly anticonsumerist sentiment. Like the Burning Man festival, it is also about belonging, liberation, rebellion, and the rejection of middle-class American values. There is Evolution or Revolution? 19 an untamed energy about Durden’s fight club. It has a dissident wildness about it, and we know many young men who have been deeply a!ected by the film. It might seem unsavory to many Christian people to be asked to learn something about the need for an emerging missional church by exploring Burning Man or Fight Club. But we are convinced that both are prime examples of the desperate yearning that has been unleashed in the Western world over the past few decades. During that time, the advent of postmodernism has raised within the West many expectations for an experiential, activist form of religious, mystical experience. The Christian church has not met these expectations, though it could be argued that for a brief time some forms of Pentecostalism came closer than the rest of the church. The contemporary traditional church is increasingly seen as the least likely option for those seeking an artistic, politically subversive, activist community of mystical faith. The church can no longer write the emerging Burning Man generation o! as a small subculture. While the activities at Burning Man might not be everybody’s cup of tea, the yearnings it seeks to meet are much more common than the church gives credence to. D. H. Lawrence said as long ago as 1924, “The adventure has gone out of the Christian venture.” He then proposed that humankind create a new venture toward hope. His aspirations are still being played out to this day. Evolution or Revolution? We’ve become increasingly convinced that what the church needs to find its way out of the situation it’s in at the beginning of the twenty-first century is not more faddish theories about how to grow the church without fundamentally reforming its structures. What the church needs is a revolutionary new approach. Therefore, it is our intention to tell stories about the local heroes we’ve encountered on our travels around the world. Because we do not advocate a one-size-fits-all approach to church planting and church growth, the various models we’ll discuss are presented not as a panacea, not as the recommended way forward for the church, but as examples of what certain missionaries have done in their quests to reach Melbourne, San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Glasgow, and many other cities in the Western context with the gospel. We will present a number of principles and suggestions for church leaders wanting to morph into what is now openly being called the missional church. The Gospel and Our Culture Network (GOCN) says, “The missional church represents God in the encounter between God and human culture. It exists not because of human goals or desires, but as a result of God’s creating and saving work in the world. It is a visible manifestation of how the Good News of Jesus Christ is present in human life and transforms human culture to reflect more faithfully God’s intentions for creation. It is a community that visibly and e!ectively participates in God’s activity, just as Jesus indicated when he referred to it in metaphorical language as salt, yeast, and light in the world.”2 In case this sounds like the mandate for just about every church (whether consciously “missional” or not), GOCN furthers its definition by stating that a missional church “seeks to discern God’s specific missional vocation for the entire community and for all of its members.” In other words, such a church makes its mission its priority and perpetually asks itself, “What has God called us to be and do in our current cultural context?” The issue of cultural context is essential because the missional church shapes itself to fit that context in order to transform it for the sake of the kingdom of God. By definition, the missional church is always outward looking, always changing (as culture continues to change), and always faithful to the Word of God. In many places it is so radical it barely resembles church as we know it. In other cases it might appear conventional but is in fact incarnating itself into its community in surprising and exciting ways. Above all, we’re convinced that what will ultimately be required is Christian leadership that values imagination, creativity, innovation, and daring. Albert Einstein, one of history’s greatest thinkers, once noted that “the kind of thinking that will solve the world’s problems will be of a di!erent order to the kind of thinking that created those problems in the first place.” This was no mere wordplay for Einstein. It was the defining motif in his life as a paradigm shifter. His ability to think with radical originality precipitated no less than two, and some argue three, major paradigm shifts in our understanding of physics and of the cosmos, and in so doing changed the course of history and shaped the thinking of generations. We are proposing that a similar paradigm-busting imagination is needed for the emergence of the missional church of the twenty-first century in the West. If Einstein was right, then the problems of the church, like all real problems in any context, cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created those problems in the first instance. In other words, boxlike thinking simply cannot resolve the problems created by the box itself. We are in dire need of some Einsteinian originality if we are going to engage the issues of the twenty-first century with any real missional e!ectiveness. It’s time to step out of the box of Christendom in order to take on the problems raised by Christendom. See http://www.gocn.org/. Evolution or Revolution? 21 Christendom—Get Over It! Christendom is the name given to the sacral culture that has dominated European society from around the eleventh century until the end of the twentieth. Its sources go back to the time when Constantine came to the throne of the Roman Empire and granted Christians complete freedom of worship and even favored Christianity, thereby undermining all other religions in the empire.3 In virtually an instant, Christianity moved from being a marginalized, subversive, and persecuted movement secretly gathering in houses and catacombs to being the favored religion in the empire. Everything changed! The emperor had changed from being the principal persecutor of Christianity to being the chief sponsor of the church. With the Edict of Milan, the age of the missional-apostolic church had come to an end. Things were to be very di!erent from then on. In the fifth to tenth centuries Christianity grew from infancy to adulthood throughout Western Europe, emerging in the eleventh century as fully grown and in control of the culture. By the Middle Ages, the church-state symbiosis was formalized into an institutional interdependence between the pope and the ruler of what was then called the Holy Roman Empire, e!ectively Western Europe today. This institutional partnership between church and state changed forever the social behaviors and religious patterning of Europe. In the corpus Christianum (viz. Christendom), church and state became the pillars of the sacral culture, each supporting the other. Even where there existed conflicts between church and state, it was always a conflict within the overarching configuration of Christendom itself. Christendom had by this stage developed its own distinct identity, one that provided the matrix for the understanding of both church and state. It had e!ectively become the metanarrative for an entire epoch. A metanarrative is an overarching story that claims to contain truth applicable to all people at all times in all cultures. And while the Christendom story no longer defines Western culture, it still remains the primary definer of the church’s self-understanding in almost every Western nation, including and perhaps especially the United States. That metanarrative not only defined church and state, it defined all the individuals and social structures in its orbit of influence. Members of that society were assumed to be Christian by birth rather than by choice. Christianity was When we proclaim Christendom dead, we use that term—Christendom—advisedly. We don’t proclaim Christianity dead, nor the church. Jesus promised that he would build his church and the gates of hell would not prevail against it. But Christendom, that period of Western history during which the church held sway as the moral and spiritual centerpiece of civilization, has e!ectively vanished. an official part of the established culture of Europe. In some countries, the king or queen actually became the head of the church. Overall, Christianity moved from being a dynamic, revolutionary, social, and spiritual movement to being a religious institution with its attendant structures, priesthood, and sacraments. Taken as a sociopolitical reality, Christendom has been in decline for the last 250 years, so much so that contemporary Western culture has been called by many historians (secular and Christian) as the post-Christendom culture. Society, at least in its overtly non-Christian manifestation, is “over” Christendom. But this is not the case within the Western church itself. Christendom, as a paradigm of understanding, as a metanarrative, still exercises an overweening influence on our existing theological, missiological, and ecclesiological understandings in church circles. In other words, we still think of the church and its mission in terms of Christendom. While in reality we are in a post-Christendom context, the Western church still operates for the most part in a Christendom mode. Constantine, it seems, is still the emperor of our imaginations.

Evolution or Revolution? 23 A Tale of Two Pubs To understand the di!erence between Christendom-like thinking and the missional model, the following examples might help. Recently it was reported that a congregation in a small rural town in Australia had taken an innovative step toward reaching its community. A Melbourne newspaper announced, “Patrons of the Hamilton Hotel will soon be o!ered spirit of a di!erent kind. In an unusual conversion, the town’s Baptist congregation—who are teetotalers—have taken over one of the six pubs.”4 The Hamilton community watched in amazement as the pub, located on the main street opposite the local post office, was bought by the Baptists and renovated into a church and conference center. Its front bar was turned into a recreation area for young people and its dance area was rebuilt into a chapel and meeting room. The bar was transformed into a co!ee bar, the old pub now becoming an alcoholfree building. In the article, various church leaders from Melbourne and the pastor of the Hamilton Baptist Church spoke of the relocation as innovative, creative, and daring. However, one sour note was sounded. Midway through the newspaper article a local from Hamilton is quoted. “One of the hotel’s former regulars, farmer Bruce McKellar, 71, said he would miss his corner of the bar. ‘I would walk in and straight to it; we all had our own space,’ he said.” The implied sadness of this comment wasn’t lost on us. Farmer McKellar had been displaced from his personal seat at the bar, and though he had probably moved on to one of the other pubs, he would never again be welcomed at his favorite watering hole. In Australia, like England, the local pub is a place of acceptance and friendship. Patrons develop allegiances to their pubs and though they might visit another one occasionally, they feel a deep connection to their local (as it’s called). Though American bars can be less friendly, more foreboding places, the myth perpetuated in the successful television show Cheers, about a place “where everybody knows your name,” is true of most English and Australian pubs. In Hamilton, farmers, tradesmen, and business people had been shooed out of the Hamilton Hotel to make way for the Baptists. This project, though appearing innovative, in fact reflects Christendom thinking. It assumes that the church belongs prominently on the main street, and it claims that the church has the right to take over a public space and clean out the local people while creating a so-called sanctified religious zone. Whether it’s in a pub, a school auditorium, or a two-hundred-year-old cathedral, it ADD TITLE, Sunday Herald Sun, Melbourne, Australia, 15 October 2000, 3. represents the same thinking. As we will seek to demonstrate, what is needed is the abandonment of the strict lines of demarcation between the sacred and profane spaces in our world and the recognition that people today are searching for relational communities that o!er belonging, empowerment, and redemption. On the other side of the planet, in the English town of Bradford, another pub has been transformed by Christians. The Cock & Bottle is a yellow, two-story English pub at the bottom of the street on the corner of Bradford’s inner ring road. Two years ago it was rented by the Bradford Christian Pub Consortium. Bradford is a hardscrabble, working-class town. It has been noted in recent times for its racial conflict and street violence. But the Cock & Bottle represents a place of sanctuary and solace. Malcolm Willis has been employed by the consortium to manage the pub, and he and his wife live upstairs above the bar. He proves himself to be a genuinely missional leader when he says, “Jesus said go into all the world. And this includes pubs. He didn’t say sit in your church and wait for people to come to you.”5 The Willises and their sta! (all Christians) have set about creating a loving, welcoming environment, where locals are cared for, listened to, and ministered to. Says Willis, “Initially, many won’t accept you talking about Jesus. Maybe after you’ve listened to them ten or twenty times—which can be exhausting—they might say ‘Can you pray for me?’ And then you see things happen.”6 The missional church always thinks of the long haul rather than the quick fix. Of course, the dilemma about whether Christians should be serving alcohol or not is bound to arise. Willis is himself a teetotaler, but he has an earthy and realistic outlook on the issue of drinking, “Yes, we’re selling booze to people who could do without it, but if we don’t, they’ll just go somewhere else—at least if they’re here, we can get alongside them. I knew that when I came here I personally had to be seen not to drink, but I’m not everybody. Someone once showed me Proverbs 31, which says, ‘Beer and wine are only for the dying or for those who have lost all hope. Let them drink and forget how poor and miserable they feel. But you must defend those who are helpless and have no hope.’ So I have to ask, What would Jesus have done? I think the Lord would have been here in the pubs.”7 There is a world of di!erence (and not just geographically) between the Cock & Bottle and the Hamilton Hotel. The former is missional, incarnational, and very risky. The latter is safe. It demonstrates sound financial management (it was cheaper for the Baptist Church to renovate the pub than to build a brand-new building). But it is classic Christendom thinking. GOCN, to whom we referred earlier, has fostered much research into cultural trends and the revisioning of a new (missional) approach to church. They have come up with twelve hallmarks of a missional church: The missional church proclaims the gospel. The missional church is a community where all members are involved in learning to become disciples of Jesus. The Bible is normative in this church’s life. The church understands itself as di!erent from the world because of its participation in the life, death, and resurrection of its Lord. The church seeks to discern God’s specific missional vocation for the entire community and for all of its members. A missional community is indicated by how Christians behave toward one another. It is a community that practices reconciliation. People within the community hold themselves accountable to one another in love. The church practices hospitality. Worship is the central act by which the community celebrates with joy and thanksgiving both God’s presence and God’s promised future. This community has a vital public witness. There is a recognition that the church itself is an incomplete expression of the reign of God. We can’t fault any of these features, but we would like to propose three more, overarching principles that give energy and direction to the above-mentioned marks. In fact, we will use these three features as the headings for three of the broad sections of this book. These three principles are: The missional church is incarnational, not attractional, in its ecclesiology. By incarnational we mean it does not create sanctified spaces into which unbelievers must come to encounter the gospel. Rather, the missional church disassembles itself and seeps into the cracks and crevices of a society in order to be Christ to those who don’t yet know him. The missional church is messianic, not dualistic, in its spirituality. That is, it adopts the worldview and practices of Jesus the Messiah, rather than that of the Greco-Roman empire. Instead of seeing the world as divided between the sacred (religious) and profane (nonreligious), like Christ it sees the world and God’s place in it as more holistic and integrated. The missional church adopts an apostolic, rather than a one-dimensional top-down, mode of leadership. By apostolic we mean a mode of leadership that recognizes the fivefold model detailed by Paul in Ephesians It abandons the triangular hierarchies of the traditional church and embraces a biblical, flatter leadership community that unleashes the gifts of evangelism, apostleship, and prophecy, as well as the currently popular pastoral and teaching gifts. We believe the missional genius of the church can only be unleashed when there are foundational changes made to the church’s very DNA, and this means addressing core issues like ecclesiology, spirituality, and leadership. It means a complete shift away from Christendom thinking, which is attractional, dualistic, and hierarchical. Many Christians seem to have great difficulty giving up on the old Christendom-based assumptions. They fear that to finally abandon Christendom means we cast the church into oblivion or chaos. They would ask, How could a bunch of Christians running a pub in Bradford be a church? Well, we think they can be. Many of the ways the missional church is emerging around the world look messy, chaotic, and dynamic. They don’t always meet in the same room on a Sunday for church services, but they are worshipping God, building Christian community, and serving their world. They meet the biblical criteria for a church, but they don’t often look like church as we are used to thinking of it. A helpful way of looking at the post-Christendom church is to see not disorder but a diaspora. This is the view of theologian Douglas John Hall who prefers to think of the contemporary church as a diaspora rather than as an institution. He sees this as a more positive reformulation than the resignation or defeatism of seeing Christendom’s end as chaotic. He says: If we once have the courage to give up our defense of the old facades which have nothing or very little behind them; if we cease to maintain, in public, the pretense of a universal Christendom; if we stop straining every nerve to get everybody baptized, to get everybody married in church and onto our registers (even when success means only, at bottom, a victory for tradition, custom and ancestry, not for true faith and interior conviction); if, by letting go, we visibly relieve Christianity of the burdensome impression that it accepts responsibility for everything that goes on under this Christian topdressing, the impression that Evolution or Revolution? 27 Christianity is a sort of Everyman’s Religious Varnish, a folk-religion (at the same level as that of folk-costumes)—then we can be free for real missionary adventure and apostolic self-confidence.8 Touché! We couldn’t have said it better! So then, what are the e!ects that Christendom has had on our understanding of the church and its mission, and why is it so important to “get over it”?9 Christendom in its essence is a certain stance in relation to its context, a mode of engagement, and a way of thinking about the church. Given its privileged status at the center of culture, its view of mission is fundamentally distorted. What’s more, it has a very fixed, very concrete, notion of the church—one normally associated with (distinctly designed) buildings, liturgies, denominational templates, and clergy. Its missional mode is primarily attractional/extractional rather than sending or incarnational. It assumes a certain centrality as the official religion of the culture, and its placement of buildings (usually the tallest building in the medieval setting) symbolizes that centrality. Its type of leadership can generally be described as priestly, sometimes prophetic to insiders but almost never to outsiders (no one “out there” is listening), and rarely apostolic. Christendom has moved Christianity into a maintenance mode. Christendom, when viewed from a missiological perspective, is more than the symbiotic relationship between church and state that resulted in a move away from the normative apostolic-missionary mode of the New Testament. When Christianity was recognized and accepted in 313 and then gained favored status with the imperial courts, it altered the fundamental mode of the church’s self-understanding and its conception of its unique task in the world. Because a type of “contract” now existed between the church and the political powers, the church’s understanding of itself in relation to that state, culture, and society was profoundly changed. We don’t mean to discount the incredible mission movements that occurred sporadically in the fifth to the tenth centuries. But it is fair to say that by the triumph of Christendom in the eleventh century, mission was no longer seen as necessary within Europe. It was delimited to identifiable non-Christian religions both inside and outside of the realm, but no longer to those baptized by the official church. Theology was now used as a powerful political tool. So too were missions. Mission was used as a means of colonization and advancement of various state interests. Douglas John Hall, “Metamorphosis: From Christendom to Diaspora,” in Craig Van Gelder, ed., Confident Witness (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999), 67. The e!ects of Christendom on our theological perspective in general are outside of the focus of this book. In this discussion, we will focus primarily (and briefly) on the e!ects on our notion of the church and of our understanding of its mission. Christendom set up a certain correlation, a complex of assumptions, about the association between the realms of politics, geography, church, spirituality, and mission. As a result the gospel was politicized, regionalized, as well as racial-ized. There was no longer any real place for the subversive activity associated with the New Testament gospel. The “revolution” was quelled from the inside. The historical institution of the church from then on would brook little prophetic criticism of the political realm that threatened the church’s elite status in the empire and vice versa. The Bankruptcy of Christendom The fact that the Christendom paradigm has presided over the last seventeen centuries in the West provides us with a substantial basis with which to test its success or failure. As we stand here at the roots of the 21st Century, we believe that we must, at long last, give up trying to rejig the paradigm to suit the massively changed missional contexts of the Western church. It simply has not worked. In fact, in the increasingly complex situations we now find ourselves, it has likely created more problems than it has solved. The church is in decline in almost every context in the First World. In this situation, naïve applications of traditionalist paradigms create problems ... they don’t resolve them.10 For those holding on to the Christendom mode, it is as if they were trying to interpret the cosmos with a pre-Copernican view of the world. The paradigm doesn’t fit. The emperor has been shown to have no clothes. It’s now a matter of record that one of the reasons for the loss of influence exercised by the church in the West has been its flirtation with modernity and the ideas of the Enlightenment. Says John Drane, “No persecutor or foe in two thousand years has wreaked such havoc on the church as has modernity.”11 By the end of the era of modernity in the mid-twentieth century, the Christian faith was no longer the center of Western culture. It had been swept away by the very movement it had sought to befriend. Where once the church in Europe occupied a place of significant influence, by the end of the twentieth century it was almost completely irrelevant. In Europe, the United Kingdom, and its colonial outposts, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the church had been displaced from its central position. For an excellent exploration of how simply applying solutions formulated in a di!erent era creates more problems than it solves, see Joshua Cooper Ramo, (New York: Little, Brown & Co., 2010). See also the introduction of Alan Hirsch and Dave Ferguson, (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2011). Evolution or Revolution? 29 Martin Robinson cites the Swedish church as an example.12 He notes that even though a law that prohibited Swedish citizens leaving the Church of Sweden was lifted in 1860, very few actually do. In fact, a huge 95 percent of the population are members of the national church. However, a recent study found that only 8 percent of all Swedes adhere to a Christian worldview. When you consider that that figure would undoubtedly comprise a good number of the 5 percent who have opted to join another church, there are very few official members of the Church of Sweden who hold to its tenets. The national church exists in name only. It is an artifice. The same can be said of other Western European nations. We must admit that Christendom, particularly its ecclesiological and its missiological manifestations, amounts to something of a failed experiment. To reiterate, by the term Christendom, we are referring to a period in history when the church assumed influence by its connection to temporal, secular power. Its high watermark occurred in the Middle Ages and continued beyond the Reformation well into the 1700s. Since the emergence of the Enlightenment it has been in decline, disappearing in the latter part of the twentieth century. It is time to move on and find a new mode of understanding and engagement with surrounding contexts. We can no longer a!ord our historical sentimentality, even addiction, to the past. Christendom is not the biblical mode of the church. It was/is merely one way in which the church has conceived of itself. In enshrining it as the sole form of the church, we have made it into an idol that has captivated our imaginations and enslaved us to a historical-cultural expression of the church. We have not answered the challenges of our time precisely because we refuse to let go of the idol. This must change! The answer to the problem of mission in the West requires something far more radical than reworking a dated and untenable model. It will require that we adopt something that looks far more like the early church in terms of its conception of the church (ecclesiology) and its core task in the world (missiology). The Rise of the Missional Church When there are megashifts in a culture, there tends to be a reconceptualization of the church. The more profound the cultural shift, the more thorough is the shift in the church’s notion of itself. The most noteworthy example of this was the innate connection between the Renaissance of the fifteenth century and the Reformation of the early sixteenth century. The Renaissance, particularly with its new hermeneutics, set in motion cultural forces that led inexorably to Luther’s revolution, which in turn unleashed a massive recalibration in both church theology and praxis. The church is inseparably related to its cultural milieu. This provides a vital lesson for our day. We are living in an epochshifting period in the West (and globally) as we shift from the modern to the postmodern. There is every indication that this cultural shift will be even more profound and radical than was the shift precipitated by the Renaissance, which took place within the auspices of Christendom. What is happening now is entirely outside of any discernible Christian influence. We propose that what will emerge from the chaos of the current socialhistorical shift to the postmodern is likely to be a second reformation as the church rediscovers itself as an apostolic movement. In fact, we suggest that if the church in the West does not embrace such a radical recalibration, it will find itself increasingly imperiled. The standard Christendom model will simply not engage the new generations.13 To reach them and all other innumerable subcultures, the church should abandon its role as a static institution and embrace its initial calling to be a missionary movement. What is the nature of this apostolic movement? Whereas Christendom has unraveled because of its captivity to Western culture, the missional church must see itself as being able to interact meaningfully with culture without ever being beguiled by it. This is the classic task of the cross-cultural missionary: to engage culture without compromising the gospel. We cannot emphasize this enough. In fact, the whole tenor of this book will be to call post-Christendom to see itself again as a missionary movement rather than as an institution. Essentially the early church was a missional movement to its core. It under- stood that personal conversion implied the embracing of the missio Dei—the redemptive mission of God to the whole world through the work of his Messiah. It is in this sense that we use the word apostolic, and it is this redemptive mission that we seek to recover for our own day. Forging apostolic movements will require massive paradigm shifts in the Christendom-based church. It requires a di!erent kind of thinking that innovates new modes of doing and being church and recasts its notions of leadership, structure, and mission. The church by its very nature has an indissoluble relationship to the surrounding cultural context. This relationship defines the practical nature of its mission. But the reason for mission comes from somewhere else. To say it more theologically, Christology determines missiology, and missiology determines ecclesiology which in turn returns back to Christology in a continuous cycle of See the latest research by Dave Kinnaman of the Barna Research Group, (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2011). Evolution or Revolution? 31 renewal. It is absolutely vital that the church gets the order right. We will deal with the christological issue in a later chapter and then present the practical implications in another chapter. It is Christ who determines our purpose and mission in the world (discipleship), and then it is our mission that must drive our search for modes of being-in-the-world. We began with the question “Evolution or Revolution?” Actually, while some forms of evolutionary development are necessary, the real answer is revolution. The church that Jesus intended was clearly meant to be a permanent revolution and not a codified civil religion, mere chaplains to the prevailing empire. As we will point out in the next chapter, we feel that we are living in an incredibly urgent time that can be described as the greatest spiritual awakening in the history of Western culture, and the message of the church is not even getting any airplay. We cannot expect to impact Western culture by simply renovating disused pubs. A completely alternate model is required. If we fail at this point, history will judge us very harshly. It is likely, in our home of Australia at least, that it will spell the church’s demise as a significant spiritual force in our land, and the church will be consigned to being a footnote to history. The statistics bear this out right across the West. This is not a time for evolutionary approaches alone, as if another desperate reworking of the old model is going to fix our problems and start a revival. It is time for a revolution in the way we do and are church. It is necessary for the Church to rethink its stance entirely and to become a missionary church within the West. —Martin Robinson Hope of Post-Christendom A missional church is the hope of the post-Christendom era. Many of the new Protestant church movements of recent years are simply variations on the old Christendom mode. Whether they place their emphasis on new worship styles, expressions of the Holy Spirit’s power, evangelism to seekers, or Bible teaching, these so-called new movements still operate out of the fallacious assumption that the church belongs firmly in the town square, that is, at the heart of Western culture. And if they begin with this mistaken belief about their position in Western society, all their church planting, all their reproduction will simply mirror this misapprehension. When we reflect on the 1990s, the declared Decade of Evangelism, we are given cause for deep concern. For all the flurry of activity across the West, in particular in the US and the UK, church numbers have continued to decline. When once it was assumed that church planting was the strategy for reaching a postmodern West, churchgrowth experts are now having second thoughts. Church membership has been flagging, and as the Decade of Evangelism proceeded, fewer and fewer churches were being planted. Stuart Murray and Anne Wilkinson-Hayes, in their booklet Hope from the Margins, identify a number of reasons why the church-planting boom has gone bust. Most churches which were able to plant another church early in the 1990s have not yet recovered sufficiently to do so again; Few newly-planted churches have yet grown quickly enough to plant another church; The dominance of personnel-intensive models of church planting have discouraged smaller churches from becoming involved; A disturbing number of church plants have failed, have remained small and weak, or have attracted only those who were already Christians; Church planting has generally been restricted to areas where churches are already flourishing, leaving many urban and rural areas untouched.1 The heart of the problem is that we have been planting churches that are (smaller) carbon copies of the already beleaguered, failing Christendomstyle church. The Christendom virus is passed on. It’s like Dr. Evil, in Mike Myers’s ridiculous Austin Powers movies, creating a clone called Mini-Me. By duplicating a failing system, we are digging the same hole deeper in our attempt to dig somewhere else. In fact, it’s more often than not been the case that Sunday services are planted rather than missional Jesus communities. A missional church on the other hand has abandoned the old Christendom assumptions and understands its role as an underground movement, subversive, celebratory, passionate, and communal. Mission is not merely an activity of the church. It is the very heartbeat and work of God. It is in the very being of God that the basis for the missionary enterprise is found. God is a sending God, with a desire to see humankind and creation reconciled, redeemed, and healed. The missional church, then, is a sent church. It is a going church, a movement of God through his people, sent to bring healing to a broken world. North America is as much a mission field as any other nation or people group on the face of the earth. The existing church, which is invariably static, rooted in one place, institutionalized, needs to recover its sent-ness in order to become the missional church. The overly reproduced Christendom-mode church has at its core a number of fundamental flaws. These flaws occur in the model’s very DNA. The way forward is not to tinker with its external features, but to rebirth a new movement on di!erent ground. Those flaws can be generally categorized into three The Missional Church 35 broad areas. Although we will introduce them here, we will deal with them fully throughout various sections of this book. Attractional, Dualistic, Hierarchical As mentioned, the Christendom-mode church has these three flaws in its DNA—it is attractional, dualistic, and hierarchical. First, by attractional, we mean that the traditional church plants itself within a particular community, neighborhood, or locale and expects that people will come to it to meet God and find fellowship with others. We don’t claim that there’s anything unbiblical about being attractive to unbelievers. The early church was attractive to the wider community (Acts 2:47), though there is much more evidence that the church was reviled and avoided in its early days. Nonetheless, when we say it is a flaw for the church to be attractional, we refer more to the missionary stance the church takes toward the broader host communities and cultures it inhabits. By anticipating that if they get their internal features right, people will flock to the services, the church betrays its belief in attractionalism. It’s like the Kevin Costner character in the film Field of Dreams being told by a disembodied voice, “If you build it, they will come.” Viewed in this light, we can best call this approach “extractional” or perhaps even “excarnational.” How much of the traditional church’s energy goes into adjusting their programs and their public meetings to cater to an unseen constituency? If we get our seating, our parking, our children’s program, our preaching, and our music right, they will come. This assumes that we have a place in our society and that people don’t join our churches because, though they want to be Christians, they’re unhappy with the product. The missional church recognizes that it does not hold a place of honor in its host community and that its missional imperative compels it to move out from itself into that host community as salt and light. When we have consulted with churches that recognize the need to embrace a missionary stance in their communities, we are amazed at the number of times, when asked to discuss specific ways they can recalibrate themselves to become missional churches, they begin talking about how to change their Sunday service. It betrays their fundamental allegiance to being attractional. We believe the development of indigenous, contextualized worship occurs in partnership with new believers from one’s host community. The tailoring of worship services is a lot further down the priority list for missional church leaders. The Come-To-Us stance developed over the Christendom period is unbiblical. It’s not found in the Gospels or the Epistles. Jesus, Paul, the disciples, the early church leaders all had a Go-To-Them mentality. Second, the Christendom-mode church is dualistic. It separates the sacred from the profane, the holy from the unholy, the in from the out. What we have said so far about the sickness of attractionalism finds its roots in the church’s dualistic spirituality. We will apply this more fully to the missional church model in the third section of this book. But in brief, we are convinced that the church has so fully embraced its attractional stance because of its dualistic spirituality. We talk routinely about the “world out there.” What else can that mean other than that we, the church people, are “in here”! This dualism has over 1,700 years created Christians that cannot relate their interior faith to their exterior practice, and this a!ects their ethics, their lifestyles, and their capacity to share their faith meaningfully with others. In Robert Banks’s groundbreaking book, Redeeming the Routines, he identifies the enormous gap between belief and everyday life. He points out that this gap shows up in ten worrying ways: Few of us apply or know how to apply our belief to our work, or lack of work. We only make minimal connections between our faith and our spare time activities. We have little sense of a Christian approach to regular activities like domestic chores. Our everyday attitudes are partly shaped by the dominant values of our society. Many of our spiritual difficulties stem from the daily pressure we experience (lack of time, exhaustion, family pressures, etc.). Our everyday concerns receive little attention in the church. Only occasionally do professional theologians address routine activities. When addressed, everyday issues tend to be approached too theoretically. Only a minority of Christians read religious books or attend theological courses. Most churchgoers reject the idea of a gap between their beliefs and their ways of life.2 Banks quotes occasionally from an old book called Christianity and Real Life, written by William Diehl, the sales manager of a major overseas steel corporation. Diehl, as a layman (terrible word, but you understand The Missional Church 37 its meaning), writes about the gap between the secular and the sacred in church circles: In the almost thirty years of my professional career, my church has never once suggested that there be any type of accounting of my on-the-job ministry to others. My church has never once o!ered to improve those skills which could make me a better minister, nor has it ever asked if I needed any kind of support in what I was doing. There has never been an inquiry into the types of ethical decisions I must face, or whether I seek to communicate the faith to my coworkers. I have never been in a congregation where there was any type of public affirmation of a ministry in my career. In short, I must conclude that my church really doesn’t have the least interest whether or how I minister in my daily work.3 This credibility gap between the church world and the real world is, as theologian Helmut Thielicke calls it, a modern form of Docetism.4 We believe that it is so endemic in the contemporary church that it has worked its way into the very fabric of all aspects of church life. Remove this Docetism, or dualism, from church and a great deal of what the church has built and developed over 1,700 years will fall away. Because the missional church, by its very nature, exists organically within its host community, it has had to abandon Western Christianity’s dualistic worldview in favor of a whole-of-life spirituality. Third, the traditional church (Christendom) is hierarchical, deeply indebted to what we see as an overly religious, bureaucratic, top-down model of leadership, as opposed to one that is more structured around grassroots agendas. While some denominations are ideologically committed to a very top-down hierarchical model that includes archbishops, bishops, priests, and parish councils, others (who call themselves low church) are equally indebted to top-down approaches via regional superintendents, senior pastors, associate pastors, youth pastors, and deacons. From Pentecostals to the Orthodox Church, from Baptists to Episcopalians and Presbyterians, the hierarchical model seems to be universal. For how much longer can the church ignore William Diehl, (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1976), v–vi, quoted in Banks, , 59. “Docetism is in essence a Christology heavily influenced by basic Greek assumptions of both the Platonic and Aristotelian varieties. Plato taught the idea of gradations of reality. Spirit or mind or thought is the highest. Matter or the material is less real. With this distinction of ontological gradations of reality, there came to be ethical gradations as well. Thus, matter came to be thought of as morally bad. Aristotle emphasized the idea of divine impassability, according to which God cannot change, su!er, or even be a!ected by anything that happens in the world. These two streams of thought have significant di!erences, but both maintain that the visible, physical, material world is somehow inherently evil. Both emphasize God’s transcendence and absolute di!erence from and independence of the material world.” Millard J. Erickson, (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1985), 713. Paul’s radical dissolution of the traditional distinctions between priests and laity, between officials and ordinary members, between holy men and common people? Says English pastor Rob Warner: The first Christians radically reshaped the language of “priesthood” and “sacrifice.” In one sense all are priests; believers are their own priests for all have immediacy of access to God’s grace in Christ. What priests have performed for others before, believers can now do for themselves. In another sense, none can be appointed priests in the Christian church, for Christ has fulfilled the priestly role once for all.5 Some younger leaders are discovering that in the emerging global cultural context the hierarchical model has little to say to a generation that values egalitarianism and community. Dan Mayhew, who works with Summit Fellowships in Portland, Oregon, has come to understand that to minister to an emerging generation of young people with authenticity, he has had to completely flatten his organization’s leadership style. He says, “I make a distinction between hierarchy and ‘heir-archy.’ We are to be fellow heirs with one another. It’s a bit of a play on words, but I think it conveys something very real. We are used to the systematic approach to things,
