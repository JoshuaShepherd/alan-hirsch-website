# Chapter 6: Missional Catalysis

## Thinking Differently about the Church and Her Mission

We want to be driven by a purpose that has been tailored just right for our own individual lives ... when we should be seeing the purpose of all life, including our own, wrapped up in the great mission of God for the whole of creation.

—Christopher Wright

To encounter God is to change.

—Dietrich Bonhoeffer

Austin Stone is a church in Austin, Texas (as its name suggests). It was planted by Matt Carter and Chris Tomlin in 2003 with a vision to reach young adults on the local university campus. Due in part to Tomlin’s musical gifts and leadership, the church developed an exuberant spiritual vibe based largely on offering inspiring and challenging worship services for young adults. The church grew phenomenally, reaching around 5,000–5,500 in weekend attendances in only six years! Talk about worship-led revival!¹

Sometime during this period, Matt Carter was diagnosed with cancer, which was surprising for a guy his age and alarming for the young church that he was leading. It was a time for serious spiritual reflection for Matt and the whole team. Matt took extended leave to recover, pray, and seek God for mercy and guidance. While passionately seeking God and his Word, he was constantly confronted with the prophetic passages that called into question the spiritual veracity of worship, particularly when by and large the people were not acting in conformity to God’s commands ... especially in relation to justice and the care for the poor (Isa. 56:1–7; 58:1–14; Jer. 14:12; Amos 6:8; Matt. 15:8). Matt felt that God had utterly nailed him and was asking him to repent and change the church’s ways—and this from a church that had built so much on excellent praise and worship.

Returning to work cancer-free, Matt and the team, guided by missional activist Michael Stewart, began to completely revise the focus of their church around mission to the needy people of the city. And because the team had already started to seriously grapple with missional issues, it wasn’t hard to win them over. Knowing that God was speaking to them, they began to wholeheartedly put themselves to the task.

First up, they had to deal with a massive problem: as is usual for a fast-growing church, they needed a building and had just put in bids for a big piece of property in the suburbs of Austin. The move to the burbs tends to be the way these things usually go—and it suited the demographics: most of those attending were college students, grads, and others drawn mainly from white middle-class backgrounds, and given the spate of marriages and new families, downtown didn’t feel quite so natural for them anymore.

In what can only be labeled a magnificent act of spiritual courage and leadership, they decided to pass on the move to the suburbs and instead establish themselves as “a church-for-the-city-that-happens-to-meet-on-weekends” in inner-city Austin—in effect they moved into “the hood,” with all the associated drugs, crime, poverty, and welfare issues synonymous with many American inner cities.

The property they now inhabit (appropriately called For The City Center) is not a church building but is a community development center built on the idea of sensitivity to the local issues of the people in the neighborhood. This move toward a more consistent missional model of church has meant that they have had to fundamentally rethink their model of ministry and adopt a more fluid movement model. This in turn has meant that they have transitioned their small groups into being missional communities, in effect creating micro-churches organized within a citywide movement still called Austin Stone. Mission is the defining motivation of the movement, and the church continues to explode in new churches, creativity, and conversion. Without doubt, Austin Stone is now one of the leading edge megachurches that has fundamentally redefined itself around being a missional movement in their city.

This story is a good one to start this chapter on because it embodies the very message we want to convey here: that mission must be allowed to once again fundamentally reshape our understanding of church. And why is this the case? Because we believe that somewhere in the nest of paradigms contained in the phrase “missional church” lies nothing less than the future viability of Western Christianity.

One of the great problems we face is the prevailing disconnect between God’s mission and God’s church. This utterly disastrous divorce must be overcome if we are to advance in our day.

As long ago as 1926, the great missiologist Roland Allen was forecasting the tragedy of outsourcing mission from the life of the church:

> We have two organizations for missionary work, one modern, the missionary society, and the other ancient, the Church. But when we consider the organization of the Church today as an organization for missionary work, we must not expect to find it unimpaired in its original purity. In the beginning the Church was a missionary society: it added to its numbers mainly by the life and speech of its members attracting to it those who were outside. Where they went churches were organized, where they settled, men who had never heard of the Church saw the Church, and, being attracted by the life, or by the speech, of its members, learned its secret, joined it, and were welcomed into it. Today members of the Church are scattered all over the world, but they do not carry the Church with them in their own persons, they were not organized, they very often do not desire the conversion of those among whom they live, they do not welcome them into the Church. So societies are formed to do this for them. The Church, as a Church, is not a missionary society enlarging its borders by multiplying local churches; so societies are formed within it to do its work for it.²

Like Allen, we are not casting aspersions on the motivations of the founders of those societies. They were responding to the great need of the world at that time. In the flurry of activity that accompanied the so-called Great Century of mission, foreign mission boards were springing up everywhere, each focused on a certain region of the world, each committed to reaching the world within their lifetime. The nineteenth century was a time of extraordinary expansion in every other field of life. Why not the area of mission as well? But the inadvertent outcome was that it left behind a local church without any real sense of direct involvement in mission and little or no experience of the adventure that it brings. It was the missionaries who became the brave storm troopers of Christianity, slashing their way through jungles, going where no one had gone before. Mission was now reserved for work among the unreached nations and no longer simply happened next door or around the corner. But the churches that had outsourced their missionary activity to the mission societies tended to drift languidly into the role as fundraiser for the mission societies. This dilemma was seriously exacerbated when, after World War II, a number of parachurch societies, mainly aimed at reaching young people, were formed. These included Youth for Christ, the Navigators, Campus Crusade for Christ, and so on, and were aimed at reaching students and teens right under the noses of existing churches. Once again, mission was outsourced to specialist agencies, leaving the local church focused primarily around pastoral issues and Sunday worship. Not only did this create the great stepchild, the parachurch, it crippled the church’s witness beyond the Sunday gathering. And again, given the significant cultural effect of the post-war baby boom, we understand the historical reasons why such specialization of local mission occurred. But it only deepened the cleft between missionary activity and church activity. Again, long before all this happened, Roland Allen was deeply concerned.

> We may compare the relation of the societies to the Church with the institution of divorce in relation to marriage. Just as divorce was permitted for the hardness of men’s hearts because they were unable to observe the divine institution of marriage in its original perfection, so the organization of missionary societies was permitted for the hardness of our hearts, because we had lost the power to appreciate and to use the divine organization of the Church in its simplicity for the purpose for which it was first created.³

In the end Allen himself despondently capitulated to this great divorce, concluding that “the divine perfection of the Church as a missionary society cannot be recovered simply by abolishing the missionary societies, and saying, let the Church be her own missionary society.”⁴

Maybe not in 1926, but today there is an increasing unease with this “divorce” between mission and church. Allen was ahead of his time. He forecast the situation we now find ourselves in—with missionless churches and churchless missions, and neither one being all it should be. We contend that the whole missional church conversation was one that the church has been building toward for over a century. And now is the time to have it. A new generation of young Christians is desperate for the adventure of mission. They were raised in the hermetically sealed environment of missionless church, and those who have emerged with their faith still intact are hungry for the risk and ordeal that only true missional activity can offer.

The appetite for adventure and risk is not exclusive to young Christians. In fact, it seems to be a fundamental yearning, knitted into the fabric of the human soul. Where there is no genuine adventure to undertake, we create pseudoadventures of extreme sports: bungee jumping, leaping off skyscrapers, and caving without a torch. Of course, all extreme sports are expressions of our appetite for adventure, but even a game of touch football or beach volleyball is an adventure of sorts, or at least a taste of the real thing.

In missionless churches, there is no adventure. You might get invited to be an usher or to join the church’s finance board and perhaps run a Bible study group if you are really good, but there is little by way of genuine communitas, because there is little by way of liminality. It’s a simple equation: no liminality, no adventure; no adventure, no mission; no mission, no communitas.

## Is a Can Opener a Can Opener ... ?

As we explain in *The Shaping of Things to Come*,⁵ one of the “trick questions” we use to get group discussion going around the idea of purpose is, “Is a can opener a can opener if it can’t open cans anymore?” This usually initiates a lively discussion around the idea of essence versus function. When the discussion turns to the application to the idea of church, it generates insight into the issue of purpose of the church. Is the church simply a church because it confesses Christ, or is there some functional test that must be applied? When answering the question, “What do you do with a can opener that doesn’t open cans anymore?” most people will say that unless it is fixable, it is not fulfilling that which it was designed for and it should be thrown away.

Without getting too heavy about it, and recognizing that we do live by the grace and love of God, we must recognize that in the Hebraic worldview, fruitfulness and functionality are very important and tend to trump the concept of “essence,” which derives largely from Platonic idealism and Greek philosophy. (Idealism basically states that concepts and ideas are real in themselves and are the essence of reality, and forms are just expressions of preexisting ideas.) This is why Jesus always applies the very Hebraic test of fruitfulness to any claims of belief (e.g., Matt. 7:16–20; 12:33; 21:19; Luke 3:8; 13:6–9; John 15; Rev. 2–3). The ultimate test of faithfulness in the Scriptures is not correct intellectual belief (e.g., Matt. 25; Luke 6:46; James 2:12, 21–26) but rather an ethical-functional one—in 1 John it is whether we love or fail in love; in James it is faith with works, about how we care for widows and orphans; in the letters of Peter it is our capacity to suffer in our witness for Jesus; in Hebrews to stay true to the journey. And as politically incorrect as it is to say it, judgment regarding fruitfulness is a vital aspect of the revelation of God in the Scriptures (e.g., John 15; Rev. 2–3; as well as the many parables of judgment that lace Jesus’s teachings).

It is clear by now that we believe one of the best ways to ensure the church remains true communitas is to constantly factor mission into the equation. Mission provides the church with ongoing liminality, because driven by a holy discontent with the sinful status quo, and expressing the purposes of the kingdom of God, it always impels us to pursue a more faithful, God-soaked future. The church should be shaped by mission because mission has a distinct God-shape to it. We are missional because God is missional. How can God’s people be otherwise (Eph. 5:1)? Drawing on the can opener metaphor above, we don’t believe that a church is a church if mission is taken out of the equation—or at least it won’t be a “church” for long. This is why we are on record claiming that the missional conversation—refactoring mission back into the equation of church—contains the seeds of authenticity and renewal for Christianity in our time and place.

So, here we feel the need to look at how adventure and liminality lead us into a deeper experience of missional Christianity. To do this we will put this conversation about mission-shaped community into its broader context by relating it to the other elemental functions of the church—namely, worship, community, and discipleship.

## What on Earth Is the Church For?

We are regularly asked to define what we mean by the phrase missional church. Those who ask us are generally looking for a description of a new “model” or a particular style of church. Used to recent innovations like the seeker-sensitive church, the megachurch, the organic church, the emerging church, etc., they assume the missional church must be another such innovation. We get the impression they’re looking for a newly minted approach that can be described in a few brief statements. Our standard answer is to say that a missional church is simply any church that organizes itself around the mission of God in this world. Because it is about incarnational contextualization in any and every possible culture, it cannot be about a particular style of worship or an innovative model of leadership. It’s not even concerned with any particular set of creedal statements. Any church of orthodox biblical beliefs can (and ought to), in theory at least, become missional. So it’s certainly possible to imagine a missional Presbyterian church or a missional Baptist church, or for that matter, a missional Arminian church or a missional Calvinist church—or further, a missional emerging church, or a missional house church, or a missional simple church.

The missional church is not a new trend or the latest new technique for reaching postmodern people. It is a way of doing and being church that transcends the particular predilections or preferences of its members. It is a radical challenge to many churches because it is not proposing an “add-on” to what a church might currently do. It is proposing a return to the center, a comprehensive recalibration of the church, a rediscovery of mission as its organizing function. So what does it mean to make mission the organizing function of a church?

## The Marks of the Church

Ever since the Reformation, Protestants have sought to define their understanding of the church with reference to a series of functions, or what they called “the marks of the church.” The earliest Reformers, in fact, concluded that we should look for three basic marks to identify the true church:

- the preaching of the gospel,
- the proper administration of the sacraments, and
- the right exercise of church discipline.⁶

It was stated that where these three marks are clearly present, we may rest assured we have found the church of the Lord Jesus Christ.⁷ In more recent times, evangelicals have likewise developed an understanding of the nature of the church based around its functions. They have listed a number of functions that should be seen as indispensable indications that a group of Christians is indeed “churching” together. While these lists can include as many as fifteen or more functions, we believe that the functions of ecclesia are captured in four primary categories—namely, worship, community, discipleship, and mission. These four functions are centered around, and serve, the defining reality of the Triune God.⁸

```
mission        community
      \         /
       God the Trinity
      /         \
discipleship   worship
```

**The Four Key Functions of Ecclesia**

Let’s look at them briefly:

We believe that worship is a core, indispensable, and nonnegotiable function of the church. In fact, in our campaign to encourage a missional understanding for the church, we are often misunderstood as minimizing or reducing the importance of worship in the Christian church. If we have been seen that way, it is clearly a miscommunication or misunderstanding. We wish to say in no uncertain terms that worship is an irreplaceable function in the Christian experience. We think the church should worship because our God is worthy to be worshiped. It is our response to the one holy God, who is above all. The church needs to worship. Worship isn’t necessary for God; it is, however, very necessary for us, for it is only as *homo adorans*, participating in the very life of the Holy Trinity, that we become truly human. As the psychologist says in Peter Shaffer’s play *Equus*, “If you don’t worship, you’ll shrink.”

Worship therefore is not a utility but an offering, that is, a sacrifice, an economy of grace that interrupts and critiques the feverish cycles of production and consumption, which is why the collection is not fund-raising but cultural critique. If you want relevance, excitement, or profit, go to a rally, a concert, or the stock exchange. And while on this, before we boil worship down to evangelism, education, or ethics, we should remember these are the possible by-products and never the motives of worship. They are blessings given as worship acts to recondition our hearts and reshape our disordered characters. However, without diminishing the importance of the corporate praise and worship experience, we wish to also be clear that worship must be understood as being far more than a gathered worship service. As Alan has made clear in *The Forgotten Ways*, worship involves offering our world back to God. It means that bringing all aspects of life under the lordship of God is our central act of worship. It is our natural response to who he is and what he has done. All of life belongs to God, and true holiness and true worship means bringing all the spheres of our life under his supreme lordship.⁹

We do not deny that gathered worship meetings are a profound expression of submission to Jesus’s lordship, as well as a wonderful expression of our adoration and praise for God collectively. But we must continue to remind ourselves that such worship services don’t make God present. They should presuppose his presence. But God’s presence is unlike any other. It is apophatic: “God does not exist,” said Kierkegaard, “he is eternal.” Without this apophatic point of departure, worship inevitably becomes idolatrous.

Another irreplaceable function of the church is the painstaking and lifelong fashioning of a genuine Jesus community (or fellowship in a previous parlance). This is the idea expressed by the Greek New Testament term, *koinonia*. To put it crudely, if worship describes a vertical relationship between God and his people, then community is the horizontal dimension: the relationship between God’s people. This would include all the communal aspects of church life: the deepening of relational bonds, the exercise of spiritual gifts, mutual encouragement and accountability, the sharing of resources, and so forth.

In Christ, we have fellowship with the family of God and with God himself. *Koinonia* is used in the New Testament to denote several aspects of our fellowship together. It can imply the sharing of the Lord’s Supper (1 Cor. 10:16), the sharing of our time and energy (Heb. 13:16), and the contribution of our material possessions (Rom. 15:26). All three usages of the word suggest a commonality of purpose, partnership, and interest.

More important, Christian community is not something about which we can arbitrarily make decisions—it is not an optional extra. One does not decide to “fellowship” with one person or another. Fellowship with other Christians is a by-product of our fellowship with God. Just as worship shows a reordering of the habits of our hearts toward God, community is the demonstration that our disordered characters have been reshaped.

This indissoluble link between fellowship with God and fellowship with his people is a key concern in John’s First Epistle. In 1 John 1:3 we find: “We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.”

Discipleship is clearly a core function of the church—heck, it’s in the Great Commission itself (Matt. 28:18–20). The essential task of discipleship is to equip believers to embody the message of Jesus. Others have referred to this as formation: that is, the formation of individuals and the church as a whole more into the likeness of Christ. Borrowing from C. S. Lewis, we referred to this in our previous book *ReJesus* as the formation of “little Jesuses.” In fact, Lewis himself said, “If the church is not doing this, then all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible, are a waste of time.”¹⁰ Such a fashioning of little Jesuses will necessarily require the ministries of teaching, admonishment, correction, rebuke, encouragement, etc.

But the primary motivation for discipleship should come from our devotion to Jesus as Lord. In other words, submitting oneself to the process of discipleship is in itself an act of worship. It too involves offering my world back to God. Being discipled is in fact a communal activity, because no one person can be ultimately or totally responsible for the mature development of another. This was behind Paul’s idea of the church as a body (see 1 Cor. 12). The gifts of the Spirit are given for the common good (1 Cor.12:7) and different people with different giftings will contribute to each person’s spiritual development as a Christian. Discipleship is an activity of Christian community as well as an expression of personal worship.

Evangelicals have often placed teaching in their list of required functions, seeing the proper teaching of the Word of God as an essential part of a biblical church. We agree with the essential nature of Bible teaching, but we would rather see that reset within the broader function of the church’s duty to make disciples. In other words, we should be less a teaching community and more of a learning community where all are on the journey of becoming mature followers of Christ. Unfortunately for many churches, their engagement with teaching can be reduced to simply listening to sermons. We would rather see the sermon as one tool among many in the development of mature disciples in Christ. Again, and not to sound defensive, we have often been misunderstood in this respect. We are not opposed to preaching at all. But we see it as a means to an end, not an end in itself. The end, if you will, is mature, godly disciples. The sermon will be part of the church’s armory in equipping such disciples.

The fourth function the church should be committed to is mission. Others prefer to be more explicit about the aspects of mission, such as evangelism or witness, or service or social justice, but we are persuaded that the broader category of mission includes all of this. For us, mission is the best term for describing both the announcement of the lordship of Jesus (evangelism, witness) and its demonstration (social concern, service). Mission is not simply all the church does in service of that which is outside itself: society, culture, the environment, etc. No, mission is what the church does in service of God.¹¹ “Mission is more and different from recruitment to our brand of religion; it is the alerting people to the universal reign of God through Christ.”¹²

Mission is the practical demonstration, whether by speech or by action, of the glorious lordship of Jesus. It is where we get to create little foretastes of the kingdom of Jesus, which has come and is still yet to fully come. If in that kingdom-to-come there will be no unbelief, then the church’s mission is to create such a foretaste by commending belief to all. If in the kingdom-to-come there will be no injustice, the church’s mission will be to work to eliminate injustice here and now. If in the kingdom-to-come there is no grief, no mourning, no suffering, the church’s mission is to overcome such things today. Mission, then, is an expression of worship, for it too involves offering our world back to God.

## The Church with Four Pillars

This might seem rudimentary ecclesiology, but it’s important that we be upfront about our foundational assumptions from the outset. When we argue for a mission-shaped church, we are not saying that mission ought to take priority over worship, community, or discipleship; and we are certainly not arguing for a mission-only church, as some have presumed—we would never survive, and it would be profoundly unbiblical anyhow. We don’t see how it’s possible to be a church that doesn’t worship, or a church without a communal life, or one that doesn’t engage in discipleship and disciple making. We believe all four functions are integral to the purpose of the church as Jesus designed it to be. In fact, all these purposes, or marks, are deeply interconnected, reliant upon, and stimulated by each other. The interconnections are obvious when you start looking for them.

Jesus told his disciples, “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another” (John 13:34–35). When we experience the unconditional love of Jesus, it will be expressed as love for others. Here is the indissoluble union between worship and community of which we spoke earlier. But when unbelievers observe this love, it becomes missional. Thus the Christian community witnesses to the reign of God. We defy the reader to unravel worship, community, discipleship, and mission from each other in these two verses. So too, when I feed the hungry in Jesus’s name, I am worshiping God. When I shelter the homeless or visit those in prison, or when I lead a friend to Christ, it too is worship. Need some more examples? Consider the practice of sharing the Lord’s Supper. Is it an act of worship? Christians have placed its practice in the center of their worship services. It is seen, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the denomination, as a central rite, or act of worship, for the Christian community. But is it not also an expression of community? Paul is at pains to express, not only the devotional or worshipful aspect of the feast, but the communality revealed in it as well (1 Cor. 10:17). Indeed, in his teaching on the Lord’s Supper, he moves back and forth between addressing it as an expression of the lordship of Jesus (worship) and an expression of the oneness of the Christian family (community).

But the practice of the communion feast could quite legitimately be seen as a missional activity. Again, Paul tells us, “For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes” (1 Cor. 11:26). The feast has an evangelistic aspect. It is a physical, enacted proclamation of the gospel. But we hasten to add, Paul also saw it as an expression of personal and corporate discipleship. When partaking of the communion meal, we are encouraged to reflect on our journey of faith and to seek to respond to the grace of God in Jesus in a manner worthy of his sacrifice. Paul again:

> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. (1 Cor. 11:27–29)

This process of “examining oneself” puts personal piety and discipleship at the center of the feast. By simply taking a central biblical Christian activity as an example, we can see how all four broader functions of the church are inherently involved. We could do this for any biblically required activity. Baptism, for instance, is an act of discipleship (dying to self) and an expression of community (being baptized into the church). It is a distinctly missional activity (personal, public proclamation) and a deeply moving act of worship (offering our bodies as our true worship God—Rom. 6, 12).

So it’s not about deciding which function to put at the center—that place belongs to Jesus as Lord anyhow. Nor is it about which function is more important than the other. Besides, as we’ve stated, it’s impossible to separate them anyway, theologically as well as in practice. For us, the question that needs to be asked is not which function should be central or should be given but rather to explore which one of them is the best catalyst for the others.

## Mission as Catalysis

In chemistry a catalyst is a substance that either initiates or accelerates a chemical reaction. For any chemical process to occur, energy, known as activation energy, is required. Without the help of a catalyst, the amount of energy needed to spark a particular reaction is high. When the catalyst is present, the activation energy introduced makes the reaction happen more efficiently. The catalyst generally works by either changing the structure of a molecule or by bonding to reactant molecules, causing them to combine, react, and release a product or energy. For example, a catalyst is required for oxygen and hydrogen gases to combine and form water. Without the help of a catalyst, chemical reactions might never occur or take a significantly longer period of time to react.¹³ When we use the term in social settings, it carries over this idea of activating something: we refer to something that causes an important event to happen (e.g., “the invasion acted as a catalyst to unite the country”). It is precisely in this sense that mission is the catalyst for the other functions—it is catalytic: it both activates the others (worship, community, discipleship) and/or makes the others work far more effectively and authentically.

We hope in this chapter to convince you of the sheer revitalizing power of mission as catalysis, but we have to admit up front that is generally not accepted in the inherited or prevailing understandings of church, or at least has not been for a very long time now. This is why the missional conversation seems to be such a new one. For way too long now the church has been satisfied to allow worship to act as the organizing principle of the rest. This is most evident in the way that the Sunday/weekend worship services have become the epicenter of a church’s life. This is not just true as one might expect in the high/traditional churches, but also in contemporary church. Most of the staff’s effort, and most of the budget, goes into producing the weekend worship experiences focused on and around various demographic groups (youth, young adults, families, oldies, etc.).

This practice has deep roots in our ecclesiology. It emerged during the earliest days of European Christendom and has rarely been thoroughly critiqued—hence the dominance it plays in our idea of the church. For the more institutional church that was birthed in the fourth century and developed during the Medieval period, the Mass, which demonstrated the very presence of Christ in his church, became the center of the weekly worship gathering, and for obvious reasons: if you really believed (as the Constantinian church did) that the elements of the Eucharist were literally the body and blood of Christ, and that the ordained priest in offering the Mass was participating in a New Testament reinterpretation of temple worship, you would place it in the center of the community life. That’s where Jesus belongs! But now it’s all tied up with the priestly and churchly apparatus. When the church began to see itself as the mediating, temple-like institution interceding between God and humanity, it quickly asserted its presence in the life of the church through regular attendance at worship.

The temple always had a central role in Israel’s life, and so the church, seeing itself as the new Israel, and in embedding the grace of God into the institution, developed its ecclesiology around this assumed temple-theology. But this to our mind was the deepest theological error; because by substituting itself as the Christian temple, it basically displaced Jesus’s role as living, ever-present Mediator and Reconciler in the life of people. As we asserted in *ReJesus*, Jesus was/is himself the new Temple. He did everything that a temple was meant to do—providing once and for all a location where all could meet with God. When the church recasts itself as the temple, it takes on a meaning and significance that really belongs to Jesus ... a very dangerous and idolatrous substitution indeed.

But when this incipient temple-theology wedded with the social and political power of the State, a Christian civilization emerged with the church at the spiritual epicenter—for that’s where temples are, at the center. As a result, the culture was baptized, everyone became “Christian” and all were expected, often on pain of penalty or social censure, to be baptized and attend worship. When early Roman Europe became “Christianized” in this way, mission became defunct, and formal worship, maintained by priesthood, effectively trumped the other elements of the ecclesial mix. The fact that community, mission, and discipleship are not even mentioned in the “marks of the church” only proves the point—it’s all about the church-based sacraments, maintained by the temple clergy, and administered largely at regular meetings.

This formalization of worship through priesthood (generally variations of sacerdotalism) is not limited to Catholicism. Even after the Reformation, Protestants still kept the worship gathering as the locus of church life, replacing the elaborate Mass with Bible teaching, communion, and baptism. By so doing, the Protestant church uncritically allowed the worship experience to retain its catalytic and determining role over all other primary functions of the church. Even teaching (a subfunction of discipleship) was located at the worship meeting and therefore subsumed under it. Community building also occurred chiefly on Sundays during or after the worship meeting and has suffered the same fate. Likewise mission, such as it has been seen throughout the past 500 years, was also centered on worship. All this lies at the basis of what we have previously called the attractional model of evangelism: inviting your unsaved friends to a worship service to hear the message and respond.¹⁴

Likewise, this makes sense of why Christians refer to the building that houses the weekly worship meeting as “the church.” It leads to Christians referring to the fact that they “go to church.” This phrase in itself is biblically screwy and most Christians know it, but they can’t break from the default mode that tells them the worship experience organizes everything that we understand the church to be. We are so focused on the centrality of corporate worship that we cannot easily distinguish the place where we worship together from the function of worship corporately—it’s a classic case of form triumphing over function.

So much is the worship seen as catalyst that in most cases planting a new church is perceived as being synonymous with launching a new worship service! The assumption is that if we start a new worship meeting, a church will emerge from that regular meeting. In other words, when we let worship do the organizing, we still end up with community and discipleship and mission, but they all emerge from, and play second fiddle to, the corporate worship dimension of church. We still, after seventeen centuries, operate largely out of a Constantinian understanding of church. Worship as organizing/catalyzing function can be represented by the following diagram:

## Mission as Organizing Principle

Because community and discipleship as marks or functions have rarely ever been given the catalyzing role, it’s hard to point to examples as to what happens when these in fact inform and enrich the rest. Perhaps the Jesus People movement of the ’60s and ’70s is a good example, but even this dissolved into church-based worship with the charismatic renewal and the rise of Calvary Chapel–style teach-ins. Certainly there have been movements that have highlighted discipleship around Jesus—many reforming movements fit into this genre. When discipleship is the central function, then ethics, nonviolence, and living counterculturally become the overwhelming impulses in the life of the church. There is no question about the communal beauty in such a life—and the impact of discipleship on the quality of Christian witness. And of course disciples worship God. But we suggest that this too is not the best catalyzing function. For instance, when discipleship is not guided by the outward impulses of mission, it tends to become narrow, legalistic, and retreats to the private pietism of “the persecuted little flock” mentality that easily infuses Anabaptist forms of ecclesia, for example. Out to the country we go, away from the contamination of worldly culture, the aim being to avoid all contact with that which defiles the purity of the pious soul. But this too inflicts a distortion in our sense of the divine purpose of the church. Is discipleship not meant to be lived as an incarnational witness at the heart of the real-time communities where people live? A retreatist spirituality is not a spirituality that can, or will, transform the world in Jesus’s name.

Likewise there are movements that have emphasized the importance of community. Many of the monastic orders fit into this category. Of course worship, mission, and discipleship were a part of the equation, but they tended to serve the overall purpose of generating community. And once again, elements of Anabaptist theology lend itself to this. When the most important thing that matters is being together—when community organizes the other functions—then there is likely to be a very rich sense of relationships between brothers and sisters, but such love would always live in the shadow of the ever-present threat of its becoming the cloying, controlling community-for-its-own-sake that we critiqued in the chapter on communitas. The Christian community is meant to exist for more than itself. As William Temple once observed, the church is the only society in the world that exists for the benefit of the nonmembers.¹⁵ We forget this to our peril.

So, we feel that we need to develop a mission-shaped view of the church, not a church-shaped view of mission. Mission as catalyzing principle might look something like this:

```
      mission

community  discipleship  worship
```

**Mission as Organizing Principle**

Again, we affirm that all four functions need to be present to be a healthy, fruitful, functioning church as the Bible intends it. We suggest that when mission guides and informs the others, the worship is truly understood as offering our world back to God. It becomes a world-redeeming, missional affair. When mission guides discipleship, becoming more Christlike is not just seen in narrow pietistic terms, but recognizes that in my salvation-sanctification God has laid the seeds of redemption of my world, that God’s agenda works itself out through the very medium of my life. My life matters, and how I live it matters in relation to God’s missional agenda, because the medium is the message. When mission guides our being with others, then we recognize that the community doesn’t just exist for me, but rather that I serve Jesus in the community and that the community itself exists for the world. The church plays an irreplaceable role in God’s plan of redemption. When mission guides all these, we get to show the world how to live the love of the Father, through the lordship of the Son, and in the power of the Holy Spirit.

We will try to make the case from three viewpoints:

- theological,
- sociological, and
- practical.

### Theological/Biblical

With the rediscovery of missional theology over the past century has come the awareness that the nature and character of God are best understood in terms of his mission. Indeed, the whole biblical narrative is testament to this. God is a missionary God. It is impossible to conceive of the biblical God without seeing God in terms of his mission, which is not merely the activity of God but the revelation of his very character.

David Bosch traces this missional framework for understanding God right from the creation narratives in Genesis: “In creation, God was already the God of mission, with his Word and Spirit as ‘Missionaries’” (cf. Gen. 1:2–3).¹⁶ The sending out of his Word (“and God said”) to create order in the previously chaotic cosmos is a missional activity in the same way that the breathing out of his Spirit upon humankind was an expression of the *missio Dei*. Then the history of Israel is a relentless unfolding of the missionary character of God as he continued to send himself out after his people and in spite of their continued disobedience. But God’s self-revelation reaches its climax in the incarnation and the resultant trinitarian formulation. Bosch continues:

> God likewise sent his incarnate Word, his Son, into the world. And he sent his Spirit at Pentecost. Mission is God giving up himself, his becoming man, his laying aside of his divine prerogatives and taking our humanity, his moving into the world, in his Son and Spirit.¹⁷

The mistake the church made during the Christendom period was to assume that mission was simply God’s unsavory but necessary activity in a sinful world. What recent scholars like Bosch, Lesslie Newbigin, Darrell Guder, and others have helped us rediscover is that mission lies at the very center of God’s nature. Bosch again:

> Mission [is] understood as being derived from the very nature of God. It [is] thus put in the context of the doctrine of the Trinity, not of ecclesiology or soteriology. The classical doctrine of the *missio Dei* as God the Father sending the Son, and God the Father and the Son sending the Spirit [is] expanded to include yet another “movement”: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit sending the church into the world.¹⁸

It makes sense when put so simply. If the clearest way God chose to reveal himself to this world was by the incarnation of his Son, then it follows that the incarnation tells us a very central thing about God—he is a missionary. He is the sent and sending God. Jesus is not merely sent from the Father, he is sent as God, revealed in human terms.

Therefore it is impossible to hold to a nonmissional understanding of the God of Scripture, and it should follow that God’s people should likewise be constituted by the *missio Dei*. As Leonard Sweet puts it, “The church does not define its mission. God does. It is God’s mission in the world that concocts the church, not the other way around.”¹⁹

At one level, we must understand the Trinity in missional terms. The Father sends the Son, and the Father and the Son send the Spirit. We can’t only speculate on the Trinity in terms of community (three in one, working together), but in terms of sending. Therefore, if God’s people are a sent people, mission must be seriously considered as the organizing or catalyzing function of the church.

Basically we think mission is the catalyzing function because God is the *missio Dei*—the missionary God. The church is the net result of God’s missionary activity in the world, and not only is it the recipient of God’s saving mercy, but it exists to live out and extend the gospel of the kingdom in this world. In other words, God’s redeeming activity in our lives is the reason why we are in the church in the first place, and mission is therefore built into the very purpose of the church.

### Historical/Sociological

If the doctrine of the *missio Dei* is not enough to convince us of the catalyzing power of mission (and it should be), there are the unique historical and cultural challenges facing the church in the West today that force us to rethink this issue. Put simply, the church finds itself in a post-Christendom era, and it had better do some serious reflection or face increasing decline and eventual irrelevance.

In the days when people in the West believed churchgoing was a good and decent thing to do, and made assumptions about God from a broadly biblical Christian framework, inviting them back to a church service might well have been an effective form of outreach. Today, we can no longer assume unbelievers are sitting at home waiting for a better worship service to arrive in town. A church organized around worship makes the Sunday gathering the primary doorway to God, gospel, and community. And while people in a post-Christendom West might be yearning for community, having to enter via the worship service is proving to be somewhat culturally unpalatable for vast tracts of the population. Besides, the Christians aren’t the only game in town anymore. If I’m overcome by existential yearning, I now have a plethora of spiritual options to try. Darrell Guder says,

> The obvious fact that what we once regarded as Christendom is now a post-Constantinian, post-Christendom, and even post-Christian mission field stands in bold contrast today with the apparent lethargy of established church traditions in addressing their situation both creatively and faithfully. Yet this helpfully highlights the need for and providential appearance of a theological revolution in missional thinking that centers the body of Christ on God’s mission rather than post-Christendom’s concern for the church’s institutional maintenance.²⁰

Well, we hope so! In many quarters, the shrinking church constituency has been greeted by ever more energetic attempts to get people to attend on Sundays. In Britain recently, the Baptist church undertook a nationwide “Back to Church Sunday” campaign to get presumably lapsed Baptists or lapsed churchgoers to attend a worship service. In Texas, a megachurch in Houston gives away a free Wii to children who attend their kids’ program and who then bring their parents to church. Another church in California gives away a Harley Davidson motorbike every year to the attendee who brings the most number of friends to church. Most churches don’t have the resources for these tricks and inducements but are still bound to the imagination that church happens on a Sunday in a building. A sad expression of this attractional, service-based mission was from an Anglican church in Australia that advertised it would give a box of chocolates to anyone who would care to visit (!). It’s like we are reduced to begging people to come ... and it’s not only pathetic, it borders on false witness.

If only we could discover what a church organized by mission looked like—one that saw itself as a sending church, not an indragging church. Sadly, it seems the situation in the West needs to get even worse for the church before its leaders come to terms with the new world in which they live. As the authors of *The Prodigal Project* say,

> The Christian church is dying in the West. This painful fact is the cause of a great deal of avoidance by the Christian community.... Surely God will not let his church come to death? And yet the history of the church in North Africa teaches us that we cannot assume divine intervention to maintain the status of the ecclesiastical institution. It is not only possible for Christianity in the West to falter, it is apparent that the sickness is well advanced.²¹

But as for the sheer renewing power of mission, we believe that history is on our side here. Theologians and church historians have long recognized that a movement of mission is almost always associated with, or precipitates, renewal movements in the church.²² The Celtic missionary movement was directly linked to a deep and abiding love for God, nature, people, and learning, and birthed the Celtic monasteries that attached themselves to, and served, various villages across Ireland and later Europe. The Wesleyan revivals that started as mission and evangelism in Industrial England became the worldwide Methodist renewal of communities, discipleship, and worship. Pentecostalism, which started at the Azusa Street Mission among profoundly poor and disenfranchised people, is now a worldwide movement of over 500 million believers!

Third, in the light of *missio Dei* thinking and the challenges of post-Christendom, we think the contention of this book—that the adventure and risk of mission catalyzes and energizes worship, discipleship, and community—does indeed hold water. History and current experience provide many examples; the preceding chapters have made a case for this. But most readers have no further to look than your own experience. You may have undertaken some project like a short-term mission trip or have been part of a church planting team or a parachurch organization, or have participated in some form of church outreach. If so, you will know from your own experience that mission does not displace worship, or diminish the experience of Christian community or the depth of discipleship. On the contrary, if you reach into those experiences, you will find that all four functions of ecclesia were operating as they should. In the hardships and teamwork required by the mission, did you not experience rich comradeship with your brothers and sisters? Likewise, after experiencing something of what God is doing in the world, even some of God’s pain for the poor and broken, did you not pray like you never had before? When people came to faith and you saw miracles, did you not worship God with all that you are? When mission is allowed to be the catalytic function, the other elements of ecclesia are not in any way diminished; they are in fact enhanced.

Not only do we believe that we cannot be a disciple without mission, and that we cannot become a true communitas without it, so too we don’t think we can truly worship if we are not engaged in mission. We don’t have true community in isolation from the liminal situation, and patently just worshiping God on Sundays and midweek fellowships alone does not produce disciples—because if it did actually work, then there would be no crisis of discipleship in the church. And there quite clearly is such a crisis. The Willow Creek Association, the very heart of the contemporary worship movement, pretty much admitted this in their systemwide study *Reveal*.²³ It is pertinent to note here that we are always perfectly designed to produce what we are currently producing! Mission and discipleship and communitas are patently lacking while most of our resources go into weekend services.

If worship was meant to be the catalyzing principle, as is predominantly the case throughout the West, and as many (e.g., John Piper²⁴) assert, then by all accounts we should be rocking the world. Clearly, we are not. And as far as we can determine, Christianity is on the decline in every Western context. We hate to be the bearers of bad news, but apart from a very few exceptional places, non-Christian people are not exactly lining up to go to church anymore.

Let’s stop kidding ourselves—there are too many instances of Christians worshiping sublimely every Sunday, but never making an impact beyond the congregation, never experiencing the powerful beauty of communitas, and never going deeper in discipleship. We think this is precisely because the catalyzing experience of missional adventure and risk are removed from the equation.

Some will no doubt argue with us on this point, insisting there must be something deficient in any worship experience if it doesn’t propel people into greater godliness, greater service, greater fellowship with God and his people. Better hymns, more passionate worship, improved sermons ought to do the trick. Well, we’ll have to take their word for it, but it seems academic to us. For many churches, getting worship “right” in order to catalyze mission, community, and discipleship is like trying to win the lottery. Theoretically you can win the lottery, but it rarely happens. Besides, we have to ask whether anyone in the early church was won to faith in Christ because of its great music?

We say launch a collective of believers out into the deep seas of mission and the chances are extremely high that the adventure of mission will bring to life the other core functions of the church.

Think of mission like the paddles of a defibrillator applied to the chest of a dying church. A jolt of electricity can address the lethal arrhythmias of a patient with a cardiac condition, just like a jolt of mission can catalyze the other functions of the church back to full health. As Brian McLaren says,

> For all the obvious failures of “organized religion,” ... I see the power of organizing religion ... people of faith organizing for something truly beautiful and good. If there is a force in the world powerful and good enough to overcome [the world], it is to be found, not in organized religion seeking institutional self-preservation, but in religion organizing for the common good.²⁵

When a church embraces the call to mission, there is a ripple effect throughout every aspect of that church. Everything is shaped and directed toward the missional cause of our missional God. Instead of trying to fit God into our lives, missional Christianity asks where our lives (both individually and collectively) fit into God’s mission. Instead of looking for ways to make the gospel relevant, missional churches cooperate with God’s plan of transforming the world to meet the shape of the gospel. Instead of arguing about what can or cannot be included in the mission of the church, missional churches ask what kind of church God wants to shape for his mission. We may wonder about what kind of mission God has for my church, when we should be asking what kind of church God wants for his mission.²⁶
