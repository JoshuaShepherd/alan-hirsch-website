# Chapter 5: Getting Over Risk Aversion

## Extracting Truth from Dare

To dare is to lose one’s footing momentarily. To not dare is to lose oneself.

—Soren Kierkegaard

You tried your best, and you failed. The lesson is, never try.

—Homer Simpson

It shouldn’t be considered remarkable to note that the vast majority of the Bible was written by people facing significant danger and chaos. In fact, it is so replete throughout Scripture that any brief list seems inconsequential. The unique history of Israel begins with a single family being called to leave their homeland and journey to a distant and less hospitable place. It features the harrowing individual experiences of the exile Joseph in Egypt and later the servitude of the whole nation under Egypt’s oppression. That same history is written by the warrior-adventurer David, the mis-adventurer Job, the absconder Jonah, the expatriate Ruth, the melancholic Jeremiah.

It deals with Israel under threat, under attack, under exile, under condemnation. It features war, oppression, famine, flood, and the rise and fall of empires. And the New Testament is written in the context of the lifestyle of the adventurer-missionaries Paul and Peter and their compatriots. Anchoring all of this is the life of Christ, the persecuted and tormented one. Indeed, very little Scripture is written from the context of stability and security.

This is not to say that there weren’t times of relative stability—of course there were times of security and prosperity. But it is a curious fact that in such situations Israel (and church) were (are) not at their best—stability proves to be a far more dangerous experience to the spirituality and faithfulness of God’s people. Israel was often at her worst when things seemed to be going swimmingly. And church history proves it is not any different for the new covenant people of God. In light of this spiritual tendency, Israel is explicitly warned against forgetting the liminal revelations when entering the Promised Land (Deut. 6:10–12 and chaps. 28–32), not only commanding blessings on faithfulness, but curses on the faithlessness that was bound to come through dwelling in the land of promise. Her festivals were profoundly ritualized events that required the people not only to cognitively remember, but also to dynamically participate, in the events that formed Israel—e.g., Passover and Tabernacles recall the deliverance from Egypt and the sojourn in the desert. Once again, liminality plays an important role in developing faithfulness in God’s people.

## Searching for the Sweet Spot

This constant facing of danger and adapting to the challenges of life is not exclusive to the history of Israel or the founding of the Christian movement. In fact, the idea that all organization, biological and social, emerges from the crucible of chaos is grounded in the very structure of life itself. Chaos theory, the science of how living systems organize and develop, teaches us that

> nature is at its innovative best near the edge of chaos. The edge of chaos is a condition, not a location. It is a permeable, intermediate state through which order and disorder flow, not a finite line of demarcation. Moving to the edge of chaos creates upheaval but not dissolution; that’s why being on the edge is so important. The edge is not the abyss. It’s the sweet spot for productive change. And when productive agitation runs high, innovation often thrives and startling breakthroughs can come about. This elusive, much sought after, sweet spot is sometimes called “a burning platform.” The living sciences call it the edge of chaos.¹

The authors of *Surfing the Edge of Chaos* contend that any healthy, growing system needs to move toward the “sweet spot,” that zone where the system is under threat and forced to rediscover its inherent logic to move forward. Reflecting on the study of all living systems, they say the more static state of equilibrium or security is actually a precursor to death. “When a living system is in a state of equilibrium, it is less responsive to changes occurring around it. This places it at maximum risk.”²

It is so counterintuitive for a leader today to push his or her church toward chaos when everything within them tells them to move back to the center, to stability. But this takes us back to Heifetz’s understanding about the nature of adaptive leadership. Adaptive leadership moves the system to the edge of chaos—not over, but to the edge of it. Followers want comfort, stability, and solutions from their leaders, but that’s babysitting. Real leaders ask hard questions and knock people out of their comfort zones and then manage the resulting distress.³ The leader’s role therefore is to ensure that the system is directly facing up to the issues that confront it, issues that if left unattended, will eventually destroy it. If the organization never seriously faces the problem and stays with it for a reasonable time, it will never feel the need to move to find a genuine and more lasting solution—hence the idea of a “burning platform” mentioned above (and previously in chapter 1). We have long taught the simple formula that it is the role of transformative leadership to sell the problem before trying to evoke a solution. It is only when a church, or any group for that matter, is at this edge of chaos that real innovation takes place.

When Alan reflects back to his early days as the leader of a missional church in Melbourne in the early ’90s, he can see all the signs of living systems as proposed here. It was chaotic, fluid, dynamic, and highly missional. In fact, he can see now how that church was forced to go through at least three adaptive leaps during his time with them. Likewise with Michael’s current leadership of the missional community “Small Boat Big Sea,” which he planted in 2001—that community has also faced the need to make adaptive leaps as it has grown in numbers, as the makeup of its members has changed over time, and as it has been challenged to respond to the needs of its neighborhood. The point is that missional communities are at their very best when they are on the fringes. It is when they settle down and move away from the edge of chaos that things go awry.

By and large, churches are very conservative organizations, and after they have been around just a few years can quickly become somewhat more institutionalized, largely because of the Christendom mode and the assumptions underlying it, but also because of leadership style and influence. On the whole, churches seek to conserve the past, and particularly in the historical denominations their primary orientation is often backward to an idealized past rather than forward to a new vision of the future. As such they are often inflexible institutions that enshrine an inherited tradition. Hence, the mainline churches are leading the decline of the church in the West, due almost entirely to the fact that they are closed systems built squarely on an institutional systems story.

But when liminality, either deliberate or otherwise, is allowed to impact and inform the church, we are propelled outward toward the edge of chaos where it has to constantly adapt to the missional challenge it faces. It becomes the highly responsive learning organization that it should be. The role of leadership here is to continually unsettle the community, holding its feet to the fire of mission and marshalling the God-given potential that emerges in times of dissonance and uncertainty. Part of the key to effectively “surfing the edge of chaos” involves helping community members to overcome the toxic levels of risk aversion currently present in our churches. Because risk aversion is perhaps one of the major killers of adventurous discipleship and mission in the life of the church, it is worth taking a deeper look into it.

## The Remarkable Story of Risk

In his great tragedy *Prometheus Bound*, Aeschylus retells the legend of Prometheus, the Greek Titan and brother to Atlas, who stole fire from Zeus to give it to mortals. By sharing with humankind that which belonged only to the gods, he was condemned to suffer eternally by being bound to a rock while a great eagle ate his liver every day only to have it grow back to be eaten again the next day. The moral of the tale is that you shouldn’t even think about crossing the dividing line between immortals and mortals.

Borrowing from this idea, philosopher-economist Peter Bernstein penned *Against the Gods: the Remarkable Story of Risk*, in which he argues that the people who mastered the calculation of probabilities, beginning in sixteenth-century Italy, stole from the gods something much more precious than fire. They seized the knowledge of the understanding of risk. Given the current level of risk aversion present in so many churches, it will be helpful to have some insight into the nature and benefits of risk, particularly as it affects the formation of community.

It is Bernstein’s contention that by calculating probabilities we do the next best thing to seeing the future: we make intelligent decisions—and take control of our lives—on the basis of scientific forecasts. For Bernstein, the mastery of risk is the foundation of modern life, from insurance to the stock market to engineering, science, and medicine. In fact, he says, the mastery of risk is what divides modern from ancient times. The ancient Greeks, for example, adept as they were with numbers, regarded mathematics as belonging to the higher realm of intellectual pursuit, not the messiness of daily life. Amazingly, Bernstein says of ancient Greek dice-rolling, “Though people played these games with insatiable enthusiasm, no one appears to have sat down to figure the odds.”⁴ If anyone had, they would have cleaned up.

From the early 1500s there appeared a string of philosophers and mathematicians who did try to clean up, including such giants as Galileo, Pascal, Newton, Gauss, Poincare, von Neumann, and Keynes. Blaise Pascal, for instance, is best remembered as a religious philosopher, but as a callow young mathematician, he teamed up with Pierre de Fermat on a solution to an old conundrum: how to divide the stakes of an uncompleted gambling game. With its implications for prediction in other fields, Bernstein says, Pascal and Fermat’s solution became “the cornerstone of modern insurance and other forms of risk management.”⁵

In 1738 an interesting paradox in risk assessment came to light, courtesy of the Dutch-Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli. Known as the Petersburg paradox, it suggests a game between two men called Peter and Paul in which Peter tosses a coin continuously until it comes up heads. If it comes up heads on the first toss, Paul wins one ducat and the game is over. If it takes two tosses, Paul wins two ducats. If it takes three tosses, he wins four ducats, and so forth. The question is, how much should Paul be willing to pay to play this game with Peter?

The paradox is this: the standard calculation of expected value indicates that the value of playing the game is infinite. The calculation looks like this:

(½ × 1) + (¼ × 2) + (⅛ × 4) … = ½ + ½ + ½ … = infinity

Nevertheless, no ordinary person would be willing to pay more than a few ducats to play this game. Bernoulli’s explanation is that our assessment of the value of the winnings decreases as the probability of the winnings gets smaller. Mathematically, the probability of the game going to, say, twenty tosses, is 1/1,048,576, and the payoff is 524,288 ducats. However, although the expected value is still ½, the probability is so small that we effectively evaluate it as zero. In our minds, the expected value of the game is not the infinite series above, but a series that stops after ten or twenty terms.

As an experiment, some computer geek wrote a program to play this game a few million times and determine the average payout. It came out to around 10 ducats. He supposed you’d have to play an infinite number of games to get the infinite payoff, which certainly justifies our instinctive reluctance to value the game very highly if we only get to play once.

If all this math sounds a bit intimidating, the bottom line is that Bernoulli’s paradox necessarily invites a discussion about the way people rank risks. And for that discussion we need to speed through time from eighteenth-century Europe to twentieth-century America, because it was at Princeton in 1979 that Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky proposed Prospect Theory to describe the decisions people make between different risk options based on their perceived probabilities.

In effect, Prospect Theory says that people aren’t generally risk averse, they are loss averse. For example, give a group of people the choice of $1000 or a 50 percent chance of winning $2000 and most will choose the sure thing and take the $1000. However, give them a choice of losing $1000 immediately against a 50 percent chance of losing $2000, and most will take the risk. This offers an explanation for the fact that people who invest their life savings very conservatively will simultaneously buy lottery tickets. Apparently, this pattern of being unwilling to accept a sure loss has been verified over and over in a variety of circumstances and confirms something basic about human nature: people behave irrationally even when they know they are doing so.

To illustrate this, Bernstein relates an anecdote about a distinguished Soviet professor of statistics who showed up at an air-raid shelter during a German bombardment. Until then, he had scoffed at the prospect of being hit. What changed his mind? “Look,” he explained, “there are 7 million people in Moscow and one elephant. Last night, they got the elephant.”⁶

In the American film *Along Came Polly*, writer/director John Hamburg approaches this idea, albeit more ludicrously. The story centers on Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller), an actuary whose job is to analyze risk for insurance purposes. Naturally, as a risk analyst, he prefers to live his own life in complete safety and free from any unnecessary risk as well. This means that he considers such ordinary activities as salsa dancing or eating spicy Moroccan food to be too risky to undertake. His prized possession is a computer insurance program called the Risk Master, which he uses to measure clients’ risk in percentages.

When he meets the chaotic and free-spirited Polly (Jennifer Aniston) his risk-averse life is sent into a tailspin. He is attracted to Polly, but by every measurement he can think of, she is a disaster in terms of risky behavior. He tells her,

> I know that I have a .013 percent chance of being hit by a car on my way home. Or a one in 46,000 chance of falling through a subway grate. So I try to manage that risk by avoiding danger and having a plan and knowing what my next move is. And I guess you don’t exactly live your life that way. Yeah, which is great, but I’m not gonna ever be a dirty dancer, and I don’t eat food with my hands, and I really like you, but I just don’t think this is gonna work out.⁷

Of course, like all romantic comedies, things do work out for these two, but not before Reuben is forced to confront what would be lost and what gained if he lives his life by the Risk Master and lets the crazy Polly go. In this instance, losing Polly is worse for him than the gains of avoiding her anarchic lifestyle. It’s all about Reuben letting go of his need to control everything; it’s ultimately love that empowers him to do so.

Some church leaders can be very much like Reuben in this respect. They want to embrace the crazy, anarchic call to mission, but they are more afraid of what would be lost if they did so. Taking up the call to risky, liminal mission might sound appealing to them, but they fear the impact this might have on their congregations. They feel the weight of history on their shoulders and don’t want to be known as the pastor who led the congregation into chaos and disintegration. We acknowledge this anxiety, but we remind loss-averse church leaders of what could ultimately be lost if the call to missional adventure is finally rejected or even ameliorated. Missional adventure is like the free-spirited Polly—beautiful, disordered, hectic—and the possibility of losing her should frighten us more than the fears we have of losing members of our congregation, or our position, or the order in our lives. Like Reuben, only love can empower us to overcome our loss aversion.

These theories of risk assessment highlight how brilliant Jesus’s outlook on life was. He begins with our loss aversion, tackling it head-on from the very outset: “For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.” (Matt. 16:25). In fact, he repeats this proverbial statement over and over. It is a central theme in his teaching, and in all four Gospels.⁸ If we could be freed from our aversion to loss, our whole outlook on risk would change. We would be free indeed. Surely, then, this explains Paul’s monumental courage as we observed in the previous chapter.

His attitude to risk—dueling with wizards, debating scholars, staring down rioters—has grown from the fundamental assumption that he has nothing to lose. He has lost his life for Jesus’s sake and is truly free from fear. This is why he can dare to say, “May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world” (Gal. 6:14). And,

> I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! (Phil. 1:20–22)

Tough choice, whether to live or die, but they both hold attractions for Paul. In calling Christians to embrace the risk and adventure of mission, a starting point is the addressing of our core aversion to loss. We are averse to loss much more than we are attracted by gain. But this was an aversion that Paul had abandoned by the time he wrote to the Philippians. For him it was all gain, because he had lost his life for Jesus’s sake. This reminds us once again of Martin Luther King’s axiom that the true revolutionary is the person who has nothing to lose. This was undoubtedly Paul’s experience, and it appears to be central to our capacity to embrace risk.

In his book *The Myth of a Christian Religion*, Greg Boyd makes the helpful distinction between the pledge of life and the life we pledge. He explains:

> We all make an initial pledge to surrender our life to Christ, but the actual life we pledge to surrender is the life we live each moment after we make our initial pledge. For the only life we have to surrender is the life we live moment-by-moment.⁹

Pledging one’s life in some generalized, even grandiose, sense sounds impressive, but the reality as Boyd points out is that the pledge must be embraced and reembraced every moment thereafter. This is the life we pledge, every darn minute of it. This applies to the pledge a police officer or a judge might make. It’s not dissimilar to your local doctor taking the Hippocratic Oath. And we’ve all seen ceremonies where inductees of whatever kind are invited to “Repeat after me: I, say your name, do solemnly swear ...” But any of these oaths or pledges are only valuable to the degree that they are lived out day by day. Boyd illustrates his point using his marriage vows as an example. Referring to the promises he made to his wife nearly thirty years earlier, he says,

> But the actual life I pledged to my wife is the life I have lived each moment since I made that pledge. The quality of my marriage, therefore, isn’t decided by whether or not I made a pledge twenty-nine years ago. It’s decided by how I live out that pledge now.¹⁰

This is part of the key to understanding why many Christians seem so loss-averse. For many of them their relationship to Jesus is located in the pledge of life, not the life they pledged. Their understanding of the gospel as some magical get-out-of-jail-free card means that they are satisfied that their responsibility is simply a once-and-for-all decision made many years ago at an evangelistic rally. But to paraphrase Lesslie Newbigin, the gospel is concerned with the completion of God’s purpose in the creation of the world, not—to put it crudely—simply with offering a way of escape for the redeemed soul out of history. It is concerned with the work of God to bring history to its true end, a work to which we are all called to contribute. The loss of one’s life for Christ’s sake isn’t a once-and-for-all choice; it is a daily dying, a constant giving up of one’s own interests in the interest of the kingdom. We can’t resist quoting Greg Boyd on this subject again:

> We tend to assume that our life is still currently surrendered to Christ because we once-upon-a-time pledged to surrender it to Christ— which is why we tend to live largely secular lives, despite our confession of Christ as Lord. We have theoretically surrendered to the Kingdom, but the majority of our actual life is lived outside the Kingdom.¹¹

When adventure informs our activities and mission organizes the other functions of the church, those other functions are enhanced, not diminished. As we’ve already pointed out, community is formed more richly and deeply when forged in the crucible of missional activity. But likewise, discipleship—the formation of individuals more and more into the likeness of Christ—occurs with greater effectiveness when organized by liminality and mission. That is because the missional imperative demands that we die each day, that we live the life we pledge for a purpose beyond ourselves.

People resist mission because they are under-discipled, but they are also under-discipled because of the absence of any missional challenge. We seriously question whether Christians today need more teaching and training before being sent into mission. The memberships of most of our churches are full to bursting with Bible teaching. The reason it seems that they haven’t retained much of it is because they have never had to utilize it in a missional context. We say, take people into mission, confront them with the risk of godly service, and we guarantee they will be desperate for a biblical perspective on life.

## The Removal of Risk in Contemporary Society

But there’s more to understanding the nature of risk than the exploration of loss aversion. The remarkable story of risk hasn’t been fully told until we include some discussion of the sociological dimension. The preeminent sociologist in this field is the Munich-based Ulrich Beck, whose 1986 work, *Risk Society*, is a standard text on the subject.

Like Bernstein, Beck thinks our current understanding of risk is a distinctly modern phenomenon, but for a different reason. He suggests that the postindustrial society views risk differently than the preindustrial world. In a preindustrial world, the fate of society is shaped by naturally occurring hazards like disease, flood, famine, and the like, along with socially determined hazards such as invasion and conquest, regressive forms of thought and culture, and rigid class structures. But today, our fate is increasingly bound up with risks that are deliberately undertaken—for the sake of benefits conceived in advance—by means of our technological mastery over nature. In other words, the risks we chance today are not assessed by the probability that some force beyond our control might turn against us, but by an assessment of the risks posed by our own technological activity in the world. Beck says,

> In contrast to all earlier epochs (including industrial society), the risk society is characterized essentially by a lack: the impossibility of an external attribution of hazards. In other words, risks depend on decisions, they are industrially produced and in this sense politically reflexive.¹²

He takes this position so far as to actually define risk as “a systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by modernization itself.”¹³ In effect, Beck is writing a diatribe against risk management as practiced by so many risk experts, namely, as an exercise in bureaucratic rationality, technocracy, and contempt for the public perception of risk. The English call this kind of bureaucratic risk management the “Nanny State,” a society wherein every perceived risk is considered ahead of time, and legal provisions are made to minimize potential harm. Beck’s point is that it is the state-based and funded technologies that create the risks in the first place, and then they remove our capacity to assess them by enacting laws restricting them. In other words, there is both the increasing and the removal of risk at the same time: a risk society, to refer to the title of his book.

Rudy Rasmus is the unconventional pastor of St. John’s Downtown, a predominantly black church where a third of the members are either homeless or recently homeless. His work at St. John’s has been to awaken the spirits of the forgotten people of Houston: the jobless, the impoverished, and the addicted. In an old Methodist church building under a freeway overpass, thousands each week are offered hot showers and nourishing meals. There is an AIDS clinic and a youth center. Every day, the sprawling facilities at St. John’s are full of people who suffer from mental illness, drug addictions, and AIDS.

While visiting a large Presbyterian Church in the suburbs of Houston, Rudy was surprised to see a plaque on a number of the doors in the children’s ministry facility that read, “This is a Peanut Free Room.” A peanut free room? Rudy couldn’t figure out why these rich white folks would have peanut-free rooms, and when he asked the minister about this, he was told that many of the kids in that church suffered from allergies to peanuts, so the signs were there to assure parents that their children would be safe from any peanut products. This was too much for Rudy. He burst into fits of laughter. “In my church, we need gun free rooms, and syringe free rooms, and violence free rooms, but out here in the suburbs their biggest fear is peanuts!!”

This isn’t to disregard the very real allergic reactions some children have to the consumption of peanuts, but it does illustrate Beck’s point. The greatest fears we hold are often induced by human activity on the environment, and we now have warning signs and legal impediments for the most innocuous, everyday behavior.

In his book *The Barbarian Way*, Erwin McManus recounts the story of his son climbing onto the roof of their home, a stunt that McManus himself admits was the very thing he and his brother would have done when they were young:

> Early one evening, Kim and I were in the front yard when all of a sudden we heard a little voice calling for us from the roof. As soon as Kim saw him her nurturing instinct kicked in and she started commanding him to get back inside. I have to admit I was kind of proud of him right then, but what he did next totally surprised me. Looking past his mom, he asked if he could jump.¹⁴

Much to Kim’s shock, Erwin encouraged his young son to jump off the roof. He continues,

> For Aaron, the jump was fraught with danger. From my vantage point, I could see, though the jump was terrifying, he would find himself triumphant. It was important that he jumped and perhaps even more important that he knew me as the kind of father who would always call him to greater endeavors rather than sending him back to the safe place.¹⁵

Some readers over a certain age will remember billycart racing, rock fights, tree climbing, jumping off roofs and other activities almost completely banned these days. Those were the days. Nowadays we raise our children in a cocoon of domesticated security, far from any sense of risk or adventure. And where we ourselves can’t reach, the state legislates for safety. Perhaps nowhere is this obsessive risk-averseness more obvious than with those raised in the cottonwoolen safety of the church. They aren’t permitted to jump off the roof, or try a cigarette, or smash the windows in a derelict house, so when they reach young adulthood, they fly far from their faith in search of the adventure and excitement that was missing in their childhoods. And yet the bitter irony is that the Christian faith was birthed by men and women with an appetite for risk, and a daring belief in the supreme adventure of Christian mission. Leading young Christians into an even more daring risk than window-smashing or tree-climbing is absolutely essential, and we believe that the liminal adventure of mission is exactly that risk. But it requires godly, compassionate, and strategic leadership.

Many churches are discipling their young people in a hermetically sealed religious environment, attempting to keep the risks of “the world” at bay. It’s like keeping tropical fish in an aquarium—so much time and energy goes into keeping the water temperature at the right level, adjusting the Ph levels, cleaning the tank, etc. Used to such an artificial environment, your typical aquarium fish are fragile creatures, completely unable to survive in the ocean. We hate to break it to you, but if you flush the fish from your aquarium down the toilet, they will not end up swimming free on the wild currents of the sea á la *Finding Nemo*. In a sense, when we raise Christian kids in the aquarium-like environment of church culture, we shouldn’t be surprised when they so quickly abandon their faith after they leave home or go to college. We think that raising risk-taking missional kids will go a good deal of the way toward preparing them for life in the wide boundless sea.

## Leadership and the Risk-Averse

We don’t just need fathers who call us to risk and adventure, but church leaders who will do so as well. To return to the authors of *Surfing the Edge of Chaos*, we need to remember that equilibrium is death.

Not unlike a short-term mission, where liminality prevails and mission drives the agenda, a church planting team experiences the joy of communitas as well. Most churches start out with dynamic and exciting adventures in evangelism and mission, but like all living things there is movement from the early disequilibrium to a more stable environment of equilibrium. The early days of most churches are unpredictable and wild, but at the same time seem to be filled with a kind of spiritual energy. Why is this the case? What is it about disequilibrium that seems to stimulate life and energy? And what is it about stability that seems to stifle it? Is it because life itself is unpredictable and chaotic, and when we establish organizations that seek to control and minimize the dangers of life, these very organizations actually stifle life? The history of missions is quite clear about this: Christianity is at its very best when it is on the more chaotic fringes. The assertion that “equilibrium is death” is a derivative of an obscure but important law of cybernetics called the Law of Requisite Variety. This law states that “the survival of any organism depends on its capacity to cultivate (not just tolerate) variety in its internal structure. Failure to do so results in an inability to cope successfully with ‘variety’ when it is introduced from an external source.”¹⁶ To return to our earlier example of tropical fish tanks, the authors give us a great example as to how this law works in reality. They note,

> Fish in a bowl can swim, breed, get food with minimal effort, and remain safe from predators. But, as aquarium owners know, such fish are excruciatingly sensitive to even the slightest disturbances in the fishbowl. On the other hand, fish in the sea have to work much harder to sustain themselves and they are subjected to many threats. But because they cope with more variation, they are more robust when faced with a challenge.¹⁷

But we know from nature that survival favors heightened adrenaline levels, wariness, and experimentation. Or to put it more succinctly: history favors the brave. This is the reason we previously asserted that the main stimulus for the renewal of Christianity will come from the bottom and from the edge, from the sectors of the Christian world that are on the margins.¹⁸ Following the patterns of all living systems, church history teaches us that movements of adventurous mission in turn generate movements of spiritual renewal in the broader life of the church.

As we’ve already stated, liminal leadership is the crucial issue here. Leaders are to a social system what a properly shaped lens is to light. A leader focuses the capacities of the organization. Good leaders resist the internal or systemic urge for stability. In fact, they must be prepared to disturb the organization to break the tendency toward equilibrium that threatens to overwhelm it. But this is not achieved quickly, nor without significant wisdom as to human motivations and as to how human communities are activated in a new search for answers. Adaptive leaders must resist the urge to move too quickly or reach for quick fixes or prepackaged solutions. Rather they must activate a corporate search from deep within the ranks of the organization in order to help plot a way forward. This adaptive activation is achieved by:

- Communicating the urgency of the adaptive challenge (i.e., the threat of death or the promise of opportunity);
- Establishing a broad understanding of the circumstances creating the problem, to clarify why traditional solutions won’t work; and
- Holding the stress in play until “guerrilla” leaders come forward with innovative solutions.¹⁹

This sequence of activities will obviously generate significant anxiety and tension in the organization, but we had better get used to it if we are going to adapt to the rapidly changing environment of the twenty-first century. One of the skills of adaptive church leadership is to learn to manage the stress and make it a stimulus for innovation in church and mission. The Christian church ought to be highly responsive to its cultural and social contexts. We call this missional muscle, and it is in the constant pursuit of this fitness, or innate adaptability, that the church learns to adjust and respond to the challenges we face in our world. This is definitely part of what it means to be missional: only when the church is truly missional will it become highly sensitive to its environment and develop a natural, inbuilt, and theologically funded mechanism for triggering adaptive responses.

A missional church is therefore a genuine learning organization.

It was by being missionally fit that the church in the apostolic and post-apostolic periods not only survived but thrived. They were forced by sheer external conditions to live by their message and adapt to threats as they came along. This made them far more vigorous Christians than their more stable brothers and sisters in more static periods. They did not live in an artificial environment of a churchy fishbowl, but were the ecclesia in all the dangerous spheres of life. And just like our own immune system, what didn’t kill them served to make them stronger.

## Risk-Taking and the Dangers of Individualism

The other interesting aspect that Ulrich Beck brings to this discussion is how he sees the growth of individualization in society affecting our capacity for risk assessment. He points out that today individuals are freed from any unself-conscious immersion in traditional group decision-making and have to come to terms with their now-unmediated relation to society. Rather than judging the potential of any particular risk as a society or even as a group, we either make these determinations alone or they are made for us by legislators. The end result is that we are developing a society of individuals almost completely unable to measure or embrace risk in a constructive communal fashion. Our legislators tell us that we must wear a seatbelt in our motorcar, that we cannot smoke cigarettes in a restaurant, and that we cannot carry over 100ml of liquid on an airplane. And yet it was human technology that gave us motorcars, cigarettes, airplanes, and explosives in the first place. Our sense of risk is now centrally located around managing the dangers inherent in technology, and our capacity to address them has been taken out of our hands by the state.

Likewise, in churches where a conventional understanding of leadership has prevailed, there is a capitulation to the idea that clergy must act like chief executive officers. The members are rarely consulted, and any missional potential they might hold is simply overlooked. In the end, the clergy think it is their job to make the whole ecclesial machine perform—if they can figure out the best course of action, communicate it down to the troops, and then measure the results, they’ll have a high-performance church. But the result is that they often overreach their authority and suppress their people in the process. Which means they end up optimizing their performance within smaller and smaller parameters, so that when the world changes, they have less and less diversity and creativity with which to respond. If only they took New Testament ecclesiology more seriously. Paul assumes that the missional challenges, and their corresponding risks, undertaken by churches will necessarily assume the concerted effort of all the creativity and godliness present within the church. This is why he sees the church as a body, an organism, not an organization.

Those church leaders who embrace the old top-down sergeant-major approach think they’re producing tough churches. But they’re really producing churches that are less adaptable to change, because they are ignoring the communal missional potential within their church. And they are reinforcing their members’ assumption that risk is a bad thing and not for the fainthearted.

And yet, American sociologist Stephen Lyng has illuminated the importance and value of risk-taking behavior, particularly that performed by groups. His concept of edgework, described in the book of the same name, is sociology at the edge, the place where norms are renegotiated and boundaries contested. For Lyng and his coauthors, group-based risk-taking (or edgework) is an essential and energizing element of all societies. Or, at least, it should be. Rejecting the usual description of risk-taking activity as frivolous or indulgent, Lyng redeems the idea, seeing edgework as a renewing force in our society. He says,

> Risk-taking experience can be understood as either a radical form of escape from the institutional routines of contemporary life ... or an especially pure expression of the central institutional and cultural imperatives of the emerging social order.²⁰

In other words, when we look to our risk-takers we ought to see the shape of things to come rather than a mere rejection of the things that are. He continues:

> Edgework is seen as a means of freeing oneself from social conditions that deaden or deform the human spirit through overwhelming social regulation and control. In the other perspective, edgework valorizes risk-taking propensities and skills in demand throughout the institutional structures of the risk society. Thus, in one view, edgeworkers seek to escape institutional constraints that have become intolerable; in the other, edgeworkers strive to better integrate themselves into the existing institutional environment. These two ways of thinking about edgework seem mutually exclusive and contradictory, but then again, perhaps they are not. We must at least consider the possibility that people may, on one level, seek a risk-taking experience of personal determination and transcendence in an environment of social overregulation, whereas on another level they employ the human capital created by this experience to navigate the challenges of the risk society.²¹

So, at one level, risk-takers’ behavior is instrumental, and at another it is a natural, organic reaction to the institution. Lyng provides a sociological framework for validating the function of risk-takers, for taking notice of their behavior and questioning what it says to us about human nature and about the institution.

But usually, the institution rejects their behavior out of hand, seeing it as having no substantive contribution at all. This reminds us of the mainstream church’s reaction to what is now referred to as the emerging church. As numbers of emerging church leaders began to risk with new forms of worship, new approaches to leadership and, yes, new theological paradigms, the mainstream church reacted with outrage and even fury. Very few conservative mainstream leaders were even willing to countenance the possibility that the emerging church had anything of value to say or any meaningful critique of the existing church worth listening to. It was labeled “liberal” or “reactionary,” and we were told it was merely an example of the hypercritical nature of postmodernity. To repeat Stephen Lyng’s advice, “We must at least consider the possibility that people may, on one level, seek a risk-taking experience of personal determination and transcendence in an environment of social overregulation.”²² When the church overregulates, there should be no surprise when either risky movements like the emerging church appear, or when individuals abandon the church to embrace the risk of non-institutional Christianity.

More than affirming the role of the risk-takers in society, Lyng reflects on the kind of community they generate precisely because of their collective rebellion. Without actually employing the term communitas, he pretty much describes the same phenomenon when referring to group risk taking. He claims that groups organized around risk taking and adventure activities provide a refuge or a pathway or vehicle of expression for those confronting a formal institutional environment that does not fully meet their needs. When society does not allow the freedom or space for adventure and risky enterprises, risk-takers will find community and support with each other in their collective activity.²³ But what would happen if society was prepared to value their behavior and listen to their “message”? What if the comradeship, succor, and support was available within the institution against which they are rebelling? We need leaders in our churches who are able to model a big-hearted, thick-skinned kind of spirituality that doesn’t reject the rebels in their midst, but listens, discerns, and validates their legitimate and important perspective. They are given to the church as much as the nurturers and systematizers have been. After all, the church has everything it needs to get the job done.

Nothing has to be imported, for God has provided the very resources it needs to fulfill its distinctive calling, including the risk-takers, the rebels, and the prophets. The trick is to recognize that this capacity, these dormant potentials, are dispersed throughout the body of Christ and not located simply in its leaders. The individualism of our day stymies our capacity for risk, but the New Testament writers knew long ago that no one leader or small group of leaders was to have all the answers. Leadership looks to unleash the missional capacities in the people of God. Living systems theory generally teaches us that leaders should disturb, but not direct, their organizations. This means that leaders have to remember that in living systems, things happen that you can’t predict, and once they do, those events can set off avalanches with consequences that you could never imagine. You can disturb a church by embracing the risk of taking it into a liminal space and remaining there until the God-given potentials of the people are accessed.

Business guru Richard Pascale and his coauthors suggest three guidelines that will help disturb missional churches: design, don’t engineer; discover, don’t dictate; decipher, don’t presuppose.

### Design, Don’t Engineer

Too much standard church ministry is an attempt to socially engineer certain behaviors or outcomes. It is manipulative and often marginalizes the most creative people in our midst. Instead, leaders should cultivate environments where certain behaviors are stimulated rather than engineer outcomes. In this respect we need to see leadership through the metaphors of the gardener or the midwife rather than that of the CEO or the sergeant-major. Gardeners don’t actually produce fruit or flowers. They take seeds, packed full of the latent potential to become a tree or a shrub, and they control the environment to unleash that potential. By tending the garden, watering the plants, adding nutrients, pruning, and protecting, a gardener allows the seed to become what it was created to become. Likewise, a midwife doesn’t actually give birth. He or she manages the environment to allow a pregnant woman to successfully birth her child, to bring forth that which she has the innate capacity to deliver.

Missional leadership isn’t about social engineering or barking orders to compliant underlings. If there is any manipulation involved, it is about manipulating the environment to unleash the congregation’s latent missional potential—its apostolic risk-takers, its prophets, and its pastors.

To illustrate, think about airport gate lounges and the uniform nature of airport etiquette. There is a very obvious, yet unspoken, etiquette in airport lounges. There’s no yelling and screaming, even when passengers become frustrated with airline service. No one even talks loudly. There is a quiet order to the environment. But none of this behavior is enforced by signs that say “Don’t talk too loudly,” “Don’t move the chairs,” “Don’t occupy more than one seat.” According to Pascale and his coauthors, those things don’t happen due to an invisible hand of design. The environment has been manipulated to elicit certain behavior. The seats are arranged so that people talk to those who are close and they don’t shout across the room. The armrests are fixed, so you don’t see people sprawling across a couple of chairs. The seats are heavy and bolted down, so you can’t pick them up and rearrange them. It looks like it just happens, but the architect has evolved design principles that elicit certain behaviors, without telling people explicitly how to behave. Factoring liminality, adventure, risk taking, and mission into the church acts like a form of design. By designing them into the ecclesiology itself, we can create an implicit cultural expectation—we can forgo using guilt and heavy-handed rules to coerce the behavior of members. Instead of putting signs up everywhere that say “Take risks, be innovative,” adaptive leaders will simply expect that risk taking is part of discipleship and part of the design of the church, and innovation and mission will become a natural and obvious response to the conditions in which the congregation finds itself.

### Discover, Don’t Dictate

Second, as the organization undertakes the challenges set before it, there will be second- and third-order effects—the unpredictable things that need to be addressed but which could never have been anticipated. Their advice to leaders is to adopt a posture of discovery, or of openness to these unfolding challenges. Too many leaders want to dictate the outcomes and force the organization through their predetermined processes. It’s important to recognize that leadership can’t dictate an outcome. And just as important, once outcomes start to emerge, leaders can’t dictate the fastest solution everywhere. This leads to their third maxim.

### Decipher, Don’t Presuppose

As these second- and third-order effects emerge, good adaptive leaders resist their inclination to impose their solutions. Often leaders feel tempted to do so because it feels like the most efficient way of addressing obstacles. But Pascale et al. say that leaders need to recognize there is greater wisdom in the organization itself. How much more can we as Christian leaders acknowledge this in light of Paul’s teaching on the giftedness of all believers and the role of the Holy Spirit in the midst of the church? Leaders who want to impose predigested solutions on a church too quickly dampen the inherent wisdom present in the whole community. The trick is to create a design that allows a community to face issues squarely, to learn from itself, to come up with its own solutions to its problems. Or in the case of the church, God’s solution mediated by the Holy Spirit through the giftings of the members. Such a process will take longer than the imposition of the leader’s solution, but in the long run it will prove to be more efficient, because the wisdom of the collective will be adopted more enthusiastically than that imposed by the leader.

This reminds us of General Electric’s well-known Hawthorn Effect. Some years ago, GE did an extensive review of their Hawthorn plant because of its low level of productivity. After a lengthy consultation process with all the workers and management of the plant, the leadership at GE presented a series of recommendations to increase production at Hawthorn. One of these recommendations was to adjust the lighting on the factory floor. The workers had mentioned how the harsh fluorescent lighting made the factory an unpleasant working environment (ironic, given this was a GE plant). After the recommendations were adopted at Hawthorn, productivity went through the roof. It went from being one of the poorest performing plants to one of the most productive. Thrilled with this transformation, GE decided to implement a number of the Hawthorn ideas in other plants, including the replacement of their harsh lights with more ambient lighting. And yet this innovation had little or no effect on productivity in other factories. The Hawthorn Effect tells us that locally developed and owned solutions have far greater effect than those imposed by external experts. The General Electric management had presupposed something of the other factories, based on the experience at Hawthorn.

Similarly, too many church consultants and denominational leaders assume they can distill certain solutions and dictate them to all churches under their influence. Taking the risk of leading a community of believers into mission and then daring to believe that in such a chaotic environment new solutions will emerge from within the community itself is often a step too far for many church leaders. But we are convinced that embracing such a risk is essential. If we can embrace the adventure and risk and equip our churches to lay down their lives and abandon their inherent loss-aversion, who knows what innovation, what freshness, what new insights from the Spirit will emerge. If only we would take the risk!
