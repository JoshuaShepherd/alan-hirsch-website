# Chapter 2: Jesus Is My Disequilibrium

## Where Friends Become Comrades

Simply being alone can make us feel vulnerable. Being alone can make it difficult to put danger and fear into perspective. Without the presence of others to balance our perspectives, to strengthen our resolve, and to share our risks, living courageously can feel like a daunting task.

—Scott Bader-Saye

All for one and one for all!

—The Three Musketeers

Humans are inherently social creatures, and as such we learn to be courageous pretty much the way we learn everything else—by being with, observing, and modeling other people. The qualities we need to be good are shaped by sharing a life together with other people who help us to become good. As theologian Scott Bader-Saye contends,

> Virtues are learned by being with others who embody the virtues. We learn to be virtuous by seeing virtuous people act in virtuous ways. Lacking the community in which the virtues are being sought and lived, one would be hard pressed to develop any of the virtues, including courage.¹

But the contemporary church, by not being a place of courage and adventure, perpetuates a moral anxiety that fosters an awkwardness toward its wider community. Many church folk, in their self-conscious attempt to be overtly morally upright, emit all the wrong signals, thus messing with people’s perception of the gospel. Says Alison Morgan in *The Wild Gospel*:

> Anxiety ... means that insofar as we do engage with the world out there, our contribution is mostly a worried attempt to restrain it; afraid for our children, we strive to uphold the moral standards of a sliding culture by campaigning against abortion or disapproving of stories about wizards. The result is that we keep our moral and spiritual integrity, but our witness is lost.²

Such timidity and anxiety leaves the church as a retreatist, frightened, ineffective organization. Morgan goes on: “We have set up private clubs for those whose leisure interest is religion.”³ Church folk settle into patterns of institutional life that turn the focus inward, and become content with self-preservation. When churches displace mission for maintenance, they become unlikely places for individuals to develop a more adventurous form of discipleship, “since the temptation to self-preservation so quickly shuts down any courageous action.”⁴

This is why we must learn from great missional movements—especially the ones that suffered for their cause—because “they embodied the most powerful witness to courage we can imagine,” as Bader-Saye puts it.

> [The martyrs] recognized that discipleship would require risk, but they did not step back from it. They lived for something bigger than self-preservation, so the threat of death could not scare them into unfaithfulness. They were sustained by communities that not only taught them courage, but promised to tell their stories to future generations, assuring them that their sacrifice would not be forgotten. The courage of the martyr relies upon the courage of the community that dares to keep the martyr’s story alive. Today more than ever, our churches need to be telling and celebrating their stories.⁵

## Communit-eh?

We were always meant to venture out, but we were never meant to do it alone. When Jesus kicked off the mission that we are continuing now, he didn’t commission rugged, individualistic swashbucklers haphazardly forging their own destinies in life, but rather he initiated a movement destined to be the community of the faithful who are in the end found worthy to worship before the throne (Rev. 21). It is a widely recognized fact that Westerners tend to distort Jesus’s intent by reading the Bible as written to, and about, individuals. Not so. The Bible is written to communities, be it Israel or the church, and it is written to foster community, whether it be the national identity of Israel or the faith community of the church. Just as there is no such thing as an Israel-less Jew, there is no such thing as a churchless Christian (1 Cor. 12:13). Our very identity as God’s people is bound up in the collective identity of being an *ecclesia*—a group of people called, named, redeemed, ruled, and loved by Jesus (Rom. 1:1–3; Eph. 4; Col. 1:1–3; 1 Peter 2:9–10; Rev. 1–3). We are never going to be the church that Jesus built if we do not take community seriously.

In *The Forgotten Ways* Alan suggests that missional movements that actually transform their world comprised a dynamic network of communities that overcome their innate human instinct to “huddle and cuddle” and form themselves around a common mission that calls them onto a dangerous journey to unknown places. Movements happen when the church manages to shake off its collective fears and plunges into the mission of God in the world, where, while experiencing liminality and disorientation, they also get to encounter God and each other in a new way. Similarly, in *Exiles*, Michael explores the relationship of discipleship and community in calling us to live as exiles—followers of Jesus who operate from the margins of culture and, because of liminal circumstance, are recovering a much more biblical form of community. Either way, we were trying to describe the kind of community that is able to integrate adventure and movement, a community that experiences a togetherness that only happens among people inspired by the vision of a better world and attempting to do something about it. The name we gave to the communal phenomenon that forms in adventurous mission and liminal discipleship is *communitas*.⁶

Allow us to briefly reintroduce the term here. The best way to think about it is to imagine the kind of band of companions that form in the context of adventure, around a common ordeal, a challenge, a task, or in pursuit of a mission. This entry into a verge-like experience is called liminality. Liminality, remember, involves adventure, risk, journey, engagement, and courage and was explored as the subject of the previous chapter. When liminality “happens” (it can be deliberately cultivated), it fundamentally restructures the nature of preexisting relationships, friendships emerge from mere associations, and comradeship evolves from preexisting friendships. Being immersed in a communitas, participants experience an almost mystical togetherness that only occurs among a group of people engaging in a task bigger than itself. A different genre of love emerges from the experience of communitas—one that cannot emerge in the more static form of associations. The bonding is deep; people get to need each other, they get to know and rely on each other. They have to (sometimes for sheer survival), to overcome the liminal challenge in whatever form it is experienced.

Keep in mind that there is a direct and indissoluble link between liminality and communitas; they are two sides of the same coin. Unfortunately, we can’t have the one without the other. Therefore we will often join the two terms (liminality-communitas) to ensure that we appreciate the necessary dialectic inherent between the two aspects.

We cannot shake the impression that the church Jesus built was meant to experience this form of togetherness ... and lots of it. And not just for the sake of love and fellowship, but because we have a mission that requires it! Mission propels us out of self-concern to other-concern, from holy huddle to venturing out into God’s world. And mission, encapsulating as it does the purpose of the church, has always been vital to the equation of *ecclesia* that Jesus intended in the first place—it goes to the reason of why we exist at all! Much more is gathered up in this topic than we might first imagine.

## Dr. Turner, I Presume ...

We have adopted the terms liminality and communitas from the seminal writings of Victor Turner, an anthropologist who spent much of his life studying the various rites of passage among African people groups, particularly the Ndembu of southern Africa.⁷ He used the term liminality to describe a transition process accompanying a fundamental change of state or social position. He particularly focused on the initiation ceremonies where boys are transitioned into being men. These situations of liminality constitute a kind of test about whether the participants will be allowed to return to society and to transition to the next level in the prevailing social structure. Cast out of the village and made to live in the jungle, fending for themselves and being visited regularly by the community holy men to be taught the lore and learning of adulthood, the initiates find themselves on this threshold. Liminality therefore applies to that situation where people find themselves in an in-between, marginal state in relation to the surrounding society, a place that could involve significant marginalization, ordeal, disorientation, and sometimes danger.

For example, in some tribes, younger boys are kept under the care of the women until initiation age—around thirteen. At the appropriate time, the men sneak into the female compound of the village at night and “kidnap” the lads. The boys are blindfolded, roughed up, and herded out of the village into the bush. They are circumcised, then left to fend for themselves in the wild African bush for up to six months. They are in a threshold experience. Once a month the elders of the tribe go to meet them to help debrief and mentor them. But on the whole they have to find both inner and outer resources to cope with the ordeal without any outside assistance.

During this time, the initiates move from being disoriented and individualistic to developing a deep bond of comradeship forged in the testing conditions of liminality. Turner observed that during the period of liminality, the initiates progressively achieve a release from conformity to general norms and experience a profound and collective sentiment for each other—a “super community,” a transforming experience of connection with oneself, with others, and with the universe. Thought by Turner to most approximate a religious experience, he called this wonderful experience of interconnectedness between initiates *communitas*. Communitas in his view happens in situations where individuals are driven to find each other through a common experience of ordeal, humbling, transition, and marginalization. It involves intense feelings of social togetherness and belonging brought about by having to rely on each other in order to survive. If the boys emerge from these experiences, they are reintroduced into the tribe as men. They are thus accorded the full status of manhood—they are no longer considered boys.

In the context of a shared ordeal, the boys find each other in new ways. They experience newfound “comradeship.”

We were recently given a marvelous illustration of the liminality-communitas in the blockbuster movie *Avatar*, where the story’s protagonist, Jake Sully, with the guidance of his sponsor, Neytiri, and under the harsh tutelage of the established warriors, is initiated into the adult Na’vi culture. Through the process, he is not only initiated into the people’s life philosophy and story, he is called to embark (with the other young initiates) on a sometimes death-defying process of learning to be a true warrior worthy of the people. The movie, like many of its type, is mythic in structure and simply draws on the use of collective memories and on what we already know about how societies transfer cultural vigor and identity through rituals of liminality-communitas.

Far from being damaging to social structures, regular experiences of communitas strengthen a society. While societies need the stability of normal life, they also need the liminal experience of communitas. This is what pushes society forward, infusing it with a freshness and vitality that comes from the deeper communion created by the threshold experience. It is the almost mystical sense of comradeship experienced in communitas that sows the seeds of cultural regeneration back in normal society. These bonds deepen relationships and enrich the community for life.

Turner went so far as to detach the phenomena of liminality and communitas from rites of passage; he suggested that it is possible for societies to experience them regularly, not just at early adulthood. The social modes of normal society (structure) and communitas (what he calls anti-structure) can and do exist simultaneously in a society, and no society can function adequately without this dialectic.⁸ In fact, the loss of meaningful rituals of initiation into adulthood is considered by some to be the main cause of delinquency and malformed adult identity, particularly amongst men, in the West.⁹ This at least partly explains young urban kids’ desire to join the many gangs populating the inner cities. Turner dared to suggest that in the dialectic between communitas and normal society lies the hope for the future of that society.

> People or societies in a liminal phase are a kind of institutional capsule or pocket which contains the germ of future social developments, of societal change.¹⁰

This is so different from what we have usually identified as community, particularly the way the church has used this term. So-called Christian community is often portrayed as an inwardly focused gathering of people, committed to worshiping God together, to regular attendance at Sunday worship and small groups, to Bible study, and to encouraging and building each other up. There is very little that can be called liminal in the average American churchgoer’s experience of Christianity. Certainly churches should be “safe places” where members can be open and vulnerable together, receive support, understanding, and pastoral care. We have no objection to these things, but perhaps that is only part of the story, and they have become ends in themselves. The safety-obsessed church lacks the inner dynamic to foster profound missional impact in our time. But thankfully all the potential for real communitas lies dormant in them. All it takes is a little adventure to activate it in order for them to once again become the revolutionary movement that God intended for the world.

## Communion, Up in the Air

In their research into the nature of high-risk leisure activities, Richard Celsi, Randall Rose, and Thomas Leigh examined the experience of a number of skydiving clubs in the United States. They found that skydivers experienced a kind of communal bliss, or communitas, just as Victor Turner described it. But more than that, skydiving clubs, due to the high-risk nature of their shared activity, were bonded in an extreme fashion. In other words, jumping is the “mission,” and it catalyzes an intense bond between fellow jumpers. It is quite literally a collective faith of leap.

Celsi, Rose, and Leigh were able to separate out a number of aspects to the communitas experienced by skydivers. They say that their subjects experienced “flow”—an individual heightened experience; communitas—transcendent group camaraderie; and what they call “phatic communion”—a special form of communication between participants. So perhaps by struggling with even more new and strange terminology, we believe that the bond skydivers experience together can help deepen our understanding of Christian communitas.

The authors found that their subjects described the skydiving act as one of total absorption that provides them not only with thrill and excitement, but also a sense of involvement that transcends mundane experience. In the midst of this complete absorption, they were in the “flow” and nothing else mattered. Celsi et al. take up the point:

> This transcendent state, or “flow experience” ... occurs when a situation demands total participation from the individual. As such, flow is a phenomenological state where self, self-awareness, behavior, and context form a unitized singular experience. Thus, flow is a state of total involvement where one moment “flows” holistically into the next without “conscious intervention.”¹¹

They quote sociologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who first coined the term flow, and who believed the flow experience is the manifestation of a person’s true self, unconstrained temporally by convention or by self-awareness.¹² In other words, flow provides a sense of self and self-efficacy that is highly satisfying and self-fulfilling. But flow could be experienced in any activity that requires high levels of concentration. Novelists report being “in the flow” as they write, as do musicians when they play. Celsi et al. discovered that when groups perform an activity that requires total absorption, this sense of flow arises in individuals, but it sets off a number of other responses, primarily communitas. This bond transcends everyday statuses and social roles, as Celsi et al. found among skydivers. They quote one of their subjects as saying,

> Jumpers have a special kind of bond. You have your doctors, professors, lawyers, but you also have your truck drivers, bricklayers, and masons. Out here on the weekends none of that is a factor. What people do and how much money they make just doesn’t matter. There’s just this closeness here.¹³

In keeping with Turner’s finding that liminality is the ordeal that catalyzes communitas, jumpers experience skydiving as a truly liminal state. Celsi et al. put it this way: “Each skydive itself, in microcosm, can be seen as a liminal state between two environmental statuses—physical contact with the earth, plane, or parachute versus free-fall. In this sense, a liminal experience is replicable to all skydivers with each jump.”¹⁴

From flow to shared flow, these skydivers then experience what has been termed a phatic communion. Coined by anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski, phatic communion refers to the special communication that occurs within cultural groups. This is the kind of “insider knowledge”—that knowing—that members of a sporting team seem to have with each other, where one player has a seemingly transcendent sense of where another player is going and what he or she is going to do next. The high-risk subculture of skydiving has the same mystical connection, a special communication that anticipates behavior as well as communicating shared experience and technical language. It is a special language that joins together members of the cultural community and is little understood by nonmembers. Indeed, comprehension of this special language is held in high esteem as a sign of cultural membership. It is more than the jargon or “in-words” used by some groups to exclude others. It is essential communication required by members to fulfill their contribution to the shared ritualistic experience, whether skydiving, playing football, or undertaking a missional adventure.

In Edward Zwick’s powerful World War II film, *Defiance*, we meet three Jewish brothers who are forced into hiding from the occupying Nazis in a nearby Belorussian forest. There they discover more Jews, also hiding, and band together to create a makeshift forest community with the hope of outlasting the war. As stories of this renegade community filter throughout the region, more refugees from Nazi oppression join them, and over time the brothers realize they need a more sophisticated approach to the collection of food and the building of shelter in order to survive the harsh Russian winter that looms. The small ragged band of refugees develops into a well-organized society, sheltering deep within the isolated Lipiczanska forest.

Director and screenwriter Zwick makes a point of not showing any of the war that rages on around the forest, keeping his camera firmly focused on the refugee community. He portrays the minutia of their society: wood collection, food preparation, the posting of sentries. Babies are born. Couples fall in love and are married. A rabbi conducts worship. The passage of time is discernible only by the changing seasons. This almost claustrophobic approach to storytelling helps to establish the intense level of relationship experienced by the characters, because even though some semblance of society is developed, we know that the forest community is a community under extreme pressure. Beyond the forest, the German forces begin to close the net on them.

*Defiance* was not a popular film, and the critics seemed perturbed by its length (137 minutes), the bleakness of the story, and its visual drabness (set almost entirely in a dark, snow-covered forest). But these are essential elements in the retelling of the Bielski brothers’ story. The unremittingly miserable conditions at Lipiczanska, the long tense hours of not knowing when the Nazis will attack, punctuated occasionally by bursts of violence and bloodshed, aren’t exactly the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters. But *Defiance* is a sensational depiction of communitas. Despite their differences, which are not inconsiderable, the three brothers—Tuvian, Zus, and Asael—are united by a common foe and a common mission. The forest society they fashion isn’t without internal conflict, but such conflict is dwarfed by the challenges they face together. These challenges—surviving winter, evading Nazis, foraging for food—form the basis of their mission, and it is this mission that shapes and sustains their community.

The same spirit experienced by skydivers—flow, communitas, phatic communion—is also evident in *Defiance*. And while skydivers create an artificial ordeal, the Bielskis had theirs thrust upon them. We acknowledge that these are dramatic examples of societies forged by the liminal experience of danger. But we suggest that it is possible for Christians to enter the liminality of mission and experience the same catalyzing effects on their sense of community.

## Liminality-Communitas by the Book

But liminality-communitas is not merely the scholarly concern of academic anthropologists and skydiving theorists. It is not only a common human experience but turns out to be a thoroughly biblical one, the recovery of which is vital to fostering a genuinely missional ecclesiology. In fact, when we examine Scripture with the liminality-communitas framework in mind, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the most theologically fertile sections are formed in times of precisely such situations.

As we have seen in chapter 1, the main clusters of revelation seem to come in times of extremity. And when we consider the biblical stories that have inspired the people of God throughout the ages, we find that they are stories involving adventures of the spirit in the context of challenge. In fact, that is exactly why they inspire.

### Actors in the Story

Take Abram (later Abraham), for instance, who with his entire extended family (estimated to be about seventy people and their belongings) is called by an invisible God to leave house and home and all that is familiar to undertake a very risky journey to a land that at that stage remained a mere promise by this God. And when we look at the various experiences they have along the way, stories that have shaped all subsequent faith (e.g., the offering of Isaac), they are not safe little bedtime stories. Rather they call us to a dangerous form of faithfulness that echoes the faithfulness of Abraham (Gal. 3:15ff; Heb. 11:8–13). Or when we explore the profoundly liminal Exodus experience, we find that this very tricky journey indelibly shaped the people of God and continues to do so to this very day. It was also the context of the substantial revelation of God in his covenant with his people. The same can be said of the exile into Babylon many centuries later—this was an extreme situation that changed the whole way Israel related to her God, and still does. The prophets spoke the Word of God into such contexts of extremity. And it was precisely when the people of God settled down and “forgot YHWH” (see Deut. 4:23–31) that they had to be spiritually disturbed once again by the prophets. To awaken the people to their lost calling, the Prophets recalled the dangerous memories about fires on the mountain and pursuing armies and a God who lovingly redeems a people and enters into a sacred and eternal covenant with them. This sounds pretty liminal to me.

As we consider the lives and ministries of Samuel, Elijah, Samson, and David and his band, and ask what conditions they encountered, and we come up with the consistent themes of liminality and communitas. And when we come to the New Testament, we need to look only to the life of Jesus, who had nowhere to rest or lay his head, and who discipled his followers on the road in the real, dangerous conditions of an occupied land and against a hostile and dodgy religious elite. So much so, that discipleship à la Jesus looks awfully like those risky initiation rites that the African kids have to go through. It was both costly (“deny yourself and follow me”) and dangerous (“if they hated me, they will hate you too”), but that came with the territory of discipleship.

To find these themes in abundance, look at the life of Paul. He describes it vividly for us in 2 Corinthians. Whippings, beatings, imprisonment, and shipwrecks can hardly be called “safe, secure, comfortable, and convenient.” Yet through these experiences, he and his apostolic band totally realign the course of history around the gospel of Jesus Christ. The book of Acts is so brimful with liminality-communitas that it reads like a rollicking adventure story. Communitas describes well the sense of companionship that the disciples must have felt. With Jesus leading the charge, they experienced a liminality and communitas so exquisite that it eventually altered the history of the world forever. While we sometimes mistakenly imagine the company of Christ to be a happy band of vagabonds traveling carefree around Judea, we need to remember that the Twelve, in particular, had left everything to follow Jesus. They were like the African initiates. They had separated themselves from the mainstream of their society at great personal cost. They are a perfect example of a liminal society that lies at the heart of our own defining Story.

### Strangers and Aliens

A particularly poignant way to conceive of ourselves as a communitas is to recover the biblical teaching that incorporates images of exile and pilgrimage. While the theme winds its way through all of Scripture, the book of Hebrews is the book *par excellence* for calling us to be an ongoing communitas ... or in the words of the writer, to be God’s pilgrim people who will faithfully testify, by their continuing status as exiles and strangers, to their desire for a better country, a heavenly city, a homeland (Heb. 11). By their very pilgrimage, they give witness that they are in fact already citizens of that community. Hebrews pictures the Christian community on earth as living like Abraham in tents “in the land of promise, as in a foreign land” (Heb. 11:9 RSV). The noted ecclesiologist Paul Minear asserts that “the church is by its very nature composed of tent dwellers.”¹⁵

In fact, all the books in the last third of the New Testament focus on the church as a pilgrim people. From Hebrews to Revelation we have a variation of this theme from different perspectives.¹⁶ New Testament scholar Scott Nash points us to a helpful illustration of this in the subtitle of John Bunyan’s classic *The Pilgrim’s Progress*. The extended title of the book, typical to nineteenth-century publishing, was unbelievably long ... [taking big breath] it says:

> The Pilgrim’s Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come, Delivered under the Similitude of a Dream, Wherein Is Discovered the Manner of His Setting Out, His Dangerous Journey, and Safe Arrival in the Desired Country.

The last part of his title suggests three dimensions of the pilgrim life useful for us to consider:

- The Manner of Setting Out,
- The Dangerous Journey, and
- The Safe Arrival in the Desired Country.

We have, then, a beginning, a middle, and an end to the adventure of pilgrimage.¹⁷

Significantly, these three dimensions of pilgrimage square well with the theme of the last eight books of the New Testament:

- The book of Hebrews, which appears first in this group, focuses on the beginning of the journey. While Hebrews deals with many subjects, its central theme is a call to lifelong pilgrimage and courage to continue in spite of the odds.
- The books of James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, and Jude all focus on the middle part, the journey itself and warnings about the dangers of being sidelined or getting off track.
- The last book in this group, Revelation, focuses on the end. It gives a grand vision of the final destination and offers encouragement for safe arrival in the desired country.¹⁸

Another aspect about the pilgrim imagery is worth mentioning: God’s chosen people are destined to be like spiritual vagabonds, refugees, exiles, and as such they are not able (or allowed) to blend in with the locals. They are different, they are strangers that exist in that limbo of exile where, as we have seen, authentic life transitions are accomplished. It is no accident that the Bible insists that believers identify with the poor, the mistreated, and the prisoners (e.g., Heb. 10:32–34; 13:2–3).

Taken together, these books and others (e.g., the Pentateuch, the Prophets, the Gospels, and Acts) teach us that the journey we are called to take is beset with difficulties. Fear and inertia may endanger the beginning. Pitfalls may lie along the trail threatening the journey itself. Some pitfalls may come from without in terms of wrong turns or dangerous terrain. Some pitfalls may come from within in terms of disagreement about directions or dissension among the travelers themselves. Even near the end, pilgrims may lose sight of the final destination or may despair of ever reaching it. Journeys worth making are seldom easy.¹⁹

## The Rhythm of Life

It turns out the concept of communitas isn’t as unusual as it first appears. It is not just embedded in our deepest theology, it is structured into the very rhythm of life itself. So, if it does appear odd to us, this is likely because we have somehow managed to remove ourselves from the challenging spiritual discipline found in liminality-communitas. Surely we can recall periods of our lives when this was true. Think of any group of people in a liminal state, and in all likelihood they will have experienced a deeper sense of community than those who have opted for a safe experience. From the New Yorkers’ experience of 9/11 to the deadlines at work, from surviving and reconstructing after a national disaster to playing in a sports game final, liminality-communitas is everywhere present. Heck, at the end of a weekend church camp, everyone has bonded and cries when it’s time to leave. If you have ever been on a short-term mission trip overseas, you have felt that special, intimate, profound sense of connection with your fellow travelers. People who experience a war together report that those who didn’t simply cannot know the comradeship people in extreme situations experience. Ever wondered why people join gangs? And why they will die for their “homies”? Communitas.

When building houses in Mexico or working in orphanages in Haiti, we connect with others at an entirely different level from that experienced each week in our local church. This isn’t just because of the exotic location or the spicy food. It’s because we are in a liminal state. We are not living at home, nor are we really living in Mexico. We are in transition, a resident in neither place, really. This sense of liminality, fueled by the challenge of completing certain set tasks, fosters communitas. Even if we find ourselves on a team with people we don’t particularly like or whose company we don’t much enjoy, the experience of liminality eventually sweeps away our petty differences, bonding us strongly, because we are forced to rely on each other for survival.

It’s disturbing to hear young people, recently returned from an experience of liminality and communitas, complain that their church not only doesn’t understand their experience, but provides no forums for them to talk about it. As noted earlier, Turner said that those who’ve tasted communitas are like a capsule that contains the germ of future development and change. We must learn to maximize on the renewal being offered by those who return from liminal journeys.

## All for One and One for All

Many people undergo something of a communitas experience in their daily lives. Sporting teams, theatre companies, orchestras, bands, dance troupes—these kinds of societies all know something, perhaps just a whiff, of the experience of communitas. When a group of musicians or dancers are performing, every member must play their part well—not just individually, but in concert with the others. This sense of interdependence can be very exciting. Jazz musicians will speak of the almost spiritual nirvana they sense when all members of the band are playing in perfect harmony. Any member of a sports team can recall something of the profound sense of intimacy they feel with their teammates, when each of their contributions to the game create a force greater than the sum of their individual parts. When an amateur theatre group begins rehearsals, it can be just a ragtag assembly of would-be thespians. But when onstage, galvanized by the threat of the impending opening night, they are transformed into something else. With the script as their guide, they are forced together by the “ordeal” of knowing they will soon be giving public performances. One young amateur actor once told one of us that he felt a greater sense of belonging and acceptance in his theatre company than in his church. We suppose he thought it had to do with the quality of the people in the theatre as compared with those in the church. But the fact remains that churches are full of marvelous, kind, caring people, every bit as accepting as theatre people. The fundamental difference is that churches are working on community, while an amateur theatre group is forming a kind of communitas.

Turner himself was onto this phenomenon. Later in his career he began to apply his theories to American subcultures like artists. In his essay *Liminality and Communitas*, he notes,

> Prophets and artists tend to be liminal and marginal people, “edgemen,” who strive with a passionate sincerity to rid themselves of the clichés associated with status incumbency and role-playing and to enter into vital relations with other men in fact or imagination.²⁰

He believed that artists, including actors, musicians, dancers, painters, and the like, were the very people most capable of propelling society forward, because they had stepped into a liminal state and had experienced a communitas unlike anything possible in normal society. If you’ve spent any time with artists of any kind, you’ll know what he means. When artists meet for the first time, they share the knowing smile of someone who has stepped out of the respectability of mainstream suburban life. Their shared liminality opens them up immediately to each other—although strangers, they are family.

## Putting It All on the Line

This is no different from men and women who have served together in the armed forces, particularly those who saw combat together. On Veterans Day we see them gathering for their street marches, nodding with an unspoken respect to each other. They have known a liminality unlike anything the rest of us can imagine. They were separated from mainstream society, sent to a foreign land to undergo a life-and-death ordeal, and then returned to us as different people. Those of us who have known nothing but civilian life can never fully appreciate their experience. It is to each other, to the communitas, that they must turn for real understanding.

This kind of battlefield camaraderie was described by the French knight, Jean de Brueil, in 1465:

> Battle is a joyous thing. We love each other so much in battle. If we see that our cause is just and our kinsmen fight boldly, tears come to our eyes. A sweet joy rises in our hearts, in the feeling of our honest loyalty to each other; and seeing our friend so bravely exposing his body to danger in order to fulfill the commandment of our Creator, we resolve to go forward and die or live with him on account of love. This brings such delight that anyone who has not felt it cannot say how wonderful it is. Do you think someone who feels this is afraid of death? Not in the least! He is so strengthened, so delighted, that he does not know where he is. Truly, he fears nothing in the world.²¹

Some might be squeamish about what seems like the glorification of war, but we don’t mean in any way to be lionizing the horrors of mortal combat. We are reminded by the horror of war, though, about the powerful connection that people develop when faced with awesome odds. It’s the same connection that explorers like Shackleton or Peary or Lewis and Clark felt with their men. The sense of communitas that Shackleton developed with his crew was legendary. He pledged them his life that he would not let one of them die, and when his Endurance expedition got into so much trouble, he traveled thousands of miles in an open boat and then traversed a mountainous island to get help for them, as they waited out a dreadful winter in an up-turned rowboat. In return his crew loved him beyond words. Communitas is not an exclusively male experience by any means.

In Cambodia, for instance, it is women who lead many of the effective trade unions, fighting for better work conditions for their colleagues. It is women’s groups that fight and lobby the government against the epidemic of domestic violence. A women’s media centre has been established to raise awareness of the unacceptable levels of rape that beset Cambodian families. During the recent national election, thousands of women were marshaled as independent observers at polling stations to scrutinize the vote-counting process. In Argentina in the 1970s, a group of white-scarved mothers assembled every week in Buenos Aires’ main square, under the glare of soldiers of the monstrous military dictatorship of General Videla, to display pictures of their missing children. Their children were numbered among the 30,000 *desaparecido*—literally, the disappeared—of that regime. Called the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo, these mothers banded together to remain the only people in the world to hold Videla’s henchmen accountable.

It’s the same connection that the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and her fiery daughters, Christabel and Sylvia, developed with their “troops” who fought against a society that wouldn’t grant women the vote. When one of their number, Emily Wilding Davison, threw herself under the king’s horse, Anmer, as it rounded Tattenham Corner in the 1913 English Derby, male society was shocked by the lengths to which these women would go. For the suffragettes, though, the movement was a war, and the communitas that developed was every bit as great as that between male combatants during military campaigns.

Similar groups have developed in Northern Ireland where both Catholic and Protestant mothers of murdered children have been at the forefront of peace and reconciliation movements. In the 1970s Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan, two bereaved Irish mothers, still grieving for the murders of their own sons and fed up with watching their friends’ sons and their nephews die on the streets, formed the Community of Peace People. Initially a women’s movement, it said “Enough!” to the never-ending cycle of violence and vengeance that gripped Northern Ireland. Ignored by the male-dominated political parties, the Peace People captured the hearts of thousands of ordinary Irish parents. When Williams and Corrigan were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their peace-building work in 1976, Irish politicians were forced to take them seriously.

Thrown together by their liminal state, forced to work against cultural forces massed against them, women’s groups around the world know the same kind of communitas that the thirteenth-century French knight Jean de Brueil spoke of earlier. Such communitas is hardened by battle, softened by true and genuine partnership, and forged by a shared vision for a better world.

Some of these stories describe highly intense and extremely risky activities. Are we suggesting that Christian communities could live permanently in this heightened state of awareness? Of course not. But we do think that Christian communities could develop so robust a commitment to serving others that it catalyzes a kind of phatic communion, albeit an everyday version. For a winsome, somewhat more down-to-earth example of this, we turn to an eccentric band of missionaries called The Winking Circle.

In Uxbridge, Ontario, you’ll find the most extraordinary communitas, committed to embracing what they call the everyday adventure. Watching their town become slowly absorbed by subdivisions of commuters, chain stores, and big box outlets, this group of friends rallied together to resist the prevailing apathy and launch a mini-revolution. Calling themselves The Winking Circle, they began as one family and a group of local kids who took over a condemned house and began a series of eccentric projects that marked them out against the rest of society.

They started by customizing a bunch of old bikes, welding them into the strangest flotilla of hand-painted choppers, tall bikes (up to five levels high), tireless bikes, low bikes, and all sorts of rolling art machines. Once they started cruising the streets of their sleepy little town on their moving bike sculptures, a spark was ignited and a communitas was forged. The Winking Circle had started a fire of eccentric self-expression, a holdout against the conformity and mind-numbing ordinariness of the lives of those around them. Soon others joined them in their everyday adventure.

When asked what they were doing, they replied that they had turned off their television sets and were starring in their own lives. And the weird bike project was only the beginning. They started to travel to a nearby city to take part in mass bike rides to alert others to their marvelous mission to eccentrify the world. They started bands, designed their own clothes, and screen-printed their T-shirts. They organized shows in halls, basements, and bedrooms. They invented ridiculous hairstyles and strange dance moves. BMX trails were dug in the woods near their town. They built bike and skate ramps and eventually worked with the local township to raise the money and construct their dream ramp—the “Tsunami ramp”—for all to enjoy.

And all along, they filmed all this eccentric activity with handicams to record the insanity for posterity. Eventually, a documentary filmmaker labored over the hundreds of hours of footage to create a video zine, *The Winking Circle*, an audiovisual celebration of everything the group stands for. Of this film, it is claimed,

> Everyone who sees it is impacted in their own way. Kids have been known to shut off the television immediately after watching it to draw or build bike jumps. Jaded television executives are moved to tears, people make their own Winking Circle T-shirts. It has been a springboard for people to remember old dreams and envision new ones. Numerous people have said that it permanently affected them and the way they think about their place in the world.²²

All this activity is undergirded and sustained by what The Winking Circle calls “the wisdom of the 3 Beans.” It forms the foundation of their community. In the documentary film, they describe the 3 Beans as follows:

- **Create everywhere:** We are creative, not spectators. We personally customize ourselves and our surroundings.
- **Be a fool:** We will not conform. We’re not cool. We make up dance moves and try crazy stunts.
- **Redeem everything:** Whether it’s a bad situation or a beat-up bicycle, we transform it into something spectacular.

Year after year, more and more young people have joined this community of eccentricity, making it a heroic, energetic, and inclusive underground youth movement. But it hasn’t all been smooth sailing for The Winking Circle. Like any good communitas, they have found that when you stand against conformity, apathy, and consumerism, the world fights back. Their first ramps were burnt to the ground by local vandals, and the replacements were continually attacked. Their dream ramp (the fabled Tsunami ramp) was, without any warning, sawn in half and secreted out of town. A national Canadian television program ran a short film produced by The Winking Circle, and took all the credit for it after the film won international awards. And most famously, a global beverage corporation allegedly ripped off the design of their video for one of their marketing campaigns. Furthermore, trying to sustain the wisdom of the 3 Beans among young people hasn’t been easy. As some of them grew older, the daily onslaught of consumer culture began to numb them into apathy. But overall, the effect has been positive. Many Winkers (as they call themselves) have become talented musicians and songwriters. A few bands have been formed, got recording contracts, and gone on tour. Two separate charities have been created: one selling handmade clothing and art to raise money for the poor; another collecting and repairing used bikes to send to Africa. A number of the Winkers have gone on mission trips all over the world to serve those in need. Artistic self-expression remains important for many of those involved. Art cars have been painted and driven. A few entrepreneurial spirits have started their own business. People are going on to study for careers in international development, art therapy, medicine, theatre, graphic design, and the music industry. As they say of themselves, they have been “ruined for the ordinary.”

The Winking Circle of Uxbridge, Ontario, is a perfect example of a communitas, a collective of people who find meaningful life together as a result of their shared mission.

## Embedding an Adventure Spirituality

If we are going to make the change from community to communitas, and not just end up with an unsustainable adrenaline-junkie culture, we must have a sophisticated process to form people into adventurer-disciples. In what follows, we have tried to be guided by what we know from the social sciences, theology, liturgiology, and to be honest, a good dose of educated guesswork. We suggest three points for inculcating an adventurous spirituality: embedding risk and adventure into the culture, developing a new hero-system, and ritualizing it into the community.

### Embed Adventure into the Culture

If we want to become an adventuring church, then liminality-communitas must become part of the very culture of the church/organization. Here are some suggestions about how to do this:

- **Take risks:** Wise risk-taking and courageous actions should be encouraged and ongoing. The organization should value experimentation, engage in church planting as often as possible, and get involved in missional activity that takes its members to the edges of what is comfortable or normal.
- **Form disciples in community:** While we appreciate individual effort and achievement, we need to foster the understanding that we are in this together. Private discovery of meaning is not enough. Meaning is discovered in community—it is a “tribe thing.” Beware of the naturally competitive nature of Westerners here: it should involve movement into space where ongoing transformation can continue, not competitive space where I must continue to define and prove myself. Remember, it is about becoming mature disciples of Jesus and not defining ourselves over against others.
- **Create positive and redemptive experiences:** Whatever events and processes we might use to cultivate liminality-communitas, they must involve initiation into something really transformational, good, and positive. Whatever ideas are transferred during liminality-communitas events, they should be saturated with the redeeming power of the gospel of Jesus and not an ideology against, in fear of, angry at, or needing to win over anybody else.
- **Start young and expect a lifelong journey:** Churches are especially advised to develop some form of ritual initiation process whereby children are initiated into the wise risk-taking that forms an essential part of mature discipleship. And don’t allow the adults, families, and older folk to think that adventure and risk is a thing of youth. That big cop-out must be avoided at all costs.
- **Create opportunity to adventure:** There need to be regular opportunities and events that people can get involved with. It cannot just be a once-a-year weekend high. It must somehow be structured into Christian life itself.
- **Do something together:** Adventure spirituality must therefore be action-based. Action should be at the heart of the culture. It cannot simply be reduced to a mental process of assimilating theology or the academic study of ethics. This requires the deliberate cultivation of, and rewarding of, courageous action in the life of the community. Everyone should be somehow, and sometimes, involved in adventuring out.
- **Cultivate genuine spiritual-moral authority:** You cannot lead where you will not go; you cannot teach what you do not know. You can only transfer what you already have. If the leaders have not gone through significant liminality-communitas experiences themselves, they really have nothing to say to those they lead. Leaders must lead by example. If not, any attempt by them to develop the culture of adventure and a hero system that incorporates liminality-communitas will result in mere parody and strained symbolization. And while certain events might still be appreciated, it will not fundamentally change the culture.
- **Tell lots of stories:** Tell stories of liminality-communitas and create ample opportunities for others to tell theirs. But also give meaning and interpretation to the stories through teaching from Scripture, social sciences, and history.

### Develop a Vibrant Hero System

Second, when seeking to inculcate an adventurous spirituality in your group, find heroes who embody such a spirituality. Any person’s or organization’s heroes tell us a lot about what they value. Heroes are myth-bearers and therefore transmitters of the meaning and belief. Traditionally, prophets, apostles, founders, saints, and martyrs are the church’s heroes of the faith. Here are some pointers to developing a vibrant hero system:

- **Develop a homegrown league of heroes:** In creating a culture of adventure, there has to be some collectively agreed-upon “hero system” that defines and symbolizes what is truly valued by the community.
- **Use many archetypes:** Our heroes must include more types than just those who are great at caring for others and/or those who can gather information and communicate well. Certainly these are forms of heroism, but we must broaden out to include the great “doers of the word,” spiritual revolutionaries, and other adventurers of the spirit.
- **Develop a working mythology:** Again the stories we tell ourselves embody our mythos. We should learn how to tell the stories of others in ways that develop the hero system of the organization.
- **Remember, as disciples our archetypal hero is Jesus; and in order to be authentically Christian, our everyday heroes should somehow reflect him.**

### Ritualize Liminality-Communitas

Never underestimate the power of ritual and symbol in the formation of culture. Sociologists are absolutely clear on this—these are not just useful, they are essential. Evangelicals need to recover the power of symbol and ritual in general, but in this specific instance we need to learn how to ritualize our experience of liminality and communitas in order to foster a more adventurous spirituality.

- **Keep continuity with the past:** It is vital to see ourselves as part of an ongoing journey started by our heroes in the Scriptures. Discipleship reaches back many thousands of years. We must connect with this through rituals that embody our archetypal imagery of The Great, The Good, and The Holy. For most Westerners, this is going to mean a very clear and comfortable ownership of their Judeo-Christian symbols of transformation.
- **But make it local:** These can and should be complemented by some local, homegrown events and rituals. But remember, great archetypal symbols are not simply created on a weekend outing. Develop a great liminality-communitas tradition over time.
- **Build it into the ritual life of the church:** Develop a regular (yearly?) ritual in the church service where people who have ventured well over that year can be recognized as “heroes” of the community. Liturgy is important if we are to embed liminality-communitas into the life of the faith community. Also, rituals experienced early on often become much more meaningful later in life. So even where much of the more symbolic or theological aspects might go over the heads of some of the younger folk, the hero system that is implied will stick and will hopefully become a functioning part of their mythic universe of meaning.
- **Formalize the experience for the children:** Richard Rohr says that as far as introducing children into the culture, “neither the father and mother, nor any of the leaders of the community, ask the child’s permission if he ‘wants’ to do this. The ideal attitude is that it is expected and to be desired, which must start some years before and eventually exist as a tradition within the family. This lack of ‘a tradition of expectation’ is much of our problem today, but we have to stick together long enough to create a history for ourselves.”²³
- **Confer social rewards for local heroes:** Certain rights and status should be granted for people who have passed through liturgically recognized liminality-communitas experiences. This might sound elitist, but we know from anthropology that people will not take the proposed idea seriously if rights are conferred cheaply and without accountability.
- **Create symbols of achievement:** Part of the use of symbols can be to indicate that a person has passed the “test.” Traditionally societies have marked the bodies of initiates. Perhaps a tattoo or a necklace or something symbolic can be conferred.
- **Create a mentor system:** It is essential that an intimate mentoring connection be established between the younger and older disciple-adventurers. This allows mutual love and respect to emerge, while transferring status and responsibility within the community. It also creates some sort of formation and preparation and in the larger group.
- **Learn from Hollywood:** We can observe from all cultures that initiation rites tend to have a character of mystery and secrecy, both to create necessary anxiety and interest beforehand, and to free from the impossibility of explaining everything afterward. If we take this seriously, then aside from the general terms of time and place, don’t tell people a whole lot beforehand, except that they have to experience it to understand it. And afterward, as Heinrich Zimmer says, “the best things cannot be talked about.”²⁴ This creates a sense of expectation, mystery, and intrigue that adds a romantic element to adventure.

We love the way Hope Church in Springfield, Illinois, has developed the following set of criteria for developing communitases in their church:

1. You must care about people who don’t know Jesus.
2. Your small group must believe that God can reach the person.
3. Your small group must make a plan.
4. Your small group must overcome difficulties.
5. Your small group needs the courage to do something different.
6. Your small group members must work together to get the job done.
7. Your small group must be willing to pay the cost to bring someone to Jesus.²⁵

We have in all likelihood overstated our case in this chapter. It’s probably too long, contains too much theology, stories, illustrations, and theories related to liminality-communitas. But we do so because we believe that liminality-communitas is laced throughout our best understandings of life. And we also strongly believe that the church ought to recover this wonderful aspect of what it means to be Jesus’s people. If we are able to develop this more vigorous expression of human community, we are sure people in our lost world will be drawn by a desire to be part of a group that is doing something great in the world.
