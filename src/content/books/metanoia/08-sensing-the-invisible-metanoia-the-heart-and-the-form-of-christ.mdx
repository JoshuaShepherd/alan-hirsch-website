# Sensing the Invisible: Metanoia, the Heart, and the Form of Christ

> "Reciting the poems of Hopkins is an immersion in inscape, a thorough and glorious apprenticeship in sensing the invisibles and inaudibles that give cohesion and wholeness to everything that we see and hear and taste, not just its superficial appearance but the inner core of individuality."
>
> — Eugene Peterson, *Practice Resurrection* (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2013), 19, 139–140

## The Ineffable and Immediate Insight

Abraham Heschel refers to what he calls "the ineffable"—the reality that is accessed through immediate and personal insight. This mode of knowing isn't exclusive to religion but cuts across all arenas of human knowledge. There is even a discipline dedicated to the "eureka effect" or insight studies.<sup>1</sup>

Martin Buber notes:

> "Undergirding every scientific discovery is some moment of intuition or confrontation. Therefore, all essential knowledge begins with an I-Thou encounter, and is contained in an enduring concept."  
> — Martin Buber, "Replies to My Critics" in *The Philosophy of Martin Buber* (La Salle: Open Court, 1967), 692.

Similarly, physicist Alan Lightman identifies intuition and insight as critical to creative breakthroughs in art and science.<sup>2</sup>

## The Necessity of Repentance and Paradigmatic Change

E. F. Schumacher argues that paradigmatic change is fundamental to growth and maturity.<sup>3</sup> Statistics from Protestant churches in places like the Netherlands and Great Britain support this view.<sup>4</sup>

H. Richard Niebuhr, in his examination of the church's responsibility for society, highlights the requirement for corporate repentance.<sup>5</sup> The papal encyclical "Memory and Reconciliation: The Church and the Faults of the Past" further expounds on this theme.<sup>6</sup>

The call to *metanoia* (repentance) pervades both the Old and New Testaments (e.g., Ez 14:6; Zech 1:3; Mt 23:29–39; Mk 1:15). Norman Todd defines "godly organization" as one ordered to God’s will and intention, for which metanoia is absolutely necessary.<sup>7</sup>

Historically, collective repentance is seen in movements such as the Confessing Church in Nazi Germany and in the Confession of Belhar, which emerged from churches complicit in apartheid.<sup>8</sup>

Reinhold Niebuhr analyzes collective sin's nature in his classic, *Moral Man and Immoral Society*.<sup>9</sup>

## The Iconoclasm of Reality and the Dangers of Reductionism

> "Images I must suppose, have their use or they would not have been so popular... Images of the Holy easily become holy images—sacrosanct... He is the great iconoclast. Could we not almost say that this shattering is one of the marks of His presence? The Incarnation is the supreme example; it leaves all previous ideas of the Messiah in ruins."  
> — C. S. Lewis, *A Grief Observed* (New York: Faber & Faber, 2015), 76–77

Our problems often stem from reductionism—reducing complex realities of God, people, gospel, and mission into manageable, simplistic formulas. This results in a fragmented understanding that, according to the New Testament, can be termed heresy: grasping a fragment of truth then claiming it as the whole.<sup>10</sup>

Niccolò Machiavelli insightfully remarks on the profound difficulty and danger of introducing change, as those benefiting from the old order resist, while those who could benefit from the new are often apathetic.<sup>11</sup>

> "All our problems are the result of reductionisms in our understanding of God, people, gospel, and mission... Reductionism is problematic in any field of knowledge, but it is particularly problematic when it comes to knowledge of the transcendent God."  
> — Hirsch and Nelson, *Reframation*

---

## Tradition, Traditionalism, and the Magisterium

Dialogues within the church reveal a distinction between "Sacred Tradition" (capital T) and "traditions" (lowercase t). Sacred Tradition, not merely habitual practices, carries interpretive authority in the church.<sup>12</sup> An over-reliance on "traditionalism" can lead to stagnation and resistance to God's mission.<sup>13</sup>

## Maps, Metaphors, and Mental Models

> "We don’t think about these maps or decide if we want to use them; they become so much a part of our ingrained way of relating to the world in families, churches, and societies that we assume our internal understanding and practices of how the world works is precisely how the world works."  
> — Alan J. Roxburgh, *Missional Map Making* (San Francisco: Jossey Bass, 2010), xi–xii

Metaphors function as maps that shape our perception, behavior, and institutions. When root metaphors change, so does everything else. Historical paradigms, such as the parish system in England, often persist beyond their utility, impeding adaptation to new realities.<sup>14</sup>

## Childlike Wonder, Unlearning, and the Renewal of Mind

> "The feeling of wonderment is the source and inexhaustible fountainhead of [the child’s] desire for knowledge... The reason why the adult no longer wonders is not because he has solved the riddle of life, but because he has grown accustomed to the laws governing his world picture ... He who does not comprehend this situation, misconstrues its profound significance, and he who has reached the stage where he no longer wonders about anything, merely demonstrates that he has lost the art of reflective reasoning."  
> — Max Planck, *Scientific Autobiography* (New York: Citadel, 1949), 91–93

Childlike thinking is crucial for renewal and discovery.<sup>15</sup> Martin Heidegger concurs: learning requires simultaneous unlearning.<sup>16</sup> Similarly, the apostle Paul’s call to "renew the mind" (Rom 12:2) is a call for constant openness and transformation, not merely an attitude adjustment.<sup>17</sup>

## Christology, Form, and Participation

> "Christ is the primary pattern of Christianity: in his face the glory of God shines and from there radiates into the heart of Christians (2 Corinthians 4:6) ... He is the one and only exposition of God (John 1:18), infinitely rich and of a paradoxical simplicity that integrates all the elements. He is absolute sovereignty and absolute humility; he is infinitely approachable who can be reached by everyone and infinitely inaccessible, ever beyond reach."  
> — Bede McGregor and Thomas Norris, *The Beauty of Christ*, 216

The "form of Christ" involves the overall pattern or gestalt—the complete, integrated figure through which the parts become intelligible. This Christoformity is both divine and human, archetypal and personal, the standard by which the church and individual believers find their true identity and vocation.<sup>18</sup>

Bonhoeffer aptly names the church as "the form of Christ in the world:"  
> "The Church is nothing but a section of humanity in which Christ has truly taken form."  
> — Dietrich Bonhoeffer, *The Cost of Discipleship*, 59

---

## The Role of the Spirit and the Mind of Christ

> "If Jesus is the One who interprets God and makes him known in the world (John 1:18), then it is the purpose of the indwelling Spirit to interpret Jesus to us—Spirit to spirit. Jesus himself said as much: '[The Spirit] will guide you into all truth... it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you' (Jn 16:13–14)."  
> — Hans Urs von Balthasar, *Prayer*, 71–73

The Spirit empowers believers to receive and manifest the mind of Christ (1 Cor 2:11ff), providing an ever-deepening openness to the mysteries of God. Without the Spirit, our understanding of Jesus is flattened, unable to hold the tensions of his revelation.<sup>19</sup>

Paul compares the impressing of the knowledge of Jesus to the creation of light out of darkness (2 Cor 4:6).

## The Heart: Center of the Person

Drawing from both Old and New Testament usage, "the heart" encompasses the thinking, feeling, and willing ego—the seat of all faculties and the primary locus of human responsibility to God.<sup>20</sup>

Henri Nouwen reflects:

> "The word heart in Jewish-Christian tradition refers to the source of all physical, emotional, intellectual, volitional, and moral energies... It is the seat of the will; it makes plans and comes to good decisions. Thus the heart is the central unifying organ of our personal life. Our heart determines our personality, and the place where God dwells, but also the place to which the Evil One directs fierce attacks, causing us to doubt, fear, despair, resent, overconsume, and so on."
> — Henri J. M. Nouwen, *Spiritual Formation* (New York: HarperOne, 2015), Kindle edition

Paul Minear adds that reason is always employed by love; if we do not love God with all our mind, heart, and soul, we simply love something else with the same wholeness.<sup>21</sup> Metanoia, therefore, activates the entire heart, integrating mind, soul, and will.

---

## The Whole Person and the Triple Command of Love

> "God lays rightful claim to every facet of human personality: heart (affection), soul (spirit), mind (intelligence), and strength (will). Each of the four commandments is prefaced by the Greek preposition *ex*, meaning 'from the source of,' rather than 'by means of.' Thus, we are commanded to love God not simply with our whole heart, but from our heart."  
> — James Edwards, *The Gospel According to Mark: Pillar New Testament Commentaries*, 771

The biblical vision is of entire-person devotion. Orthodoxy (right belief), orthopraxy (right action), and orthopathy (right affection) are all required to truly know and love God.<sup>22</sup>
