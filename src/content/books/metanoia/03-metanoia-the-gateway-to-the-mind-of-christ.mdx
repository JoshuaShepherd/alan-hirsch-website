# Metanoia: The Gateway to the Mind of Christ

> "Love of invisible things."<sup>5</sup>

## Metanoia and the “Mind of Christ”

How do we access the mind of Christ, and what role does metanoia play in relation to it? According to Alister McGrath, the purpose of metanoia is to provide the “process of spiritual and intellectual re-orientation and re-alignment, in which the believer comes to share in the mind (*nous*) of Christ.”<sup>6</sup> Through ongoing practices of metanoia, the human mind becomes increasingly configured to the mind of God in Jesus, so that:

> “Our senses acquire something of the spiritual quality of the Lord’s glorified senses … so that, in him and together with him, we can grasp the Father and the Spirit and the entire world beyond.”<sup>7</sup>

In Christ, we are enabled to comprehend things differently from the world’s standard forms of wisdom—whether science, philosophy, the arts, economics, or religion.<sup>8</sup> As Paul writes:

> “We have access to these and all the mysteries which ‘no eye has seen, nor ear heard’; no one who has not received the Spirit ‘is able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned’.”<sup>9</sup>

As noted in a previous chapter, metanoia acts as a portal into an alternative universe—a gateway to the mind of God (the Logos)—leading to greater attunement to God and his purposes in the world.

Although the mind of Christ remains an inconceivable grace given by God to his people, there are conditions associated with experiencing its fullness. Paul says only those disciples committed to increasing conformity to Christ—“the mature”—are enabled to understand and operate with divine logic more fully:

> Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish. But we speak God’s wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written,  
> "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him”—  
> these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.  
> For what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one comprehends what is truly God's except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God. And we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.  
> Those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to them, and they are unable to understand them because they are discerned spiritually. Those who are spiritual discern all things, and they are themselves subject to no one else’s scrutiny.  
> “For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.  
> *—1 Corinthians 2:6–16 NRSV*

Within the broader context of these verses (1 Corinthians 1:18–31), Paul clearly distinguishes among the religious beliefs held by Jews, Greeks, and Christians. True believers have left behind previous beliefs and practices to follow Christ—through metanoia. What previously enlightened or satisfied them no longer does; they have, in effect, de-converted from former worldviews. As a result, Jesus has granted them new consciousness, a new mind and heart, which changes absolutely everything.<sup>10</sup>

Receiving a new heart—as explored further in subsequent chapters—is like being given a new operating system, a new identity, a new way of seeing, and a new mental map of the world (see Ephesians 4:23; Colossians 3:10–11; 1 Corinthians 2:16). As a result, we develop a deeper resonance with the things of God.

## The Spirit of Christ and the Mind of Christ

As noted previously, there is nothing automatic about receiving the mind of Christ. It is entirely an act of God’s pure and unimaginable grace, entrusted only to true disciples—those who are:

- Committed to the process of sanctification,
- Seek ever-greater attunement to the holy,
- Aim to become increasingly Christlike.

Furthermore, having the mind of Christ is only possible through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit:

> "[We] walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law—indeed it cannot, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you."
> 
> —Romans 8:4b–11 NRSV

Receiving the mind of Christ is a profoundly spiritual process. Hans Urs von Balthasar remarks:

> “The Holy Spirit implants the mind of the Son of God into our hearts so that we may fashion our lives accordingly.”<sup>11</sup>

He adds,

> “The Holy Spirit can be recognized at work in a person by establishing in them the mind of Jesus.”<sup>12</sup>

Jesus tells his disciples:

> “He will take what is mine and declare it to you.” —John 16:15 ESV

Paul echoes:

> “And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image … For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.”  
> —2 Corinthians 3:18 ESV

The Spirit’s role in the Christian community is not to replace an absent Jesus, but to render him present in new and intensely personal ways. It is the fundamental mission of the Holy Spirit to lead the Christian community into ever-increasing concordance with Christ. The Spirit is the agent by which the mind of Christ is given. As von Balthasar explains:

> “[A] new intellect is created by the Spirit, who alone fathoms the depths of God and enables the intellect to grasp these realities [the facts of revelation] in an obscure but real manner. This new intellect is at first rudimentary, but, as it comes into play, it gradually grows more luminous; it shares in the knowledge that God has of himself … Developing through the gifts of the Holy Spirit, through the gift of knowledge and the gift of understanding, the new intellect makes the mind familiar with divine realities, and enables it to grasp them in all their fullness and to assess the evidence that they present.”<sup>14</sup>

Through the Spirit, we gain access to depths and breadths, insights, and possibilities we could never have received on our own and yet are now truly our own.<sup>15</sup> This new mind is able to:

- Understand, accept, and see correctly, widely, and wisely,
- Discern with instinctive sensitivity to God,
- Respond with readiness to God’s will and direction.

From this spiritual wisdom, we are empowered to:

- See ourselves anew,
- Recognize the inherent design of things,
- Comprehend the eternal purposes of God,
- Address and resolve problems by engaging the mind that created and sustains the world.

## Christo-Logic: Dimensions in the Mind of Christ

The experience of thinking with the mind of Christ is referred to as “Christo-logic.” The remainder of this chapter and several appendices will further explore what the mind of Christ is, how it can be accessed, and how to live by it.

### Christo-Logic is Formatted According to the Pattern of Christ

Because metanoia calibrates the believer to Christ, who is the Word of God, Christo-logic is logic derived from the pattern of Jesus Christ. We can only be confident that we know the Divine Mind and operate accordingly through the prism of Jesus’ life and teachings—he is “the way and the truth and the life” (John 14:6). Jesus fulfills the messianic logic of the Old Testament and, as the eternal Word (*Logos*), is always God’s way of revealing his mind (Hebrews 1:1–3; Colossians 1:17):

> “Christ is the infinite form of truth revealed in the world … [Therefore] a faithful account of truth, of the God-World relation, can only be found in Christ.”<sup>16</sup>

The Bible summons us to metanoia—to leave everything and follow Jesus as the standard for understanding ourselves and the world.<sup>17</sup> Therefore, we know the truth of God only by rooting ourselves in Jesus’ life and thinking outward from there:

> “Whoever wants to be Jesus’ disciple is called first to repentance, then to take up their cross and follow Jesus by conforming their lives to him in discipleship” (Matthew 16:24).

Transformation comes from decentering former narratives and identities and centering our lives on Jesus:

> “And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.”  
> —2 Corinthians 3:18

Recognizing and attuning ourselves to the Christ-pattern underlies our ability to fulfill God’s intentions in every sphere—calling, purpose, daily decisions, church life, and service.<sup>18</sup> Paul’s ecstatic declaration underscores this:

> “We look at this Son and see the God who cannot be seen. We look at this Son and see God’s original purpose in everything created. For everything, absolutely everything, above and below, visible and invisible, rank after rank after rank of angels—everything got started in him and finds its purpose in him. He was there before any of it came into existence and holds it all together right up to this moment…”  
> —Colossians 1:15–20 MSG

According to Paul, the world is created in the pattern of the Son; “in him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). Thus, through Jesus, we interpret all things—including fragmented human experience—finding their proper place in him.

> “I ask—ask the God of our Master, Jesus Christ, the God of glory—to make you intelligent and discerning in knowing him personally, your eyes focused and clear, so that you can see exactly what it is he is calling you to do, grasp the immensity of this glorious way of life he has for his followers…”  
> —Ephesians 1:17–23 MSG

If we miss what God is doing in Jesus, we are lost, for we cannot comprehend God apart from Christ (John 14:6). Jesus is not only how we know God but also the archetype of true humanity. N. T. Wright explains:

> “If you want to know who God is, look at Jesus. If you want to know what it means to be human, look at Jesus. If you want to know what love is, look at Jesus. If you want to know what grief is, look at Jesus. And go on looking until you’re not just a spectator, but you’re actually part of the drama which has him as the central character.”<sup>19</sup>

In other words, Jesus sets the norm for Christian life and the life of the church.<sup>20</sup> Blaise Pascal agrees:

> “Jesus is the center of all, the object of all; whoever does not know him, knows nothing aright, either of the world or of himself.”<sup>21</sup>

Bonhoeffer maintains:

> “The way in which the form of Jesus Christ takes form in our world is the concrete, obedient, con-formation of human beings to the form of the biblical Christ, the man whose existence for others is the world’s true reality.”<sup>22</sup>

### Christ and the Church

Humans are therefore to be ordered to Jesus; only in him is humanity comprehensible. The church, as the communal human expression of Christ, is central to God’s purposes. The church should be the embodiment of Christ—a visible demonstration, a “proof of concept,” of God’s intention for the human race.

Bonhoeffer observed the consequences when the church loses conformity to Christ, as seen in German churches during the Nazi era:

> “Discipleship means adherence to Christ, and … must take the form of discipleship. An abstract Christology, a doctrinal system, a general religious knowledge … renders discipleship superfluous … Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Christianity without discipleship, and Christianity without discipleship is always Christianity without Christ.”<sup>23</sup>

Therefore, the form of Christ is critical for recognizing the authenticity of the church and for assessing the world’s condition from a Christ-centered perspective (Ephesians 4:13).

Thankfully, the indwelling Spirit makes Jesus known to us so we might conform to him. The Spirit facilitates the ongoing universal enfleshment of the Word, applying Christ’s life to every Christian life and to the church.<sup>25</sup> Through metanoia, we are redefined by Jesus and find our true measure in him.

## Christo-Logic: A New Perspective

### Seeing Everything from God’s Perspective

Metanoia opens the door to the mind of Christ by posturing the soul to receive revelation, encountering God, and embracing transformation. Through metanoia, we share in Jesus’ own consciousness, gaining a Christlike perspective instead of a merely human one (Romans 8:6). Paul exhorts:

> “Look up, and be alert to what is going on around Christ—that’s where the action is. See things from his perspective.”  
> —Colossians 3:2 MSG<sup>27</sup>

Devenish describes this transformative vision:

> “[Believers] have been given access to a new dimension of reality … privy to a special kind of knowledge … out of the mind of God. To sustain this transformative vision … they must hold their gaze … To look inwardly is to see the face of Christ; to look outwardly is to see from Jesus’ point of view.”<sup>28</sup>

Many problems arise from limited perspective. For example, Peter rebuked Jesus in Matthew 16 because he set his mind on human outcomes rather than God’s:

> “Jesus turned to Peter and said, ‘Get away from me, Satan! You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God’s.’”  
> —Matthew 16:23 NLT

Without Christ’s mind, we remain locked in worldly logic.

Ralph Winter used to say:

> “Every major decision you make will be faulty until you see the whole world as God sees it.”<sup>30</sup>

#### Exercise: Testing Perspective

1. Prayerfully ask Jesus what he thinks about wealth and money, and the assumptions in capitalist understandings (meritocracy, plutocracy, property rights).
2. List your thoughts on one side of a page.
3. On the other side, note the world’s typical perspectives on these topics.
4. Compare the lists. How do they differ?
5. Repeat for issues of power, leadership, race, gender, forgiveness, service, enemies, suffering, and trials.
6. Reflect on your organization's structure in light of Jesus’ teachings.

The confrontation with Jesus’ different way exposes why repentance (metanoia) is required to see and live according to his perspective.

### Christo-Logic: A Self-Transcending Form of Thinking

True learning and growing toward maturity requires an open, metanoic, and self-transcending mind—a mind delighted by discovery:

> "As love of learning turned to learning love  
> And explanation deepened mystery."<sup>31</sup>

God infinitely exceeds our understanding. Gregory of Nyssa writes:

> “When the eye of the soul turns towards God, it is thrown back by the lightning flash of the Infinite.”<sup>32</sup>

Because God is infinite, any advance in understanding him blows apart human categories—“the reward of the search is to go on searching ... for really to see God is never to have had one’s fill of desiring Him.”<sup>34</sup> Thus, authentic belief implies relating to a being infinitely greater.

Infinity-thinking—*sub specie aeternitatis*—means seeing the world through the lens of eternity, acknowledging the limits of our own thinking.<sup>35</sup> This is a perspective valuable beyond theology—in leadership and organization as well. Simon Sinek refers to this as “the infinite game”—the need to adapt, innovate, and thrive under ever-changing conditions.<sup>36</sup> Most people, however, remain within non-metanoic, closed mindsets, reaffirming existing beliefs, and dismissing differing evidence.<sup>38</sup> This closed-loop thinking is evident in social media echo chambers and ideologically captive religious extremism.

Metanoia broadens our horizons and delivers us into a “bigger world,” compelling deeper commitment and engagement.

> "The ability to change your mind, to learn, to adapt, is a superpower."  

Christo-logic allows us to solve the world's problems from outside the closed-loop logic that created them.<sup>40</sup>

---

### Christo-Logic: Holistic Thinking

Reductionism—analyzing complex realities only in terms of their simple or fundamental parts—plagues all human knowledge. In the theological realm, this is called heresy: theological reductionism, or making big ideas small. N. T. Wright notes:

> “Heresies do not come about by straightforward denial … They happen when an element which may even be important, but isn’t central, looms so large that people can’t help talking about it … as though this were the only thing that mattered.”<sup>41</sup>

C. S. Lewis similarly observes:

> “We have all departed from that total plan [of Christianity] in different ways, and each of us wants to make out that his own modification of the original plan is the plan itself … every one is attracted by bits of it and wants to pick out those bits and leave the rest.”<sup>42</sup>

Like the parable of the blind men and the elephant, heresy results in fragmentary, incomplete consciousness, incapable of experiencing Jesus’ fullness.

The solution? The reversal of reductionism through *metanoia*—reintegration with the universal whole. Theologians describe this as catholic (kata+holon): measuring all things "according to the whole." This is akin to the Hebrew concept of *shalom*—not merely absence of conflict, but the presence of wholeness and harmony.

Synthesis—explaining reality as more than the sum of its parts—is the antidote to heresy and reductionism. Hans Urs von Balthasar refers to this as symphonic thinking, which, like an orchestra, finds unity in diversity and generates emergent new meaning. Theologically, God’s truth is “symphonic”—living, dynamic, and ever-unfolding.<sup>44</sup>

---

### Christo-Logic: Spiritual Instinct

Union with Christ injects into the believer an instinct or “inbuilt bias to all-things-Jesus.” This includes:

- Attunement to God’s will, always consistent with love (John 15:1–17),
- Awareness of truth embedded in the parts/the whole,
- Gut-instinct born of deepening attunement to Christ.

This spiritual instinct is not mere guesswork; it is pattern-based and Christoform, the wisdom of the mind of Christ.<sup>47</sup>

Analogy: Sharks swim without knowing the theory, birds navigate continentally without studying GPS. Likewise, our spiritual instinct is latent within by virtue of the Spirit. In “startle” situations, a tacit knowledge emerges. Daniel Kahneman’s “thinking fast” and Malcolm Gladwell’s “blink insight” suggest rapid, spontaneous decisions can be just as valid as considered ones.<sup>50</sup> Godin adds:

> “Intuition: That’s what people call successful decision making that happens without a narrative. Intuition isn’t guessing. It’s sophisticated pattern matching, honed over time. Don’t dismiss intuition merely because it’s difficult to understand. You can get better at it by practicing.”<sup>51</sup>

Therefore, a corresponding supernatural instinct ought to characterize Christian life. What is learned by spiritual instinct will always align with scripture, the law of love, and the pattern of Jesus’ life and teaching.

Paul identifies five distinct intelligences and instincts (APEST—Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher; Ephesians 4:1–16) as expressions of the mind of Christ given to the body. Barth calls these “the modes of Christ’s royal presence in the church”!<sup>54</sup>

---

### Christo-Logic: Discerning and Joining What God is Doing

As previously explored, conversion—*te/shuva* (reorientation) and *meta-noia* (a new mind)—aligns us to God, enabling us to discern and join his purposes. Jesus is our archetype:

> "The truth is that the Son does nothing on His own; all these actions are led by the Father. The Son watches the Father closely and then mimics the work of the Father."  
> —John 5:19 (The Voice)

Jesus’ perspective flows from looking at all things from God’s point of view. After his resurrection, the apostles operated with this Christologic consciousness (Philippians 2:5), looking through Jesus’ eyes and becoming “insiders” of his understanding.

> "I'm no longer calling you servants because servants don't understand what their master is thinking and planning. No, I've named you friends because I've let you in on everything I've heard from the Father."  
> —John 15:15 MSG

This ability to find God everywhere and join in his work lies at the core of the mind of Christ. Thus, ministry is less about human ingenuity, and more about joining in what God is already doing, discerning his activity, and aligning ourselves and our communities with him.

> "Be assured that from the first day we heard of you, we haven't stopped praying for you, asking God to give you wise minds and spirits attuned to his will, and so acquire a thorough understanding of the ways in which God works."  
> —Colossians 1:9 MSG

Metanoia allows us to perceive, respond, and align with the pattern of Christ, providing access to the infinite mind of God.

> "For we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words", by calling Abba, Father, not somewhere outside or above us, but actually in us and from within us.<sup>58</sup>

Metanoia is a cyclical process of repentance, returning, re-orienting, reframing, renewal, restoration, realigning, and recalibrating—at both the individual and ecclesial levels.

---

## Activating Mind, Soul, and Will

> "To experience metanoia is to quicken the conscience by the holiness of God, to feed the mind with the truth of God, to purge the imagination by the beauty of God, to open the heart to the love of God, and to devote the will to the purpose of God."  
> *—William Temple*

> "Faith is a way of experiencing which is undertaken with one’s whole being, all out, “with all one’s heart, with all one’s soul, and with all one’s might.” Faith is our way of leaning into life."  
> *—Michael Eigen*

> "And when you return, you will remove every trace of idol worship. I will give you a whole heart and a new spirit; I will take from you your hearts of stone and give you tender hearts of love for God, so that you can obey my laws and be my people, and I will be your God."  
> —Ezekiel 11:18-20, Authors’ Translation

> "Jesus wants faith from the heart. He wants the very center of our being and not just a couple of nerve twitches from the threshold of our ego."  
> *—Helmut Thielicke*

We often speak of “having a change of heart,” yet biblically, to change your heart or mind is not simply to think differently, but to become someone else. As explored above, authentic transformation is a renovation of one’s personal ethos.<sup>1</sup>

---

## The Heart—Key to True Transformation

Metanoia, as the openness to ongoing reframing and remapping, threatens the intrinsic conservatism of institutions. This explains both individual and institutional resistance to change, as seen even in religious organizations. Only by integrating the collective mind, soul, and will toward un/learning and transformation can lasting renewal take place.

The Bible’s consistent, unavoidable appeal is for wholehearted change. The primary words translated as “heart” (Hebrew *leb*, Greek *kardia*) occur over 750 times. Biblically, “heart” is largely a metaphor—central to understanding revelation, psychology, and spirituality.

Notably, the heart is:

- The seat of understanding,
- The source of thought and reflection,
- The root of the will and all resolve.

Thus, it is the origin of all significant human actions, loyalty, and the battleground of competing desires and lords. Catastrophe results from failing to master the heart, as it is also the source of both good and evil.<sup>7</sup>

When God says, “Give me your heart” (Joel 2:12–13), he calls for the source of imagination, will, and love. If God gets our heart, he gets our whole self.

---

## Heart: One Reality, Three Dimensions

Scripture portrays the heart as three interrelated, but distinct, dimensions:

1. **Mind (Intellect)**
2. **Soul (Affective/Pathos)**
3. **Will (Volition/Choice)**

Christian history relates these to the three dimensions of faith:

- *Notitia*: Intellectual element,
- *Assensus*: Emotional element,
- *Fiducia*: Volitional element.

Transformation involves the uniting of these elements, engaging the whole being at the core of consciousness. True metanoia is “wholehearted,” integrating mind, soul, and will.

---

## The Mind and Mindfulness

In scripture, “mind” (*nous/noia*) refers to a way of thinking—a mindset rather than simply the physical brain.<sup>11</sup> The mind assimilates and makes sense of experience. Because the mind is inseparable from the heart, any change of mind is a change of heart, and vice versa.<sup>12</sup> Transformation and paradigm shift require addressing prevailing rationality and reframing ideas. Genuine metanoia demands evaluating and re-scripting existing mental maps.<sup>14</sup>

Leaving the mind out of transformation leads to directionlessness and despair. One must remain conscious of the reasons, strategies, and truths guiding their life and leadership.
