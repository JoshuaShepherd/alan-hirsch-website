# The Call to Metanoia: A New Orientation in Discipleship

> “Repentance is not so much looking back with regret, but forward with hope; not downwards at our own shortcomings, but upwards at God’s love.”  

We have often appropriated our faith in individualistic ways and within the narrow confines of organizational discipleship. As a result, our collective mind (_nous_) has been significantly closed, our spiritual instincts dulled, and our capacity to learn, adapt, and respond to the ever-greater God severely impaired.

## Repentance as Grace

Far from the stereotypical perception of repentance as something that leaves us feeling diminished and ashamed, it is time to recognize _metanoia_ as a beautiful grace of God. This grace enables us to transcend the bounds of our current condition and opens us up to an expansive understanding of God, the world, our organizations, and ourselves. Properly understood, repentance is not negative. It is not self-pity or merely remorse, but conversion—the re-centering of our whole life on the Trinity.

Repentance means:
- Looking forward with hope, not backward with regret
- Looking upward at God's love, not downward at our shortcomings
- Seeing not just our failures, but what, by divine grace, we can become—and acting upon it

> “To repent is to open our eyes to the light.”

## The Many Dimensions of Metanoia

### Mind-Blowing Transformation of Understanding

Jesus could have begun his ministry in any number of ways, delivering what we now celebrate as the Great Commandments or the Sermon on the Mount. Instead, his first words were:  
> “The time has come … the kingdom of God has come near. Metanoiete and believe the good news!” (_Mark 1:15_)

To even hear and understand the profound truths Jesus teaches, we must first open our minds and hearts to metanoia. Encountering Jesus is an immediate invitation to fundamental transformation—to truly know God is to change. Discipleship, therefore, is a radical reorientation, centering our being around God's reality.

- _Metanoia_ is the doorway to Jesus’s spiritual revolution.
- It reveals that God is not “out there”; we are in God and God is in us.
- With the mind of Christ, our perception of reality is profoundly altered.

#### A New Way of Seeing

Stuart Devenish writes:

> “In an event paralleling Paul’s conversion when scales fell from his eyes (Acts 9:18), the convert undergoes an opening of the mind toward previously unknown dimensions of reality.”

Paul’s call to be “transformed by the renewing of [our] minds” (_Romans 12:2_) signals that metanoia renews our self-understanding, our relationships, and our scale of values. It allows us to experience the boundless possibilities that lie beyond prevailing customs and ideas. Bernard Lonergan calls this a “horizon change”—when all our mental maps and core commitments are reordered.

- Metanoia is much more than confessing guilt or doing penance.
- It is imagination invigorated, awakening to wonder.
- Conversion is often a gradual process, unfolding over a lifetime—not simply a one-time event.

#### Lifelong Learning

Sanctification is both instantaneous and ongoing; so is salvation—we are called to “work out [our] salvation with fear and trembling” (_Philippians 2:12_). Western evangelicalism, with its focus on one-time decisions, underplays the ongoing process of conversion. As Eugene Peterson said, discipleship is “a long obedience in the same direction.”

> “Breakthrough involves a shift in your understanding because the lens through which you view the world has been changed. A breakthrough is a sudden advance—moving you past a barrier and enabling you to see and understand in a new way.”
>
> —Olivia Fox Cabane

Genuine openness to metanoia should mark the lives of those committed to loving and serving the ever-greater God.

### Ever-Expansive Reframing of Reality

Humans are often bound by reductive ideologies and idolatries. _Metanoia_ offers a cleansing of perception, allowing for an expansive, fresh view of the world and of God—one that is crucial for ongoing transformation and growth.

Excluding metanoia leads to a diminished capacity to recognize the greatness of God, ultimately stunting the maturity of individuals and organizations.

### Metanoia as a Crack in Your Cosmic Egg

Metanoia is responsible for breakthrough moments—those paradigm-shifting insights that radically reorient our lives. Philosopher Joseph Chilton Pearce describes this creative process as becoming aware of a “crack in the egg” of our self-contained worldview, a moment when clarity and understanding pour in.

> “By serendipity or grace, the crack suddenly opens enough that the light flows in, illuminating what has just become so clear and easy to express.”  
> —Joseph Chilton Pearce

These moments often come as sudden revelations—_Aha!_ moments—which are at the heart of learning and creativity, whether in faith, art, or science.

#### Metanoic Breakthroughs

Theologian David Schindler calls such moments “originary experiences.” History—Christian, scientific, or artistic—is shaped by countless such breakthroughs. We tend to fear metanoia, seeing it as exposing our failures, but in reality it enables us to see anew the beauty that awaits when we turn toward God’s reality.

When spiritual leaders experience discouragement and frustration, there is perhaps no better time for metanoia—a re/turning, a re/orienting—toward the abundant life Jesus promises.

### What’s Excluded from Our “Maps”?

E. F. Schumacher’s metaphor of omitted churches from Soviet-era maps symbolizes the exclusions within our “mental maps”—things we do not see or integrate into our paradigms. Schumacher challenges us to look around with fresh eyes and integrate what we have previously excluded.

The greatest obstacle to charting a faithful future is the illusion that our current understanding is the starting point for forward movement. As Epictetus noted, “It is impossible for a person to learn what they think they already know.”

#### The Importance of Renewed Mental Maps

True transformation in individuals and organizations requires paradigm change. To recalibrate the church and restore integrity, we must engage with the full dimensions of conversion—allowing for a radical, system-wide, Spirit-generated shift.

### Why is Metanoia Urgent within the Church?

#### Because We Generally Suck at It

A failure to adapt and repent underlies much of the church’s decline, as seen in European contexts unable to shift in the face of cultural change. There is a prevalent resistance to collective repentance, both in Europe and the US, hindering spiritual authority and vitality.

> "When the institutions of society are subject to question... the Church undertakes to change its own use of these institutions and to lead society in their reformation. ... It repents for the sin of the whole society."  
> —H.R. Niebuhr

Throughout Scripture, the call to repentance is addressed primarily to corporate entities—nations and the church. Are we exempt from this call?

#### Because Any Advance in Knowledge of God Requires Repentance

To move toward the transcendent God requires the radical opening of mind and heart—_metanoia_. God forever shatters our preconceptions; “if you have grasped something ... it is not God” (von Balthasar).

> “God is the great iconoclast. ... It is sheer grace that he shatters our small conceptions and liberates us to know him more truly.”

The metanoic mind is humble, able to adapt to God’s self-revelation. Without it, faith becomes reductionist and rigid—incapable of maturing.

#### Because if We Fall in Love With Our System, We Lose the Capacity to Change It

Upton Sinclair warned, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” Systems can ensnare leaders, blinding them to the faults of their organizations.

Institutions take on a “towering effect” and are mistaken for ultimate authority. Even religious structures must be held accountable to Christ. “To honor the tradition does not excuse one from beginning everything each time, not with Augustine or Thomas or Newman, but with Christ.” (von Balthasar)

We must program ongoing change—_metanoia_—into our definitions of church:

> “If change and growth are not programmed into your spirituality... your religion will always end up worshiping the status quo.”  
> —Richard Rohr

#### Because We Can’t Lug It All Along With Us

Tradition connects us to the wisdom of the past, but _traditionalism_ outsources our thinking and binds us to ways that may now be obsolete. Jesus relentlessly challenged religious convention and traditionalism.

> “In times of change... most of the tried is, in fact, false. ... The nature of revolutions is that they destroy the perfect and enable the impossible.”  
> —Seth Godin

The _semper reformanda_ principle calls us to continual adaptation and learning, recognizing that all living systems must expel waste (obsolete practices) to stay healthy. Metanoia is essential for this kind of renewal.

#### Because We Need to Redraw the Maps to Fit New Territories

Our inherited cultural “maps”—mental models—often lag behind the present realities. Churches frequently try to address modern contexts with outdated frameworks:

> “They are trying to negotiate twenty-first-century New York with a map of sixteenth-century London, Rome, or Geneva.”

Adam Grant notes we often prefer the comfort of old views over grappling with new realities. The anxious urge to preserve the status quo stems from fear; by contrast, metanoia encourages us to carry God's truth into new cultures and questions.

- Faithfulness demands the courage to redraw our maps; to cultivate an explorer’s heart and a metanoic mind.

#### Because When the System Gets Jammed Up, We Need to Push Reset

Addressing symptoms is insufficient; organizations—and the church—require regular recalibration to their foundational purpose. Repentance is the “system reset,” realigning all things with Jesus.

- Recalibration is not glamorous, but essential.
- Realignment with original values prevents “mission drift.”

> “We need to reJesus. We need to repent!”

#### Because in Order to Learn, We Must First Unlearn

No one can learn without first unlearning. Regular repentance, or unlearning, is the price of transformation.

- Learning is iterative and relational, involving leaps beyond our current thinking (meta-thinking).
- Jesus teaches that we must become like children—childlike openness is prerequisite for transformation.

> “No one can learn who is not prepared to unlearn. ... Only by what we can unlearn do we prove our capacity for learning.”  
> —Wilhelm Stählin

Unlearning is twice as hard as learning; often, it is not the inability to learn, but the inability to unlearn, that hinders growth.

> “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”  
> —Alvin Toffler

Learning and unlearning are continuous, iterative processes. Metanoia enables us to transcend previous understandings and break through to new ways of seeing.

> “We must unlearn the constellations to see the stars.”  
> —Jack Gilbert

## Christo-Logic: Seeing the World from Inside the Mind That Created It

> “The Holy Spirit implants the mind of the Son of God into our hearts so that we may fashion our lives accordingly.”  
> —Hans Urs von Balthasar

> “You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self... and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.”  
> —Ephesians 4:17–24

_John Howard Griffin’s_ Black Like Me recounts his journey through the Jim Crow South in an attempt to understand life as a Black man. His experience illustrates the radical transformation that comes from seeing the world through another’s eyes.

Consider what it might mean to “put on Christ”—to see and experience the world as Jesus does. This would constitute nothing less than a mental revolution.

### The Mind of Christ

The New Testament offers the astonishing claim that Jesus’s characteristic capacity—to see everything through the eyes of the Father—is given to his disciples. Far from being ethereal, “the mind of Christ” is transformative:

- It enables us to behold the world as it truly is, through the lens of the Logos, Christ himself.
- Sacramentality is the ability to see all reality as God’s theophany—God revealed everywhere.

> “Because through the mystery of the incarnate Word, the new light of your brightness has shone onto the eyes of our mind; that knowing God visibly, we might be snatched up by this into the divine.”  

---

**In summary:**  
Regular metanoia—repentance, reframing, recalibration, and unlearning—is not just for individuals but for the Body of Christ as a whole. It is the essential posture required to welcome deeper transformation, ongoing learning, and alignment with the mind of Christ. Only then can we be faithful explorers and bearers of God's truth in every time and culture.
