# From Core Values to Core Practices: The Embodied Will of the Organization

As always, these principles apply to both individuals and organizations. As we will see, acting our way into a new way of thinking is a key aspect of discipling an organization.

As examined in Chapter Five, part of discipling the organization means becoming a wholehearted organization—one that engages the mind, soul, and will. It is through the consistent application of spiritual and missional practices that the will of the organization is fully engaged. These practices and disciplines do not happen by accident; they must be learned, and therefore, teaching them is an essential function of leadership for the future of the church.

Fortunately, we can learn from historic missional and monastic orders that gathered around:

- a transformative vision (the paradigm/mind of the organization),
- a unifying culture and structure (the platform/soul of the organization), and
- a common set of practices.

Whereas the paradigm (mind) is hidden, and the platform (soul) is experienced, the practices are visible to all because they are a conscious expression of the will. The organization has a choice: to do them or not. Through practices, organizational metanoia becomes tangible and embodied—noticeable both to members and to the surrounding community.

To engage the will, we must be motivated and animated by love for God and people. People act on what they love, not just what they think. To be a wholehearted person and organization therefore requires being rooted deeply in God’s love. We are called to:

> Love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love our neighbor as ourselves.

In this context, "strength" can be understood as the will or willpower. Thus, common practices, when motivated by love, embody the values of the organization and are lived out through the lives of its members and their wider community. In other words, practices are specific expressions of our core DNA, which are fractalized throughout the organization.

This progression follows the upcurve, as illustrated in the diagram on page 170. If the paradigm contains the DNA to be scaled, and the platform is designed for scale, it is through practices that scale is achieved. This scale requires the organization to strengthen its willpower.

Addressing the practices of the organization, we will focus on the rhythms and tools needed to help people move from the sidelines into active participation—we love the word "rhythm" because it refers to movement in a uniform and recurring pattern. Ultimately, our aim is to help catalyze and be a part of Jesus’ movement in the world.

To foster healthy rhythms that lead to movement, we will address the following:

- From Core Values to Core Practices
- From Action to Habits
- From Rhythms to Algorithms

## From Core Values to Core Practices

In the previous chapter, we addressed the importance of core values—something most organizations and churches have already identified. Core values are often displayed on walls, in literature, on websites, and more. So far, so good. The problem arises in actually living them out.

One reason for this is that we have mainly informed people’s heads and not required anything of their behavior. In communities shaped by values, it’s hard to disagree with them—each value often has a Bible verse attached, and who can argue with Scripture? But because value statements appeal primarily to beliefs and don’t require much else, the common response is mere assent:

- Of course, we believe in evangelism (though rarely practice it).
- Of course, we believe we must care for the poor (though we seldom do).
- Of course, we believe in prayer (but seldom practice it).

You get the idea.

> **Stanley Hauerwas states:**
>
> *Christianity is not a set of beliefs or doctrines one believes in order to be a Christian, but rather Christianity is to have one’s body shaped, one’s habits determined, in such a way that the worship of God is unavoidable. In our embodied life together, the words of our doctrines take on flesh. If one of our orthodox beliefs has no corporeal value, if we cannot come up with a single consequence it has for our embodied life together, then there is good reason to ask why we should bother with it at all. The issue is not whether there is any such thing as purely spiritual holiness, but whether there is anything beside the body that can be sanctified.*<sup>5</sup>

The problem is that simple value statements can quickly become platitudes—preferred ideals rather than lived-out values. Without the development of practices based on those stated values, establishing core values becomes purely an intellectual exercise, not a compelling way to live. People rarely assimilate values into their lives simply by reading a list of principles or hearing them in a sermon.

Instead of merely writing, talking, teaching, and lecturing about culture and values, we suggest you develop common practices that give people pathways to act their way into a new way of thinking.<sup>6</sup>

### Practical Steps to Develop Core Practices

1. **Formulate the Core Values:**  
   If you haven’t already, form your list of core values rooted in the development of your platform/culture. For effectiveness, limit the list to six to eight (and no more than ten).

2. **Brainstorm the Core Practices:**  
   Gather the broadest possible leadership group. Ask them to list all possible ways (practices) each value could be lived out and observed by others.

3. **Distill and Refine the Core Practices:**  
   Review the practices to ensure they connect with everyday life. Core practices should be regular, everyday rhythms, not just annual service days or once-in-a-lifetime mission trips.

4. **Formalize the Core Practices:**  
   Choose the one (no more than two) practices that best embody each core value. Ensure these are not seen as particularly "religious" or church-based, but as close to everyday life as possible. For example, if the core value is hospitality, consider practices like weekly shared meals, monthly visits to the sick, or inviting others to stay in a spare room.

5. **Name the Core Practices:**  
   Develop an acronym that summarizes your core practices. Make it memorable.

6. **Encourage and Expect the Core Practices:**  
   Expect members to regularly participate in these practices. Encourage engagement through regular scheduling, communication, and by spotlighting or rewarding positive behavior.

7. **Foster a Culture of Accountability:**  
   Encourage accountability so the core practices lead to fruitful personal and organizational transformation.

> **Summary Flow of Developing Core Practices:**
>
> brainstorm core practices → distill and refine → formalize → name → encourage and expect → foster accountability

## From Action to Habits

In a church culture characterized by constant activity—much of it good, but not always fruitful—another method for establishing common practices is the deliberate development of key habits.

Habits are deeply ingrained rhythms, depositing culture within people as dispositions, capacities, and inclinations—shaping how people think, feel, and act. These can be positive or negative and, over time, become second nature. Recognizing the organization as a habit-supporting institution is crucial; the aim should be to help people replace unhealthy habits with healthy ones. By deliberately deciding which habits to pursue, the organization predetermines its future actions. This is another facet of discipling the organization.

In _The Power of Habit_, Charles Duhigg describes habits as consisting of three elements: a cue, a routine, and a reward. He suggests that changing habits requires understanding the cue and the reward, but the key is altering the routine.<sup>7</sup> Leaders should focus on developing "keystone habits"—those that trigger other positive changes.

**Example: Small Groups as Keystone Habit**
- People desire connection (cue).
- They attend a small group (routine).
- The reward is socializing (and some Bible study).
- If leaders shift the routine to a more missional model (missional communities), the reward remains, but the entire culture shifts toward intentional discipleship.

**Building Muscle Memory for Spiritual Practice**

Muscle memory is a neurological process: once a motor skill becomes ingrained, it can be performed unconsciously—which enables mastery, like typing quickly or playing an instrument. Similarly, spiritual habits—formed by consistent practice—become second nature and deeply formative.

> "Neurons that fire together, wire together."

The power of habit, muscle memory, and will is foundational to both individual and corporate discipleship formation—a theme found throughout Scripture. For example:

- 1 Timothy 4:7–16: "Train yourself to be godly"; "set an example"; "devote yourself"; "be diligent"; "persevere".
- 1 Corinthians 9: "Train in such a way as to win the prize."
- 2 Peter 1:3–11: Practicing Christian virtues keeps us effective, recalls our salvation, confirms our calling, and ensures entrance into Christ’s kingdom.

**Key Questions for Leaders:**

- Are our key actions part of an intentional discipleship process?
- What habits already exist in our community?
- What fruit do these actions or habits produce?
- How are they forming the community?
- What routines, if changed, would lead to the greatest spiritual formation?

## From Rhythms to Algorithms

Why did Facebook beat MySpace, Google outpace Yahoo, or Amazon dominate? The answer: they had better algorithms.

While rhythms and algorithms are connected, they are not synonymous.

- **Rhythms:** Repetitive actions set to time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
- **Algorithms:** Constructed around repetitive actions, but not necessarily set to time; fundamentally focused on learning from repetition to achieve a purpose.

**Illustration**:  
In the early nineteenth century, Joseph Marie Jacquard used algorithms to create programmable looms for complex textile production—an early example that foreshadowed modern computing.

The importance and power of algorithms cannot be overstated. They are central to today’s platform revolution.

### Why Algorithms Matter for Organizations

- **Enable Ongoing Metanoia:** Algorithms are about learning. They introduce experiential learning and continuous improvement (metanoia) into everyday operations.
- **Refine Vision, Mission, and Strategy:** They require clarity of purpose and the design of action steps, ensuring ongoing refinement through feedback and iteration.
- **Aid Decision-Making:** Algorithmic behavior produces data and learnings, empowering better organizational decisions and discernment.
- **Reveal Organizational Desire ("What Wants to Happen"):** Effective algorithms surface people's passions and strengths, unleashing engagement in the mission.
- **Facilitate Movement:** By requiring specific actions in order, algorithms create dynamic, purposeful movement within the organization.

> **Example Algorithm – For Charlotte Network:**  
> 1. Connect with a new pastor/leader  
> 2. Get to know them  
> 3. Match them to the appropriate network/initiative  
> 4. Equip and unleash them to go and do the same

Steve Addison’s summary of early Christian movements:

> Connect → Share → Train → Gather → Multiply

Consistent and intentional algorithms can change how a church or organization learns and grows, enabling large-scale mission impact and spreading organizational DNA.

# The Power of Tools in Scaling Mission

> *“We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.”*  
> —Marshall McLuhan

Just as with the smartphone in your hand, tools shape the way we operate and live. Monumental shifts in history—like Gutenberg’s press or the internet—were driven by new tools. Thus, it’s not a question of using tools, but which tools and to what end.

## What Good Movemental Tools Do

- **Build Trust:** Trust is the currency of mission-based organizations. The right tools enhance your organizational reputation.
- **Add Value:** Good tools help people connect, grow, and fulfill their sense of calling—encouraging widespread adoption.
- **Fractalize DNA and Meta-Ideas:** Tools serve to embed key principles and culture throughout the organization.
- **Remove Friction and Enable Scale:** The best tools are simple, "sticky," and scalable, making participation easier.
- **Expand Capacity:** Tools equip people to accomplish the mission independently, freeing up leadership resources.
- **Foster Innovation and Partnership:** Tools sometimes require internal innovation or external collaboration.

> **Case Study:**  
> The "State of the City Report" coffee table book distributed over 40,000 copies, brought clarity, unity, and actionable data to citywide leaders. It catalyzed not just organizational trust but also innovation and partnership at scale.

---

## Types of Movemental Tools

When discerning which tools to adopt, consider two key aspects:

1. **Social Spaces and Relational Dynamics:**
    - We all need to belong in different social spaces (public: 70+, social: 20–50, personal: 5–12, intimate: 2–4 people), and tools should serve each space appropriately.
    - Churches often overuse public and personal spaces, underutilizing social and intimate spaces, which are best for discipleship.

2. **Leveraging Technology:**
    - We live in an era where every problem seems to have an "app." Technology allows scale and access, despite potential downsides.
    - All types of tools listed below can be amplified with technology.

### Tool Categories

- **Physical Tools:**  
  Tangible resources that empower everyday missional living.  
  _Example: The "Who's My Neighbor?" fridge magnet—a simple, effective tool to encourage neighborhood engagement._

- **Training Tools:**  
  Resources that enable equipping, apprenticing, and experiential learning (rather than just classroom teaching).  
  _Examples: BELLS framework (Bless, Eat, Listen, Learn, Sent) and HUDDLE framework._

- **Communication Tools:**  
  Frameworks for narrative, data, and theory communication, ensuring broad engagement across audiences.

Different people respond to different modes. Using all three forms (narrative, data, theory) engages both hemispheres of the brain and promotes better learning.

# Joining the Dance

Have you attended a Greek wedding? The communal dance, involving at least three dancers in perfect synchrony, creates palpable joy and unity.

The dance reflects the divine perichoresis of the Trinity—God’s invitation to join His joyful movement.

The Greek wedding illustrates the correct order of the Metanoia Journey:

1. **Shared paradigm** (celebration and love)
2. **Cultivated platform** (joyful, communal environment)
3. **Set practices** (dancing together in rhythm)

When all elements come together, the collective will is engaged and the organization is poised to change the world.

> *"Do not call people back to where they were (they never were there). Do not call people to where you are, as beautiful as it may seem to you. But travel with them to a place neither of you have been before."*  
> —Vincent D. Donovan

# Wash, Rinse, Repeat: The Ongoing Metanoia Journey

The journey of learning and change is never complete. Having ascended one peak through adaptive change, organizations must gather their energy and begin again—committed to ongoing metanoia.

There will always be new challenges, crises, and wicked problems to solve. Organizations committed to metanoia become true "learning organizations"—dynamic, adaptive, and innovative by nature.

> *"Church is an infinite game; there’s always a new set of challenges to deal with."*  
> —Simon Sinek

Regular metanoia is not a burden, but the root of ongoing fruitfulness. It is associated with childlike wonder and awe.

## Childlikeness and Metanoia

Jesus said:

> *"Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."*  
> —Matthew 18:3–4 (ESV)

Childlikeness—humility, playfulness, openness to wonder, and an accepting spirit—enables ongoing un/learning. Einstein retained a childlike curiosity, claiming, "I have no special gifts. I am only passionately curious." Michael Polanyi observed that metanoia is an intensified adult form of the worldview development found in children. Recovering this approach ("beginner’s mind") is the path to spiritual wisdom and creative breakthroughs.

## Conclusion

We hope this journey has revealed the joy and gift of repentance—metanoia. It enables renewed experience of God, freedom from obsolete ideas and practices, and openness to unforeseen possibilities. May you and your organization have the courage to undertake the Metanoia Journey, continuing with perseverance and hope, knowing Christ is always present and a great prize awaits.
