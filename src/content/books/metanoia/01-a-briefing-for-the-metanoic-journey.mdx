# A Briefing for the (Metanoic) Journey

> *The whole conception of the Kingdom is so novel that only those who are ready to make a new start can even see it, let alone enter into it.*  
> — William Temple

It is one of the sad ironies of aging that, after decades of struggle and learning, one finally discovers an idea that would have made all the difference had it been properly understood earlier on the journey. **Metanoia** has been such an idea for me (Alan). If I had understood this life-changing concept when I was younger, I believe my work with various organizations and denominations, as well as in local ministry, would have been far more effective.

I have therefore written this book for Christian leaders, in the hope that they might see greater fruitfulness, as well as avoid significant frustration in their own discipleship and in their various organizations—whether churches, non-profits, or marketplace enterprises.

## The Pre-History of This Book

This book has a rather unusual history.

The idea of metanoia was explored as a key theme in the book I co-authored with Mark Nelson, *Reframation: Seeing God, People, and Mission Through Reenchanted Frames*.[^1] As the title suggests, *Reframation* explores the importance of seeing things in a different frame in order to advance in our knowledge of God and his mission. Metanoia—paradigm shift and conversion that changes the heart—is the gateway for seeing through a different, Jesus-shaped lens and is therefore a topic explored throughout *Reframation*. The topic is also explored throughout my writings: the missional paradigm shift in *The Forgotten Ways* and *On the Verge*, and the need to re-examine the fivefold/APEST (apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, teacher) ministry in *5Q*, in particular.[^2]

But the real stimulus for this book began when Movement Leaders Collective, the organization I co-founded and co-lead, chose the theme of metanoia for our global gathering in May 2020—situated amid the ideological swirl of the Trump presidency and the early experience of the global pandemic. Given the apocalyptic nature of the global crisis, the theme resonated with all present and proved to be somewhat prophetic in nature. Because so little was known or understood by most Christians on the topic, and because it was so needed in these times, I decided it was important to write a book that focused solely on metanoia and how it can be implemented to bring transformative change in both self and society.

### Co-Authors and Perspectives

Early on, I approached Dennae Pierre to co-write the book with me. As a highly capable leader of Redeemer City to City (North America) as well as Surge Network in Phoenix, Dennae is not only a remarkable young leader whom I deeply admire but also would have brought a much-needed female perspective to the book. I am convinced that many of the problems we currently face arise from the fact that almost all thought leaders and theologians (in the Protestant world at least) are male and therefore see things through a distinctly one-dimensional, male outlook. This deficit in the female perspective means we are not getting the whole picture. And, with apologies to Einstein, we must recognize that we cannot solve our (decidedly male) problems with more of the same (male) kind of thinking that created them in the first place.[^3] This necessitates an integration of the female mind and voice into the equation. By co-authoring, Dennae and I wanted to show we really do need each other to answer the problems we seek to resolve.

However, Dennae went through a season of growth in her work and family (including an unexpected fifth child!). She felt led to focus on developing the new leaders on her teams and decided the Spirit was calling her to forego the writing project with me. Thankfully, she did not withdraw before she offered some invaluable commentary and editorial feedback on the material I had written. And so, I want to acknowledge her input into the shaping of this book. Watch out for Dr. Dennae Pierre! I believe she is a highly significant, thoroughly refreshing, emerging voice in missional movements.

Believing deeply in the synergistic value of co-authoring, I subsequently approached my dear friend and colleague, Rob Kelly—an energetic leader and advocate of city movements everywhere. Rob is a gem of a human, is super smart, and has a unique grasp of what it means to design movemental organizations that span whole cities. Like me, he loves theology, the social sciences, organizational leadership, and generally all things nerdy. We resonate deeply on just about everything. He was therefore a natural fit.

Although I am the primary author of this book, Rob made a significant contribution by taking the lead on three chapters in part two (chapters seven through nine) and by adding editorial comment throughout. Since I did secondary editing on his material, it is expressed using the common word “we.” Occasionally, we will refer to the “I” when relaying autobiographical content, as I am doing now, and Rob will do later.

## Issues of Style and Substance

If you have read any of my previous books, you’ll be familiar with my style and approach. This book is no different: it seeks to provide substantive but distilled content applicable to discipleship and spirituality, as well as to leadership in the local church or organization.

True metanoia, in the biblical sense, is inseparable from the person of Jesus, and so Rob and I make no apology for using theology to guide best practitioners in a way that is consistent with the God we confess and love. To be a disciple means we can never rely solely on pure pragmatics and the “can-do” techniques so prevalent throughout church-growth thinking. Such pragmatism has contributed to many serious issues we now face—including celebrity leadership, one-dimensional churches, and expensive, complex structures that are almost impossible to change.[^4] As God’s beloved children, all believers are expected to become better at thinking thoughts after God and following his ways (Ephesians 5:1). Certainly, all Christian leaders are expected to operate from a theologically informed mind, arising from the discipline of seeing the world through the prism of God-logic.

Thinking and speaking theologically is important because theology is the “authorized language” that reaches deep into our collective consciousness to retrieve reserves and resources that lie largely hidden and unused.[^5] If we wish to properly motivate Jesus’ church from the inside out, then we simply must speak with the authority derived from deep within the Word.

As you read this book, keep in mind that, in Scripture, genuine knowledge of God cannot be merely theoretical; it involves the loving mutuality of knowing and being known (yada in Hebrew and epignosis in Greek). Knowledge of God comes only through direct contact with God—not simply through abstract thinking about him. For example, there is a world of difference between describing the attributes of God’s justice, generosity, and love, and personally experiencing all these things in our daily lives in such a way that they change us. In this latter form of knowledge, we are informed, impacted, touched, and transformed at the same time.

To allow the content of this book to have this effect on you, we suggest you read it slowly, section by section—preferably on your knees. Prayerfully seek to attune yourself with what God is revealing to you along the way. This approach will lead you to a place of discovery and will allow you to look again … to reframe.

Although we offer a distinctly biblical understanding of metanoia, we also acknowledge that metanoia is by no means limited to the religious realm. Not only did the word (and the basic concept) originate in ancient Greek, but it is also experienced in all arenas of life. Ironically, some of the very best thinking on metanoia (yes, they actually use that term) is found in the secular marketplace, from authors such as Peter Senge, Otto Scharmer, Margaret Wheatley, and Fritjof Capra, among others. We will refer to them throughout.

Adopting the language of leadership and organization, this book outlines a comprehensive “theory of change”—essentially, how and why a desired change is expected to happen in a particular context. There is much to learn from the social sciences and organizational psychology in this regard.

Because of the way we use theological and sociological material, and because of the relative unfamiliarity with the depth of meanings inherent in the biblical theology of conversion and repentance, this work may feel dense and may require careful attention. Contrary to our culture of quick reads and quick fixes, we encourage you to slow down, look again, and break through the veil of familiarity you may have with these ideas. The teaching on repentance is a case in point. Although it’s been in the Bible all along, it has all too rarely been understood as Scripture itself intended. So we encourage you to be patient with the text.

## Change in Two Dimensions: Personal and Collective

In all genuinely biblical forms of spirituality, the personal encounter with God must inevitably lead to loving action in the world. When we wrestle with deep, transformational change at the personal level, we become the kind of leaders who are able to deal with the exponentially more complex transformation required at the collective level—in the organizations we lead. This book will therefore address metanoia in both personal and collective dimensions.

> *It was psychologist Carl Rogers who famously noted that “what is most personal is most general.” This is not only true for psychology but is also particularly true for spirituality, be it individual or communal.*
>
> Henri Nouwen extrapolates:
> > Anyone trying to live a spiritual life will soon discover that the most personal is the most universal, the most hidden is the most public, and the most solitary is the most communal. What we live in the most intimate places of our beings is not just for us but for all people. That is why our inner lives are lives for others … why our most secret thoughts affect our common life.[^6]

Contemplation of God is the discipline that makes the heavenly dimension and truth of the Christian life present in the life of the disciple. What arises from these prayers is simply the working out of this truth in the transient conditions of this world.[^7]

In our deepest self-reflection, we discover that the roots of our personal problems are the same as those that permeate a sick society. In our personal struggle with brokenness, we cannot help but become critics of the prevailing social order. Conversely, as revolutionaries struggling to bring about a new world order, we will find that we are also fighting the same reactionary fears and false ambitions in ourselves that are laced throughout society. Thus, we soon discover that we cannot change the world without seeking to change ourselves.

> *Therefore, every true disciple is called to be a revolutionary at heart; the one who walks the way of Jesus is called to unmask the illusory quality of human society.*[^8]

Because these things are true, we will sometimes call for a personal experience of the joy of metanoia as we seek to follow Jesus in discipleship, and at other times highlight the need for collective (organizational, community, or even national) recalibration and conversion. These are two sides of the same coin, which means that the process we suggest for one applies equally to the other. This is clearly the case throughout Scripture, where God addresses both the individual heart and the sins of the collective. This two-dimensional understanding of metanoia will become clearer as we proceed; we simply raise it now to guide you as you read.

## Other Quirks of Style

Consistent with much of my previous writing, there are extensive endnotes throughout the book. These are meant to provide a deeper rationale for the concepts being explored, as well as stimulation for further study. We hope they will prove a fruitful resource for those wishing to pursue the topic at hand.

Throughout the book, we use the forward slash “/” to force double play on certain words—for example, un/learn, re/define, re/calibrate. This is a deliberate technique so the text is read more like poetry, enabling the sentence to be experienced in multiple dimensions.

The book refers to several appendices. If the topic is of interest, it can be found at [www.themxplatform.com](http://www.themxplatform.com), where it can be read online or downloaded. (See page 191 for the QR code.) Although part two focuses on practical approaches, space does not allow us to include the numerous specific resources and tools that have been developed to help implement the insights learned along the way. We will therefore be publishing a follow-up practical field guide, which will help those leading organizations and churches to take others through the journey of metanoia.

## Overview of Contents

This book seeks to articulate a thoroughgoing understanding of metanoia: why it is critical, how it works, and how it can be implemented.

- **Part One:** Focuses on the theological and sociological basis of metanoia and why it is critical for both ongoing relationship with God and our fruitfulness—whether as an individual disciple or as part of a collective. We look not only at the serious challenge that repentance poses to our current ways of thinking and acting but also at the blessings it brings—the mind-blowing, vision-enhancing, spiritually rich life God intended for us as his people.
- **Part Two:** Provides a model of metanoia entirely consistent with part one, but tried and tested in the white-hot context of key organizations seeking to become dynamic, innovative movements. The process suggested here has been developed for the various training and consulting services provided by Movement Leaders Collective (MLC, [www.movementleaderscollective.com](http://www.movementleaderscollective.com)). Here, Rob Kelly elaborates on the Metanoia Journey process developed by Rich Robinson (the global director of MLC) and myself, adding his own unique insight and expertise.

Rob has significant experience in this area, particularly regarding platforms and the role of networking for movements that seek to scale across cities and regions. We trust that part two will provide a tangible, actionable way to bring transformational change for those organizations willing to undergo the corporate metanoia required.

This is not a book for the fainthearted. It is dense and somewhat heady at times, but it is also intended to strike at the heart of our prevailing paradigms. You will not be able to read this book and remain unmoved, uninformed, or unchanged.

We encourage you to read the whole book because there is a certain logic to each chapter. However, if your pragmatic self is straining with the more conceptual material of part one and you are eager for practical content, we suggest at least reading:

- **Chapter Two:** Basic definitions—so you understand what we mean by “metanoia.”
- **Chapter Three:** A compelling rationale for why the church—and you as an individual leader—need metanoia and repentance.

After this, if you must, move to the practical content. That said, we urge you to wrestle with part one, as engaging with the ideas there will make all the difference to your practice later.

---

In all this, we hope you will find this material a challenging read that will not only call into question many assumptions you might hold but will also prove to be an exhilarating journey into the realm of ever-greater possibility.

In part one of this book, we propose a thorough framework for why metanoia is crucial for Christians in any era—but particularly in ours. We lament deeply that a genuinely biblical understanding of metanoia has been all but forgotten by large swathes of the church in the West. Certainly, our (Protestant) traditions passed on a highly reduced understanding of metanoia. How is it that we have managed to bypass, or even actively suppress, the incredible revelation given to the church on this vital topic? Much frustration could have been avoided if we realized that God has indeed bequeathed to us a potent avenue of change built into the faith itself. Missing this opportunity has been disastrous in the life of the disciple and even more so for the communities that are called to be the dynamic presence of Jesus in the world.

About a decade ago, I (Alan) co-founded a program to help megachurches adopt a scalable and disciple-reproducing model. We took roughly 250 large churches through the program in about five years. It pains me to admit that, despite all the effort and cost, it made precious little difference on the ground. Although most of the participants were highly capable leaders who loved the idea of multiplication movements, they tended to lean toward a more pragmatic style and therefore did not have the patience or desire to grapple with the mental mapping needed to inform and sustain significant organizational change.

Even those who managed to make the required paradigm shifts often lacked the deeply spiritual, transformational process that would lead to long-term change. We didn’t understand the importance of unlearning as a precondition for new learning, nor did we comprehend the process of conscious remapping needed to bring about genuine paradigmatic change. In other words, we failed largely because we did not understand the importance of collective metanoia in instigating change in both individuals and organizations. For the benefit of all involved, I hope to never make that mistake again.

All my work with organizations and leaders is now predicated on both the idea as well as the process of metanoia. Before moving to organizational re/design and leadership, I now encourage participants to take significant time to become consciously aware of their roles as stakeholders in the legacy system, of the often unspoken assumptions built into their mental models, of the flaws inherent in the dominant thinking, and of the many hindrances to movement that are deeply embedded in the culture and organizational practices. This is only the beginning of the process, but it is essential.

We are beginning to see evidence of real change as viable movements emerge from this challenging and disruptive season. We have found that individuals and leaders (and their organizations) who are willing to explore and appropriate the sheer grace of metanoia find themselves ushered into a place of new possibilities and increasing faithfulness. The reason for this, as we shall soon explore, is that metanoia involves having a radically open mind. From this perspective, change is not something to be avoided but is rather a form of sanctification—the process of being increasingly attuned to God and to his purposes in the world.

To be a disciple—a person seeking increased conformity to the human archetype of Jesus (God’s way of being human)—means to be committed to an ongoing journey of change, of letting go and letting be. It is not only entry to the kingdom of God that requires metanoia (Mark 1:15) but also being increasingly attuned to God (Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18). Metanoia is, and ought to be, integrated into the process of becoming more and more like Jesus.

In our work with organizations seeking to embrace the mission of the church, we believe the stifling status quo is caused partly by our inability to bypass obsolete ideas and practices and to tap into better, more situationally appropriate ways of thinking and acting. All these issues require metanoia—paradigm shift and conversions that change the heart—if they are ever to be resolved.

---

At the collective level, metanoia ushers an organization into becoming what social scientists call a “learning organization”—an organization skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights. Clearly, new ideas are essential if any learning is to take place, but these can only be accessed and appropriated through the collective un/learning that takes place in a genuinely metanoic process. The basis of this will be laid out in part one.

We will start with an exploration of why metanoia is particularly appropriate in these apocalyptic times (chapter one); provide rich definition and nuance to the biblical teaching on the topic in chapter two; present a comprehensive rationale for why metanoia is critical across the system and throughout life in chapter three; show how metanoia leads us to seeing the world through the mind of Christ in chapter four; and propose an “anthropology of the heart”—the critical intersection of mind, soul, and will in transformational change—in chapter five.

By the end of part one, it should be clear that change is not only possible but necessary to the life of faith and to the effective missional impact of the church.
