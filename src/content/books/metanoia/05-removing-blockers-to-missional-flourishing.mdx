# Removing Blockers to Missional Flourishing

Many believe that once obstacles are removed, a community of believers will naturally flourish. For example, if your church seeks to be missional—focused on going out into the world (“go to them”)—but its practices are grounded in attractional models (“come to us”), then the attractional forms will always undermine your missional intent. In other words, the system’s “come-to-us-ness” cancels out the capacity for genuine “go-to-them-ness,” effectively blocking true missional engagement.

This remains a significant problem in the majority of churches today, which largely operate within an inherited Christendom paradigm built solidly on attractional forms of ecclesia. Such churches may affirm a missional identity, but systemic forces often render it unattainable. Evidence of this can be seen in how churches utilize their buildings and programming: everything about the physical space says, “come to us.” Understood in this way, attractional forces become blockers to a truly missional paradigm.

Applying a force-field analysis to your organizational vision allows you to identify what enhances or hinders your objectives. Here, metanoia (repentance and new ways of thinking/acting) comes into play by exposing what limits the achievement of your vision.

> “The composition of this book has been for the author a long struggle of escape, and so must reading of it be for most readers if the author’s assault upon them is to be successful—a struggle of escape from habitual modes of thought and expression. The ideas which are expressed so laboriously here are extremely simple and should be obvious. The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify into every corner of our minds.”
> — *John Maynard Keynes, Foreword to* *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*

Escaping old ideas is no small feat, especially in churches dominated by deeply embedded Christendom ecclesiology. Obsolete concepts, formed in different cultural contexts, still permeate the collective mind. To return to our first love (Revelation 2:1–7), we have much to unlearn. Only where God’s plow tills our lives can sowing bear fruit; deep repentance is necessary for a deepened interior life. Our primary task is to work for the spiritual revolution that leads to *metanoia*—a fundamental transformation of mind and heart.

We must also feel the pain of our own intransigence—the tension between our as-is state and the calling Jesus originally designed for us. Metanoia engages mind, soul, and will—an experience often marked by lament, referred to by Christian mystics as the “gift of tears.” Such tears engage both sides of the brain, uniting mind, soul, and will. Do not fear lament or weeping—corporate lament can act as a catalyst for communities seeking breakthrough. Almost every revival is marked by both weeping and rejoicing.

## Key Questions for the "Uncover" Stage

- What cultural upheavals or anomalies have surfaced in our organization or the world at large? 
- How do these inconsistencies make us feel? What do they reveal about problems in our system?
- Where have we recognized our unfaithfulness to God's mission and purpose?
- Are we willing to lament these failures before God and community?
- What are the cornerstone concepts or meta-ideas on which our organization is built?
- Can we identify three to five “blockers” (practices, habits, or cultural aspects) that hinder our purpose? What steps can we take to change them?

This is a spiritual quest—a search for transformative impact—which requires us to become explorers and trailblazers. Apostolic leaders, in particular, must chart new mental maps for their organizations. True change demands confronting deeply ingrained habits and defaults; “escaping” from such ruts is essential. This vital work, further explored in chapter nine on Practices, will inform the “organizational DNA” that undergirds future platforms and practices.

# Exploring New Frontiers: The "Unlock" Stage

In the Unlock stage, we examine new frontiers by:

- Comparing experiences with other agencies facing similar challenges
- Cultivating a culture of learning and receptivity
- Prayerfully and playfully envisioning new possibilities
- Embracing the childlike curiosity and imagination essential to learning

> “Children do not act as if their mental map is complete and reliable; they are open to outside guidance. Adults...live as if their mental map is the final word, making it impossible for them to live with the playfulness of children.”
> — *[Source]*

Approach this stage as a beginner rather than an expert. Adopt a hacker’s mindset to uncover weaknesses in current systems, learn from those with different outlooks, and examine solutions from other disciplines. Sometimes, answers come from unexpected places—like Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin.

### Key Questions for the "Unlock" Stage

- What recurring bad habits or behavioral ruts do we fall into?
- How do these patterns keep us bound to outdated thinking?
- What similar organizations are confronting these challenges? Can we learn from or help them?
- How might we explore new and better ways to accomplish our core tasks?
- If we could start over, what would we change?
- How can we step regularly outside our comfort zones and capture what we learn?

As self-awareness grows—through system assessment and exploration of alternatives—organizations can start identifying viable alternatives. Frameworks for new paradigms and signposts for the road ahead start to emerge.

# Paradigms in Practice: Movement vs. Institution

A movemental form of organization is distinguished by:

- Dynamic, world-changing vision and a "can-do" culture
- Relationships founded on shared purpose, not transactional arrangements
- A DNA-based structure pushing power to the outer edges
- Decentralized networks rather than centralized hierarchies—a "starfish" model over a "spider" one
- Adaptive design, scalability, and rapid reproduction
- Viral methods of growth

Contrast this with conventional, institutional forms to highlight opportunities for organizational unlearning and development.

Within the MLC Movement Lab, the six elements of *mDNA* (movemental DNA) serve as primary meta-ideas, helping define organizational core and culture.

# Understanding and the Turning Point

Through a process of thorough unlearning and new exploration, participants reach the bottom of the Metanoia Journey's U-curve: a moment of naked openness to God—the “abyss” in the hero’s journey. Here comes insight and revelation—the turning point.

> “After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force...The movement is natural, arising spontaneously. The old is discarded and the new is introduced.”
> — *[Source]*

This “Aha!” or *metanoic* moment brings a paradigm shift. It feels right at the deepest level, echoing the early church’s “rectitude” or the sense that something is so fitting it could not be otherwise.

> “To my mind there must be, at the bottom of it all, not an equation, but an utterly simple idea. When we finally discover it, it will be so compelling, so inevitable, that we will say to one another, ‘Oh, how beautiful. How could it have been otherwise?’”
> — *John Archibald Wheeler*

The new paradigm should be felt as a whole-hearted conversion—a response to the internal “archetypal church” striving for expression. This elegant solution is the fruit of passionate, sustained pursuit.

For many, the elegant solution is the paradigm of the church as a missional movement, echoing the transformative Jesus movements throughout history. While the specifics may vary, all organizations destined to embody the kingdom of God should reflect the fluid, adaptive, outward-bound nature of God’s mission.

# The Upward Journey: Inventing a New Future

The rest of the narrative unfolds the reconstruction phase—the upcurve of the Metanoia Journey—which is built on the insights and unlearning of the downcurve phase. Without fully undergoing this, organizations revert to prior routines, with institutional “muscle memory” pulling them back to old patterns.

## Seed / Mind (Mental Map + DNA)
## Tree / Soul (Culture + Structures)
## Forest / Will (Rhythms + Tools)

The upcurve process involves:

1. **Paradigm**: Developing a consciously articulated mental map and DNA—this is the “seed,” the conceptual foundation corresponding to the mind.
2. **Platform**: Shaping explicit culture and structures that guide outcomes—the “tree,” corresponding to the soul.
3. **Practices**: Manifesting these through accessible, repeatable practices—this is the “forest,” corresponding to the will.

A movement starts with a catalytic idea, grows healthy and big, and is sustained by the viability of each prior stage. If any phase is insufficient, movement stalls.

Despite widespread agreement on "missional" paradigms, they have largely failed to transform practice because theological shifts have not translated into lived culture and structure. True paradigm change requires deep integration of mind, soul, and will.

# Blowing the Collective Mind

> "I still believe that reformation is a permanent movement, that metanoia is the continuous demand made upon us in historical life."
> — H. Richard Niebuhr

> "One must forget many clichés in order to behold a single image...Insight is an attempt to think in the present."
> — Abraham Heschel

> "What is needed is not piecemeal reformation...but an alteration of the basis of character and of the habitual way in which the mind works."
> — James Luther Adams

> "It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so."
> — Mark Twain

Personal *metanoia* moments—the once-you-see-you-cannot-unsee revelations—have immense power to alter life and leadership trajectories. These transformative experiences drive leaders to reimagine the unity and mission of the church.

# Once Upon a Paradigm

A *paradigm* is a framework for perceiving a complex world, made up of the beliefs, ideas, and cultural constructs we share. Paradigms are often invisible, rarely questioned, and become our default lens for reality. In organizations, the paradigm is the “mind” driving unconscious behavior and choices.

#### For example:

> "We don’t know who discovered water, but it wasn’t the fish."  
> Fish live fully immersed in water, just as we inhabit our paradigms.

Or consider the family tradition of trimming both ends off a ham roast: the practical reason (a too-small pan) long forgotten, but the behavior mindlessly repeated.

While paradigms are essential, they can create “paradigm blindness” making us unable to see alternative approaches—something glaringly obvious to outsiders.

# Elements of Organizational Paradigm

### 1. Organizational Mind

- **Primary/Controlling Metaphors:** The terms and images a community uses to describe itself (e.g., “body of Christ,” “family of God,” “network”).
- **Heroic Stories:** Foundational narratives shaping identity, values, and mission.
- **Defining Idea:** The core organizational driver (e.g., MLC's defining idea is "apostolic movement").
- **Sense of Meaning:** Unique identity and cosmic mission (e.g., the “sentness” of the church as God sent Jesus, so Jesus sends us).

Together, these shape the collective mind and the organizational worldview.

### 2. Mental Map

The mental map is the more conscious articulation of the paradigm. It moves implicit assumptions to explicit beliefs:

- **Meta-Ideas:** Foundational, high-leverage concepts around which everything else is built (e.g., mDNA's six elements).
- **Belief System and Theology:** From inherited, often unexamined beliefs, to explicit, contextual theological statements.
- **Conscious Competencies:** Deliberate patterns and behaviors that can be practiced and taught.
- **Group Rationale:** The “why” and “how” of organizational practice, challenging inherited routines without clear purpose.

A well-designed mental map gives clear vision and direction.

#### Institutional vs. Movemental Paradigms

| **Institutional Paradigm** | **Movemental Paradigm**      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Building an organization   | Growing a movement           |
| Authority & Influence      | Inspiration & Purpose (Telos)|
| Command & Control          | Equip & Engage               |
| Top-down Management        | Decentralized Leadership     |
| Procedural & Slow          | Relational & Rapid           |
| Transactional Relationships| Shared Purpose               |
| Conservative/Protective    | Innovative/Entrepreneurial   |
| Security, Predictability   | Risk, Serendipity            |
| Siloes, Departments        | Unified Whole                |

### 3. Organizational Genetics (DNA)

Think of organizational DNA as the self-replicating, unique code that carries core beliefs, practices, and values:

- Encodes essential traits
- Self-replicates and scales fractally throughout the organization
- Forms the basis of replicable, scalable behaviors

The process for developing DNA:

1. Sense key ideas
2. Identify and name meta-ideas
3. Formulate memorable DNA statements
4. Embed in culture and structures
5. Fractalize through repeatable practices

#### Meta-Ideas as Levers of Change

Meta-ideas are not just any ideas but foundational ones that shape all others—like the doctrine of the Trinity or discipleship. They function as levers with which to move the whole system:

> “If I had a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, I could move the world.”  
> — Archimedes

# Essentials for Paradigm Shifts

## Requires Leadership Unity

A church or organization cannot unite around a new paradigm without a unified leadership team. Common barriers include:

- **Staff/Board Division:** Too often, senior staff and boards are divided; paradigm shifts require both working together.
- **Leadership Insecurity:** Some leaders fear paradigm critique reflects poorly on them. Ironically, addressing dysfunction builds respect and commitment while facilitating personal growth.

## Requires Apostolic Imagination

> “Organizations are perfectly designed to produce what they’re currently producing.”

Most churches have been built by pastors and teachers—producing primarily pastoral outcomes. But the church is called to more. “Apostolic imagination” encompasses:

- Right-brained creativity, risk, and innovation
- Willingness to embrace validated learning—even failure
- Cultivation of both left- and right-brain strengths, animated by the Holy Spirit  
- Perseverance: shifting paradigms requires deep, sometimes painful, change and takes time

## Requires Telling an Alternate Story

> “If you want to change a society, you have to tell an alternative story.”
> — Ivan Illich

True change comes not through reformation or revolution alone, but through a more powerful, inclusive story—one centered unapologetically on Jesus and his kingdom. Allow this story to reframe all systems and practices from the inside out.

## Requires Letting Things Die

As noted earlier:  
> *“If you fall in love with your system, you lose the capacity to change it.”*

Old systems must be relinquished—even beloved ones—to make way for new life.
