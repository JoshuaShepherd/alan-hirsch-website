# Shaping Culture, Platform, and Practice: Architecting Lasting Change

> "By the things they love, which is why idolatry is so dangerous. It is misplaced love, and it blinds people to the only Person worthy of our affections."

## The Power and Danger of Idolatry

Perhaps the clearest picture of how idols affect us is found in the golden calf narrative in *Exodus 32*. When Moses descended the mountain and saw the idol the people had created, he destroyed the golden calf, ground it into dust, and forced the Israelites to drink it—literally consuming their idol. It became part of them. From that point on, the Israelites are referred to as possessing the qualities of their idol: like the golden calf, they had eyes but could not see, ears but could not hear, and were described as hard-hearted and stiff-necked (stubborn).

## The Challenge of Systemic Change

The church, at times, may be chief among sinners regarding the clinging to systems, paradigms, traditions, and programs that need to be relinquished. This letting-go process is far from easy but is essential for any lasting change.

Management consultant Peter Drucker notes that organizations spend substantial energy teaching people what to do but insufficient time teaching them what to stop doing. He emphasizes the skill of *systematic and purposeful abandonment*:

> "The first measure is abandonment. Every three years, an organization should challenge every product, every service, every policy, every distribution channel with the question, 'If we were not in it already, would we be going into it now?' By questioning accepted policies and routines, the organization forces itself to think about its theory (or paradigm). It forces itself to test assumptions. It forces itself to ask, 'Why didn’t this work even though it looked promising when we went into it five years ago? Is it because we made mistakes? Is it because we did the wrong things? Or is it because the right things didn’t work?'  
>  
> Without systematic and purposeful abandonment, an organization will be overtaken by events. It will squander its best resources on things it should never have been doing or should no longer do. As a result, it will lack the resources—especially capable people—needed to exploit the opportunities that arise when markets, technologies, and core competencies change."<sup>16</sup>

## Shifting Paradigms: Seeing Reality as It Is

The final element necessary to shift paradigms is the ability to see reality for what it is. Max De Pree, a well-known businessman, asserted:

> "The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality."<sup>17</sup>

While Jesus decisively shapes the movement bearing his name, leaders must take seriously the task of delineating the framework within which people think about his church. Allowing Jesus to guide, leaders must manage how the organization sees itself and its function in the world. In essence, it is the job of leaders to define *ecclesia* for those they lead, placing a significant theological responsibility on leadership to ensure their vision aligns with the church Jesus built.<sup>18</sup>

For those who wear glasses, the necessity of looking through clear lenses is obvious. Unfortunately, leaders often view paradigms through lenses that distort reality. Some common “clouded” lenses include:

### Common Clouded Lenses for Leaders

- **Rose-Colored Glasses**  
  Leaders must be honest about what is truly going on in their organization, instead of seeing only what they wish to see. Excessive optimism can lead to misdiagnosis.

- **Confirmation Bias**  
  Common in our culture and especially in the church,<sup>19</sup> confirmation bias leads leaders to interpret reality in ways that affirm their existing beliefs, ignoring contrary information or reinterpreting ambiguous evidence to suit their attitudes. This is especially potent when leadership teams surround themselves with "yes-people" rather than encouraging diverse thinking.

- **All Answers, No Questions**  
  Leaders are often expected to have all the answers, but this is both exhausting and counterproductive. Defining reality is best approached with more questions than answers—remaining open to the unknown.

Abraham Heschel, American philosopher and rabbi, contends that prior knowledge can prevent us from truly seeing reality. He writes:

> "The principle to be kept in mind is to know what we see rather than to see what we know."<sup>20</sup>

He further teaches the importance of perceiving and thinking in the present—an ability that is foundational to true insight: *metanoia*.

## Becoming an Open-Minded Organization

As we seek transformation through the renewing of our minds, we must ask: *What does it mean to be an open-minded organization?*

Research in personality psychology demonstrates that open-minded people process information more inclusively and expansively. They are intellectually curious, creative, imaginative, interested in culture, and highly receptive to both new ideas and sensory information. Personality theorists describe this as a greater "breadth, depth, and permeability of consciousness" and a propensity to "cognitively explore" both abstractions and sensory impressions.<sup>21</sup> Open-mindedness allows individuals—and organizations—to see and understand things that others cannot.

Becoming an open-minded organization is central to *metanoia*. Our minds require continuous recalibration to the mind of Christ. While the task before us is daunting, history shows change begins with a small, innovative minority.

### The Diffusion of Innovation and Organizational Change

In a standard bell curve for the diffusion of innovation, the first 2.5% are called *innovators*.<sup>22</sup> When they embrace a new paradigm, early adopters (the next 13.5%) often follow. After them comes the early majority (34%). As leaders, we must ask ourselves: *Which group will we belong to?* Will we join the pioneering 2.5%—risk-takers willing to do the labor of wholehearted organizational change for the future of the church and its mission?

If so, we must intentionally shape our organizational culture and structures, enabling those we lead to embody new paradigms.

# Shaping the Collective Soul

> "The more I considered Christianity, the more I found that while it has established a rule and order, the chief aim of that order was to give room for good things to run wild."  
> — **G.K. Chesterton**

> "If you have attempted change, improvement, advancement, and growth but have not changed the underlying structures that cause the current tendencies for behavior, you are unlikely to succeed."  
> — **Robert Fritz**

> "Every system is perfectly designed to get the result it gets."

## The Metanoia Journey: Mind, Soul, and Will

- **The Seed / Mind:** Mental Map + DNA  
- **The Tree / Soul:** Culture  
- **The Forest / Will:** Rhythms + Tools (Structures)

As we journey upward on the Metanoia Journey, we now explore the concept of *platform*. Between the Seed and the Forest is the Tree; between Mind and Will is the Soul; between Mental Map + DNA and Rhythms + Tools lie Culture + Structures—the hinge between paradigm and practices.

## The Platform: The Hinge of Paradigm and Practices

The 2010 film *Inception* offers an insightful analogy. At its core, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) uses dream-sharing technology to implant ideas in a target’s subconscious. The key is that Cobb and his team cannot force a person’s mind to change—they must instead architect surroundings and scenarios so purposefully that the change emerges naturally from within.

In leadership, a similar dynamic exists. Leaders don't enforce new paradigms by fiat; rather, they architect platforms—organizational cultures and structures—so purposefully that new ways of thinking and acting naturally occur. When platforms align with new paradigms, practical implications emerge organically.

### Defining the Platform

While "platform" often refers to technology or personal branding, here it refers to an organization’s **movemental infrastructure**—the foundation for practices and rhythms. This infrastructure consists of:

1. **Organizational Structures**
2. **Distinct Collective Culture**

Platform's power cannot be underestimated—it shapes how people interact and move within an organization.

**Formula:**  
Platform = Culture + Structures

Platforms ensure an organization not only moves (structures) but moves *in the same direction* (culture). Healthy platforms, rooted in Christ and mission, enable the discipling of the collective organization, not just individuals.

Without movemental culture and structures, even the best paradigm remains sentiment—without movement.

## Components of a Movemental Platform

Movemental infrastructure requires both culture and structures to be architected and implemented. To understand their interplay, consider a table:

- The **structure**: a physical platform enabling certain functions.
- The **culture**: the type, material, and context of the table, which changes its use and feel.

Alignment between culture and structures is critical. Misalignment produces dysfunction and frustration.

## Lessons from Family Systems Theory

Mona Delahooke, in *Brain-Body Parenting*, notes the brain (like culture) controls behavior, while the body (like structures) is the visible expression. The nervous system's interconnectivity is called the "platform". Misalignment leads to dysfunction—outbursts, anxiety, illness. Similarly, organizational misalignment between culture and structures frustrates and impedes mission.

Organizational systems often "speak so loudly that people can't hear a word you're preaching." For example, church systems that preach mission but structure for consumption create confusion.

> "The medium is the message."  
> — **Marshall McLuhan**

What wins people is what wins them to the mission. Alignment of culture and structures is thus non-negotiable.

# Platform as a Set of Principles

Beyond infrastructure, *platform* also refers to the principles, rules, and processes for organizational governance—distinct from traditional, hierarchical models. Modern technology platforms (Facebook, Amazon, Google) have honed principles of networked, scalable operation, leading to the so-called "platform revolution." Applying these principles, which often reflect Jesus’ design for the Church, offers a "double alignment": with His intent and contemporary culture.

## Two Major Components: Culture and Structures

---

# Culture: The Soul of the Organization

As paradigm is the “mind,” platform—specifically, culture—is the “soul.” Culture embodies the core truth of the organization. As Peter Drucker famously quipped:

> "Culture eats strategy for breakfast."

Culture forms over time and must be intentionally crafted. Toxicity is common and health is hard-won. A healthy culture makes explicit what is valued; it must be named, concretized, and lived.

### Six Aspects of Organizational Culture

1. **Identify and Develop Theological Distinctives**
   - Build on orthodoxy while clarifying unique theological perspectives.
   - Articulate three to five theological distinctives for clarity and reproducibility.

2. **Formulate Core Values**
   - Translate the organization’s DNA into guiding principles.
   - Six to eight core values is best practice; they must be clear, imaginative, and deeply personal.

3. **Develop a Shared Vocabulary**
   - Define terms and create language consistent with the central paradigm.
   - Vocabulary shapes thought and action; verbal integrity is essential (see James 3:1–12; Matthew 15:11).

4. **Identify Heroes**
   - Highlight those who embody the organization’s values and mission.
   - Heroes serve as models for the community (Philippians 3:17; Hebrews 13:7; Hebrews 11:32).

5. **Celebrate Positive Behavior**
   - Regularly affirm culturally consistent actions.
   - Public rewards signal communal values (1 Timothy 5:17), but must avoid manipulation.
   - Rituals—stories, gifts, commissions—reinforce positive behavior.

6. **Brand the Organization**
   - Externally communicate your identity with integrity.
   - A strong brand keeps its promises and reflects internal culture and values.

### Final Thoughts on Culture

Combining theological distinctives, values, vocabulary, heroes, reward systems, and branding creates the organization’s ethos. This 'soul' is tangible—the “vibe” or magnetic field that shapes all who encounter it.

A well-developed culture determines:

- Behavior
- Decision-making
- Programming
- Resource allocation
- Organizational direction

**Summary of Critical Ingredients for Organizational Culture:**

1. Identify and develop theological distinctives
2. Formulate core values
3. Develop shared vocabulary
4. Identify heroes
5. Celebrate positive behavior
6. Brand the organization

With culture in place, structure can be addressed. Both must be developed concurrently for organizational vitality and movement.

# Architecting Movemental Structures

> "By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ."  
> — *1 Corinthians 3:10–11*

## Distinctive Principles for Movemental Structures

Church structures differ fundamentally from secular organizations. Consider the farmer and the carpenter: each trades labor but with different priorities—nature's rhythms for the farmer; materials and precision for the carpenter. Even a farmer, however, must build to support growth—like a trellis for a vine, a structure that is supportive yet invisible. Such is "movemental architecture"—deliberately constructed to enable growth and mission.

### Robert Fritz's Principle: The Path of Least Resistance

Once a structure exists, energy moves through it by the path of least resistance. Thus, an organization's platform shapes participant behavior automatically.

## Three Overarching Types of Structure

1. **Relationships:** People Structures
2. **Resources:** Operational Structures
3. **Results:** Measurement Structures

---

## Relationships: Designing People Structures

Leaders must determine how people will connect, grow, and lead to fulfill mission. Historically, church models have followed "pipeline" (industrial) structures—centralized, hierarchical, product-focused, and conducive to consumerism.

The platform revolution favors decentralized, networked structures:

- Pushes influence from the center to the margins
- Encourages participation and resilience
- Fosters organic, viral growth

A key shift is from hierarchical control to community influence, reflecting Christ’s servant leadership (John 13:1–17).

**Questions for Leadership Teams:**

- Is your relational structure a pipeline or a platform?
- Are structures passive (program-focused) or active (participatory)?
- Do your structures facilitate spiritual maturity and leadership development?
- Are people equipped for their God-given vocation?

---

## Resources: Designing Operational Structures

Resource structures encompass budgets, calendars, operational systems, and physical facilities. The challenge is to build *minimum viable structure*—sufficient for health, but avoiding bureaucracy or fragility.

Budgets and calendars are theological documents—revealing true values. Physical buildings, as Churchill noted, shape and then are shaped by those who use them.

**Questions for Leadership Teams:**

- What minimum structures are needed for your mission?
- Do physical facilities express your paradigm and core values?
- Do costs constrain your mission?

---

## Results: Designing Measurement Structures

Measurement structures ensure organizations track what matters for mission. Historically, churches have measured attendance, budgets, and buildings. Movemental organizations, instead, track transformation and mission impact.

**Common Movemental Metrics:**

- Number of disciple-makers equipped
- Relationships with the non-Christian community
- Leaders and church planters launched
- Partnerships formed
- Community impact (e.g., reductions in crime, increased community services)

**Questions for Leadership Teams:**

- Have you defined a clear "win"?
- Are your metrics aligned with your mission and paradigm?
- What are you trying to scale? Is it working?

# The Critical Importance of Platform

Getting the platform right—culture and structure—informs and supports every aspect of discipleship and mission. It is the core infrastructure shaping both people and outcomes.

---

# Practices: Engaging the Collective Will

> "We shape our tools and then our tools shape us."  
> — **Marshall McLuhan**

> "In short, if you are what you love, and love is a habit, then discipleship is a rehabituation of your loves. This means that discipleship is more a matter of reformation than of acquiring information."  
> — **James K. A. Smith**

> "Sow a thought and you reap an action; sow an act and you reap a habit; sow a habit and you reap a character; sow a character and you reap a destiny."  
> — **Ralph Waldo Emerson**

> "If one of our orthodox beliefs has no corporeal value, if we cannot come up with a single consequence it has for our embodied life together, then there is good reason to ask why we should bother with it at all."  
> — **Stanley Hauerwas**

## The Metanoia Journey Continues

- **The Seed / Mind:** Mental Map + DNA  
- **The Tree / Soul:** Culture  
- **The Forest / Will:** Rhythms + Tools (Structures)

As we progress, we shift our focus to *Practices*. With Mind and Soul addressed, we now engage the Will of the organization through the establishment of Rhythms and Tools.

### Strengthening Organizational Willpower

A useful metaphor for platform design is hosting a dance: while leaders can structure the dance-floor, stage, sound system, and set the culture, they cannot force participation—they can only create an inviting environment, teach, and cultivate a love for dancing.

Translating theory into participation is the crucible of organizational transformation. As Alan has observed, true learning often comes not by **thinking our way into acting**, but by **acting our way into new thinking**.<sup>2</sup>
