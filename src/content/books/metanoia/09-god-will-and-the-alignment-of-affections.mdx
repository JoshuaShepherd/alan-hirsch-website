# God, Will, and the Alignment of Affections

God is a function of will, and orthopathy involves engaging our affections and passions, aligning them with the One God. This is fundamentally an engagement of the soul. For a more thorough exploration of what we call a biblical epistemology, or way of knowing, see:

- Hirsch and Frost, *ReJesus*, 143–53
- Hirsch and Hirsch, *Untamed*, 64–68
- Willard, *Renovation of the Heart*, 47

> *That is why we have the biblical teaching that human good and evil are, in the end, matters of the heart. Freedom is therefore directly related to the human capacity for sin and rebellion. Response and responsibility, obedience and choice, are the basis of monotheistic religion.*  
> —Kay, *Theological Aesthetics*, 1–2

Kay further explains:
> “By rooting the senses in itself the heart makes all sensual activities into acts of the whole human. The senses are a person’s opened heart. The eye, for instance, is the openness of the whole man to reality insofar as it is form and light. This integration of the mind’s vision with the eye’s vision is effected not only by their common agent, the heart, but also by their common object, Being.”

# Avoiding Reductionism: Intellect, Will, and Experience

Many Christians and churches tend to emphasize a theology of experience that fails to integrate the intellect and the will. Von Balthasar observes:

> “Many aberrations of the theology of experience and of life throughout history derive in every case from the fact that feeling is too exclusively thought of as an isolated act alongside the intellect and the will, and too little understood as the integration of the person’s whole life. Consequently, the criteria for the God-relationship are based too exclusively on individual emotional states and pay little attention to the event by which man’s total constitution and disposition, which are the foundation for everything else, can be experienced in and through individual emotional states. 

> The Scriptural arguments that oppose a pure theology of feeling lie ready to hand; but the very same arguments can equally be applied to defeat a theology that would attempt to establish man’s rightful relationship to God simply on isolated acts of faith and love, instead of anchoring it within man’s total disposition towards the living God.”  
> —Von Balthasar, *The Glory of the Lord*, I, 237

# Meta-Ideas: Primordial Concepts That Shape Movements

A meta-idea determines and shapes other ideas and thinking within an organization—a “primordial idea” or “cornerstone concept.” Change at this level changes everything. Identifying meta-ideas is critical for leveraging change throughout the organization.

If you are familiar with Alan’s mDNA model of movement, each of the mDNA elements are, in effect, meta-ideas. These include:

- **Jesus is Lord** (transcendent ideals that inform and motivate)
- **Discipleship and Disciple-Making** (system of recruitment and formation)
- **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** (extension of the organization into new ground)
- **APEST Culture** (ministry and leadership typology)
- **Organic Systems** (movemental and scalable organization)
- **Liminality-Communitas** (capacity for risk, innovation, and adaptive thriving)

Each of these offers powerful leverage throughout the organization.

In the church, _core theology_ constitutes meta-ideas that carry significant scriptural authority and necessity for faith. Culture creates the environment in which behaviors are legitimized, responsibilities are shared, and meaning and significance are transferred. This is vital, as it involves reinforcing the motivational passions that keep people aligned to the communal cause.  
See Hirsch, *The Forgotten Ways*, 202.

# Seeing, Perception, and Metanoia

According to Strong’s Concordance, the Greek word *horáō* means “to be able to see with the mind, to look upon, experience, perceive, discern.”

For additional resources and movements, see:

- [Movement Leaders Collective](https://www.movementleaderscollective.com)
- [The MX Platform](https://www.themxplatform.com)

Rob Wegner has developed learning cohorts to catalyze movements across cities, including work with the For Charlotte Network and the City Leaders Collective ([For Charlotte](https://www.forcharlotte.org)).

# Institutionalism and the Need for Adaptation

> “History amply shows, we prefer regularity and predictability and want to forgo the perils of adventure in exchange for a more manageable experience of life, especially in institutions. Here, at least in part, lies the psychology behind institutionalism: all institutions, religious or otherwise, are designed to provide the safety of predictability achieved through ritual, dogma, and control through regulations, policies, the promise of reward, or the threat of discipline. That is not necessarily a bad thing. In many ways, this is the boon that institutions confer on us: by providing regularity, recognizability, and ritual, they relieve us of having to incessantly develop new ways of doing things.”  
> —Alan Hirsch and Tim Catchim, *The Permanent Revolution*, 185

This insight is attributed to British missiologist J. V. Taylor, though the reference cannot be properly sourced. Stoicheia—the elemental spirits or elements in Galatians 4:3, 9; Colossians 2:8, 20–22—represent spiritual powers associated with religious tradition and are a real issue in organizational change, especially in religious contexts.

# The U-Shaped Journey and Hero’s Journey in Organization

The U-shaped journey appears in New Testament doctrines such as Christ’s self-emptying (*kenosis*), incarnation, recapitulation, restoration of all things (*apocatastasis*), suffering (*pathos*), and theosis (union with God).  
See chapter five of Hirsch, *5Q*, for elaboration.

- [Wikipedia: Hero’s Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey)
- Pat Purdue, “The Hero’s Journey: How To Tell Your Personal Brand Story In A Captivating Way,” [Forbes Magazine, January 6, 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/01/06/the-heros-journey-how-totell-your-personal-brand-story-in-a-captivating-way)
- Otto Scharmer, *Essentials of Theory U*, (San Francisco: Berrett Koehler, 2018)

**Liminality** refers to the quality of danger, disorientation, marginalization, or threat that precipitates a learning journey—a transitional, threshold experience.

### Scriptural Example of Liminality

> “And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal. And he said to them, ‘Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics. And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart. And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.’ And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.”  
> —Luke 6–9:1 (RSV)

The SWAT team slogan, “Just before engaging real danger in a raid,” (S.W.A.T. season 1, episode 4, “Radical,” directed by Greg Beeman) captures the essence of liminality.

# Perception, Paradigms, and Paradigm Shifts

Robert Pirsig (*Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, 102) and Abraham Heschel (*The Prophets*, Vol. 1, xxiv–v) both make the case for the necessity of seeing and understanding anew:

> “Insight is a breakthrough, requiring much intellectual dismantling and dislocation. ... Paradoxically, insight is knowledge at first sight.”

Thomas Kuhn, in *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, describes how paradigm change begins with recognition of anomalies in the prevailing paradigm, leading to the formation of new paradigms through collaborative reflection and problem-naming.

See also Margaret J. Wheatley, *Leadership and the New Science*, for extended discussion on the implications of paradigm shifts.

Alan Hirsch’s *The Forgotten Ways* explores the six elements of mDNA (movement DNA).

# Creativity and Divergent Thinking

Quoting Eberhard Arnold in Clare Stober, “Retooling the Plough,” divergent thinking is contrasted with convergent thinking. Divergent thinking is the process of generating creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions, using familiar materials in unfamiliar ways—essentially non-linear logic.

For more on imaginative thinking, see Appendix Five.

# Change, Leadership, and Culture Creation

When seeking organizational transformation, not all members need to be involved at every stage. Key leadership (~5%) should be engaged early in paradigm and mental mapping, broader leadership (~15%) in culture creation, and everyone (~80%) at the practices level.

This can be illustrated by the analogy of a seed (paradigm/DNA), tree (organism/platform), and fruit (practices), where the potential for a whole forest resides in the original seed.

See UNICEF, “World Urbanization Prospects 2018”

# Meta-Ideas in Science and Organizational Change

The American Association for the Advancement of Science recognizes meta-themes—ideas transcending disciplinary boundaries:

- Patterns
- Cause and Effect
- Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
- Systems and Systems Models
- Structure and Function
- Stability and Change

For more, see [A Framework for K–12 Science Education](https://www.nap.edu/read/13165/chapter/8).

Peter Senge, in *The Fifth Discipline*, highlights how tacit mental models and paradigms often block organizational innovation.

# Distributed Leadership and The APEST Model

A remarkable, and often-overlooked, aspect of New Testament ecclesiology is the distribution of essential functions through the APEST typology (Ephesians 4:1–16):

- **Apostolic** (missional/entrepreneurial)
- **Prophetic** (aligning function)
- **Evangelistic** (recruitment and buy-in)
- **Shepherding** (human resources)
- **Teaching** (instruction and wisdom)

This ministry “is given to all believers” (Eph 4:7), democratizing agency throughout the body.

Bob Johansen, *The New Leadership Literacies*, argues for shifting from centralized to decentralized structures, distributing authority in line with responsibility. See also Wegner, Ford, and Hirsch, *The Starfish and the Spirit*.

**Note:** Here, “democratize” is used in its literal, not political, sense: to spread throughout all people in an organization. Scripture reflects this tension between self-elevation (Babel, Genesis 11) and the democratization of Spirit (Pentecost, Acts 2).

Organic Systems—an mDNA principle—combat individualism and foster authentic community, reflecting Jesus’ design for the church and the nature of God.

# Practices as Expressions of Paradigms

Our practices do not arise in a vacuum; they visibly express what we value and believe, as well as our worldview and self-understanding. They are embodiments of our paradigms and culture.

**The Golden Rule of Habit Change:**  
If you keep the initial cue, replace the routine, and keep the reward, change will eventually occur—though belief in the process is essential for long-term success.  
See Charles Duhigg, *The Power of Habit*.

Repeated actions create neural pathways—muscle memory—leading to procedural memory and eventually to automaticity, found in activities like sports, musical instruments, and everyday motor tasks.

# Algorithms, Design Thinking, and Innovation

Developing a unique organizational algorithm is vital—resources include:

- [Eric Ries, Lean Startup Methodology](https://theleanstartup.com/principles)

# Community, Belonging, and Perichoresis

Community dynamics, intimacy, and belonging models (Edward T. Hall; Joseph Myers, *The Search to Belong*), as well as practical missional habits (Michael Frost, *Surprise the World*), all tie into the deeper, Trinitarian concept of **perichoresis**—the divine dance of the Father, Son, and Spirit.

> “The Trinity is, so, an eternal dance of the Father, Son, and Spirit sharing mutual love, honor, happiness, joy, and respect, and living an eternal relationship of self-giving. ... Through this never-ending dance, the divine persons exist so intimately with one another, for one another, and in one another, that they constitute a single, unique, and complete unity by themselves.”  
> —Katarína Pavelová, “Perichoresis—The Divine Dance of the Trinity,” *Vivat Deus*

# Always Reforming: The Call to Constant Adaptation

> “One of the best ‘formulas’ to emerge from the Reformation was *semper reformanda*, which maintains that the church cannot rest on its current formulations and expressions; that we never arrive at the perfected form of ecclesia; that we must always be re-form-ing. This commits the church to constant adaptation—something we have all-too-seldom done, despite it being formulated over five hundred years ago. Most denominational expressions are deeply entrenched in now outdated paradigms and formulations.”  
> —Willem Vanderburg, quoted in Mandy Smith, *Unfettered*

# Imagination, Love, and Renewal

> “But just as love is not overcome by the everyday routine, but uses its imagination in a thousand ways to transfigure it, fashioning each day anew in small details, so it is with contemplation. Every day I am privileged to appear before the God who is eternally young, who never ages; God’s meadows bloom as brightly and in as many colors as ever, and man’s inner receptivity is renewed every day, provided that he makes use of it. ... He only has to pull himself together and shake off whatever is oppressing him and dragging him down. All he has to do is give it over and begin again.”  
> —Von Balthasar, *Prayer*, 139

Albert Einstein reflected:

> “The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.”  
> —Albert Einstein, [Wish I’d Said That](https://wist.info/einstein-albert/6414/)
