# The Dynamic Heart: Soul, Will, and the Journey of Metanoia

## The Soul in Scripture and Human Experience

In Scripture, the terms for “soul” (Hebrew: *nephesh*, *ruach*; Greek: *psyche*) possess a broad range of metaphorical meanings. Depending on the context, they can be translated as “soul,” “life,” “consciousness,” “person,” “appetite,” “desire,” “emotion,” “passion,” and so on. Importantly, the soul represents the animating principle of life—its “spirit”—and is sometimes used synonymously with the idea of spirit.[^15]

The soul is strongly associated with *pathos*: those aspects of human life that enthrall—eros, empathy, compassion, and sympathy. The soul is the seat of the restless yearnings of the human heart: passion, desire, and the search for truth, integrity, meaning, and salvation. These yearnings drive and motivate our greatest endeavors. As Augustine understood, the psyche is mysteriously drawn to the infinite; it is the soul that senses and responds to the sacred within all things. Thus, all great art is generated from the soul.

Furthermore, the soul is linked with the senses, forming the basis of our primary experience of the world—that part of us that hears, tastes, feels, and sees.[^16] When the senses are properly rooted in the heart, life resonates more fully, as all sensual activities become deeply personal acts of the whole human.[^17] Humans experience peak moments when all the senses are engaged—whether in genuine lovemaking, or when encountering beautiful art, music, or nature.

James Hillman, a psychologist concerned with the nature and dynamics of the soul, observes that the soul generally lies hidden behind routines, dogmas, and fixed beliefs until it is awakened during moments of crisis that break routine. For Hillman, the soul is the "imaginative possibility of our nature"—realized in speculation, dream, image, and fantasy.[^18] Clearly, our dreams and imagination function from our psyche, or soul.

### The Motive Power of the Soul

Eighteenth-century preacher and theologian Jonathan Edwards sought to articulate “the religious affections” as part of a theology of the soul. In his famous treatise, Edwards maintained:

> "I am bold in saying this, but I believe that no one is ever changed, either by doctrine, by hearing the word, or by the preaching or teaching of another, unless the religious affections are moved by these things … In a word, there is never any great achievement by the things of religion without a heart deeply affected by those things … True religion is placed in the affections."[^19]

Soulfulness can be cultivated when individuals and communities live out their values and beliefs, demonstrating sensitivity to God and his purposes in the world. To “have soul” is to live from the inside out—where outward life is consistent with inward reality. It is to wear your heart on your sleeve, to act with integrity, presence, and gravitas. As some traditions hold, true love allows the soul of a person to envelope their body—hence saints are often depicted with auras or halos.[^20]

Our heroes in the faith are invariably those who have lived their message with soul. Organizations that possess soul exhibit a distinct personality—a vibe, a mood. They too wear their beliefs externally. A soulful church, therefore, reverberates with the presence of Jesus; it can be tangibly felt and directly experienced.

Activating the soul is essential for wholehearted, lasting, *metanoic* transformation. Without the soul, we risk being soulless, half-hearted at best, heartless at worst. True transformation requires passion and commitment; our hearts must "be in it."

> It is not revolutions and upheavals
> That clear the road to new and better days,
> But revelations, lavishness and torments
> Of someone’s soul, inspired and ablaze.[^21]

The passionate pursuit of a goal alters the very structure of reality.

## The Will and Decisiveness

Understanding the will, biblically, is comparatively straightforward. While mind and soul may operate at the level of unconscious yearning, the will is more readily evident. Each day, we feel the impact of our own choices, as well as those made by others—acts of kindness, decisions to love or serve, or, conversely, the negative consequences of self-centered choices. Ideological politics serve as a contemporary example of the potency of will across societies and history.

As Dallas Willard notes, will or choice involves the capacity of a person to originate things and events that would not otherwise exist.[^22] This creative ability arises from human freedom and lies at the heart of all creativity.

**To be human before God requires:**
- Responsibility
- Direction
- Choice

To choose God is to align your will with His. This capacity is intrinsic to our creation in God’s image. Yet, as Augustine called it, the “dreaded gift of free will” is both a door to possibility and a potential instrument of havoc.

The will enables proactivity, initiation, creation, and bringing forth the new. However, passivity or indecision also pose dangers. Sins of omission can be as serious as sins of commission. Some theologians deem laziness (*acedia*) and decisionlessness to be the roots of sin.[^23] As Martin Buber argues, indecision coupled with directionlessness lies at the root of our problems with evil.[^24] Passivity plays a role in psychological malaise and can be the doorway to demonic oppression and bondage when we repeatedly misuse our will.

Thus, true repentance—transformative change—requires definitive willful action, strategic planning, and proactive choices, both personally and corporately. It is by exercising our wills that we co-create futures and witness the coming of God's kingdom where His will is done.

## The Symphony of a Whole Heart

The three-dimensional model of the heart is evident in Israel’s Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4–9) and Jesus' summation of the Law:  

> “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength [will].”  
> — *Mark 12:30*[^25]

In integrating the dimensions of heart—soul, mind, and strength (will)—in what we call **wholeheartedness**, we can truly love and worship the One God.[^26] Omission of any component makes true love and deep *metanoic* transformation impossible.[^27]

### Wholeheartedness in Christian Tradition

Throughout history, Christian traditions have sought to frame prayer, worship, and practice as offerings of mind, will, affection, and even body.[^28] The human heart—comprising mind, soul, and will—is the executive center of life.[^29] It is where intention becomes action, where intellect, passion, and decision converge:

> “The heart is where decisions and choices are made for the whole person. That is its function.”[^30]

Because the heart unites intellect, will, emotions, and senses, it bridges body and mind—fundamental to perception. Feelings, as the integrative activity of the heart, constitute neither an inferior nor a separate faculty, but rather, the fullness of our humanity.[^31] Each dimension presupposes and supports the others.

**Key Principle:**  
The more we integrate mind, soul, and will, the more we experience a transformed, *metanoic* heart—aligned with God’s purposes. Conversely, fragmentation yields dysfunction.

---

## The Pain of a Broken Heart

A broken (divided) heart, unable to bring its whole self to bear, underlies our broken lives and systems. When at least one essential dimension of metanoic transformation is missing, confusion and inability to integrate follow.

> Like a body whose core functions are at odds, the half-hearted or double-minded person or organization is out of sync, working against itself and tearing itself apart.

For example, members of Alcoholics Anonymous must deeply desire change—wholeheartedly—to succeed. Without an integrated mind, soul, and will, radical change is impossible, whether for individuals or institutions.

Organizations entrenched in outdated thinking and practices require all three dimensions of their "corporate heart" to experience genuine *metanoia*.[^32]

**Case Example:**  
Christine Caine, founder of various ministries, exemplifies wholeheartedness—radically open to transformation, exceptionally thoughtful, and strategically active. Her impact arises from the integration of mind, soul, and will.

### Lessons from Women

In many instances, women demonstrate a greater ability to integrate heart, soul, and will, avoiding the compartmentalization that often limits men.[^33] For example, the woman who anointed Jesus participated with her whole person, and Jesus praised her over the detached religious elite.

A colleague noted that weeping—the shedding of tears—often integrates all aspects of the heart (and brain). Personal moments of deep transformation are frequently accompanied by tears.

Conversely, fragmented individuals—whether passionate but unwise, overly theoretical, or excessively willful—struggle to effect positive change.

**Churches may fall into similar patterns:**
- "Mind-churches" lacking heart
- "Soul-churches" neglecting reason
- "Will-churches" relying on sheer effort

Without integration, congregations may become unloving, unwise, or uncommitted. We need all dimensions together for true transformation.

## A Model of Wholehearted Change

To support *metanoic* transformation, MLC has developed a model framing change through "mind-power," "soul-power," and "will-power."

### Mind Power
- Pursuit of foundational "meta-ideas" that shift thinking.
- Discern and unlearn outdated concepts; commit to continual learning (e.g., through book clubs, engaging thought-leaders, asking questions).
- Remember: “Disciple” (*matheiteis*) means learner—lifelong growth is non-negotiable.

### Soul Power
- The soul of an organization is felt as its culture or vibe.
- Attend to unseen cultural elements: values, language, symbols, ethos.
- Foster resonance by making core values beautiful, artful, and emotionally compelling.

### Will Power
- Overcoming passivity and indecision is critical.
- Set strategic goals, be accountable, and develop resolve.
- Obedience and willful, transformative action are required, both individually and collectively.

---

## Assessing and Cultivating Wholeheartedness

Assess the relative strength of mind, soul, and will—both personally and organizationally. Address weaknesses rather than doubling down on strengths.

1. **Evaluate yourself (1–5) on each dimension.**
2. **Evaluate your organization on the same scale.**
3. **Compare results:** Are your strengths/weaknesses mirrored? What can you do to improve areas of weakness?
4. **Plan concrete steps**: How can you recruit, collaborate, or grow in deficient areas?

---

## The Undivided Heart

Unification of the heart toward God is the foundation of the biblical worldview.  
> “Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God.”  
> — *Matthew 5:8*

To be pure of heart is to be undivided, focusing all of life (soul, mind, strength) on the One God, not on idols or ideologies.[^39][^40] Wholeheartedness—corporate and individual—is essential to *metanoia*, and in turn, essential to genuine knowledge of God.

Eugene Peterson’s translation speaks poignantly:
> “You’re blessed when you get your inside world—your mind and heart—put right. Then you can see God in the outside world.” (Matthew 5:8, MSG)

## The Metanoia Journey: Transforming Organization and Self

MLC exists to help churches and Christian organizations become more movemental and transformational. The *Metanoia Journey* process is integral: transitioning from paradigm shift and re/learning, to alignment with the mind of Christ, to wholehearted change.

### Overview of the Journey

- **Ch. 6:** *Un/raveling* and unlearning
- **Ch. 7:** *Paradigm shift*: Conscious clarity, mental models, and DNA
- **Ch. 8:** *Platforms of Change*: Culture and structures
- **Ch. 9:** *Practices*: Habits, algorithms, and organizational life

The full details and tools are supplied in the associated workbook and MLC coaching. This overview provides the conceptual scaffold.

Metanoia—embraced as both individual and corporate process—is essential for ongoing growth as disciples and as communities. If adaptive change is not programmed in, we end up reinforcing the status quo rather than pursuing God’s dynamic calling.

Organizations, especially long-standing ones, become more institutional and resist change over time. In the turbulent (“VUCA”) context of today, the ability to adapt is absolutely critical to organizational survival.

---

## The Way of Unlearning

Humans and organizations resist change because current systems stabilize and benefit insiders. Existing paradigms easily become mental and spiritual prisons.

Transformation begins with unlearning—often more critical than new learning—hence the biblical themes of "conversion" or "repentance." Spiritual warfare plays out as ideologies, traditions, and oppressive patterns. The elemental *stoicheia* become powers when our allegiance gives them meaning; religious institutions can become laden with such patterns.

> "Leaders seeking to restore missional focus must exercise great spiritual discernment and prayer, for this struggle is not merely human but spiritual."  
> — *Ephesians 6:12*

---

## The U–Curve: Learning and Change

Transformation follows a U-shaped curve—in personal development and organizational change. It requires descent (unraveling and unlearning) before ascent (relearning and reframing).

### The Hero’s Journey and Metanoia

Like the archetypal hero’s journey (Campbell's monomyth), the *Metanoia Journey* traverses the valley of crisis before emerging into new life. This U-pattern is seen in the lives of biblical heroes—and supremely, in Jesus’ own journey through incarnation, death, and resurrection.

---

## The Stages of Metanoia

### The Downcurve (Unlearning)

1. **Unravel:**  
   Become aware of paradigmatic issues, systemic dysfunction, and embrace the adaptive challenge.
2. **Uncover:**  
   Roam the mind with “soft eyes”; sense systemic flaws, movement blockers, mourn unfaithfulness.
3. **Unlock:**  
   Explore new frontiers, imagine possibilities, foster spiritual receptivity, move from narrow to open thinking.
4. **Understand:**  
   Reformulate paradigms, identify meta-ideas, seek order within chaos.

### The Upcurve (Relearning and Building)

1. **Paradigm:**  
   Reformulate the mental map and DNA of the organization.
2. **Platform:**  
   Establish soulful culture and scalable structures.
3. **Practices:**  
   Codify rhythms and tools for reproducibility.
4. **Perform:**  
   Scale learning, sustain cultural health, and refine systems for future growth.

**Key Insight:**  
To realize change, the crisis must be engaged with the whole heart (mind, soul, will). Only then can it activate a robust search for new ways of thinking and acting.

---

## Facing Wicked Problems

"Wicked problems"—complex, interconnected challenges—often demand adaptive change. These can present as existential crises or as opportunities. Grappling with them should spark the unlearning process, leading to paradigm shifts and new organizational platforms.

**Questions for Leaders:**
- What systemic vulnerabilities does a current crisis reveal?
- Are we willing to interrogate our own leadership role in the problem?
- Are we willing to disrupt the status quo (even financially) to seek genuine change?

**Unraveling reveals the anomalies in the system—the “splinters in the mind.”** Initiating curiosity sets the stage for new perspectives and solutions, echoing scientific paradigm shifts such as the transition from Newtonian to quantum physics.

---

## Meta-Ideas: The DNA of Organizations

Identifying and aligning “meta-ideas”—foundational concepts that shape practice—is essential for deep change. In MLC's model, six meta-ideas provide the DNA for movemental church:

1. Jesus is Lord
2. Discipleship and Disciple-Making
3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse
4. APEST Culture (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher)
5. Organic Systems (decentralized, reproducible structures)
6. Liminality and Communitas (risk, adventure, and camaraderie)

Alignment among these produces an emergent, movemental system. Misalignment undermines mission.

### Force Field Analysis

Assess whether forces in your organization are acting as **Boosters** (for change) or **Blockers** (against change) in relation to each meta-idea.

---

## Conclusion

A dynamic, integrated heart—wholehearted in mind, soul, and will—anchored in Christ, is the starting point for genuine transformation, both personally and organizationally. The *Metanoia Journey* invites leaders and organizations to descend into the valley of unlearning, confront their deepest patterns, and ascend into renewed mission and identity.
