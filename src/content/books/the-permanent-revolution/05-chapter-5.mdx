---# Dynamics of Missional Leadership: APEST Functions in Practice

## Prophets Leading Missional Communities

Prophetic-led groups are often radical, placing the highest demands on their members. If you encounter a group in a challenging urban context, engaging in constant discussion about permanent revolution and actively reclaiming the city through their presence, that is likely a group with strong prophetic leadership. These groups may grow by multiplying; however, they often retain a core team while enabling new initiatives to branch off into different contexts.

## Evangelists Leading Missional Communities

Evangelists are drawn to people of peace—those whom God has especially prepared to receive the gospel and who act as gatekeepers to wider networks (see Luke 9–10, Mark 6, Matthew 10). They build relationships, using these connections to reach broader neighborhoods. Evangelists often seek to hand off their group and move into new contexts or send pairs to start similar work elsewhere.

## Teachers Leading Missional Communities

Teachers frequently enter contexts where the Christian witness is struggling or nearly extinguished. They model how to live the Christian life through worship, community, and mission. Mature teachers approach this humbly; much of their work hardly feels like formal teaching. While they often stay for extended periods, many eventually seek new contexts for their ministry and hand over their group to another leader. The new groups they send out are well-prepared with clear models to follow.

## Pastors Leading Missional Communities

Pastors aim for community transformation by establishing and nurturing long-term relationships. They highly value the integrity that comes from becoming fully embedded in their context, which leads to a slower and more prolonged approach to mission. This model tends to work especially well in suburbs. Relationships are central to everything they do, making rapid multiplication challenging; however, pastors often succeed in growing small groups and may expand their efforts to neighboring areas or streets.

## Apostles Leading Missional Communities

Apostle-led communities often revolve around individuals who can gather and attract others. Such groups are innovative, pushing into new missional frontiers and frequently experiencing rapid growth. Their approach to multiplication is often to divide the group, sometimes necessitated by the pressures of expansion. Mature apostles can manage these transitions, although multiplying a missional community can be relationally complex.

> When you gather specific ministry groups and offer training, deployment, and coaching through the lens of mission, spectacular things begin to happen. People who have been trained to lead in alignment with how God has uniquely shaped them lead far more naturally.

Hundreds of churches are beginning to apply the APEST model (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) to great effect:

- **Christian Fellowship Church (Virginia):** Undertook a radical restructuring along APEST lines.
- **Northwood Church (Keller, Texas):** Bob Roberts Jr. implemented a similar restructuring. Each cell in the church engaged all APEST functions, reframing roles as core tasks. Members lead with their vocational strengths as needs arise. This novel approach has been described as revolutionary, unlocking previously untapped potential and resulting in increased church planting.

## Surfing the Edge of Chaos: Leading with the APEST Model

Leading a church with a full-fledged APEST model generates more energy than the traditional Shepherd-Teacher (ST) model. While diverse viewpoints can lead to conflict, well-managed conflict is often a source of creativity and innovation.

### A Model for Creatively Managing Conflict

Management expert Richard Pascale observes that highly innovative organizations face greater real and potential conflicts, but the successful ones harness this tension to generate outcomes. Pascale’s model aligns closely with the process described in Ephesians 4.

**The process involves moving between these poles:**

- **Fit:** Affirms the characteristics that hold the team together—love, respect, shared mission, and commitment (see Ephesians 4:1–6).
- **Split:** Legitimizes and embraces diversity of expression and calling within the team (see Ephesians 4:7–11).
- **Contend:** Encourages members to contribute their distinctive roles, promoting honest debate and dialogue (see Ephesians 4:15).
- **Transcend:** Collective agreement to move beyond disagreement, seeking unity and maturity in Christ (see Ephesians 4:12–16).

---

## APEST Thinking Hats

Inspired by Edward de Bono’s "Six Thinking Hats," this approach applies APEST perspectives to problem-solving:

- **White Hat:** Focus on data and information (What do we know? What’s missing?).
- **Red Hat:** Express feelings, hunches, and intuition (What do we feel about this?).
- **Black Hat:** Apply caution; identify risks and obstacles.
- **Yellow Hat:** Take an optimistic view; consider logical benefits and feasibility.
- **Green Hat:** Engage creativity; generate new ideas and alternatives.
- **Blue Hat:** Adopt a visionary, strategic perspective; consider the big picture.

**APEST Application:**
Assign each team member a "hat" representing an APEST role. As a team, work sequentially through each perspective (apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, teaching) to view a problem from all angles. This exercise encourages all team members to use aspects of each ministry function and results in more holistic solutions.

# The Importance of Apostolic Ministry

We conclude Part One with a focus on apostolic vocation, intelligence, and practices.

> In terms of the ministry and leadership of Jesus’s people, the apostolic is the permanent revolutionary needed to sustain the permanent revolution that is the ecclesia.

We argue that the apostolic is the most generative and catalytic of all the APEST ministries, both initiating and sustaining the church’s unending reformation and mission. While prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers all play essential roles, they function interdependently with the apostolic.

Activating APEST diversity requires a unifying force—typically provided by the apostolic ministry, which naturally cultivates missional focus and collective purpose.

> Without the unifying force of a common mission, APEST diversity drifts toward fragmentation.

The apostolic supports the emergence of communitas—a community formed around a shared challenge or task—acting as a catalyst for change without dominating or replacing the other APEST roles.

**Important Caveats:**
- Apostolic ministry is not hierarchical but rather "first among equals."
- APEST ministry must remain fivefold—not reduced to one or two roles.

# Part Two: Custody of the Codes  
## Mapping the Contours of Apostolic Ministry

> "The great Christian revolutions came not by the discovery of something that was not known before. They happen when someone takes radically something that was always there."  
> — H. Richard Niebuhr

> "One aim of missiology is a more adequate understanding of the apostolic task of the Church. There is no other way to retain continuity with the apostles than to keep on doing what they did."  
> — Carl E. Braaten

> "This Life’s dim windows of the soul  
> Distorts the heavens from pole to pole  
> And leads you to believe a lie  
> When you see with, not thro’ the eye."  
> — William Blake, *The Everlasting Gospel*

William Blake reminds us that truly understanding a movement requires openness to its "otherness." Advances in both science and theology depend on such openness—on revelation and radical seeing, especially at the core of ecclesial codes such as the apostolic.

### Key Questions

- Is contemporary apostolic vocation the same as that of Paul and the twelve, or is it different?
- What are the functions, qualifications, and roles of contemporary apostles?
- What are the implications for leadership, ministry, and organizational structure?

---

## Little "a" and Big "A" Apostles

Skeptics fear that contemporary apostles might replace or overshadow the original twelve. The reality, however, is clear: **The original twelve played a unique, foundational role, but ongoing apostolic functions have continued throughout church history.**

Every role in the APEST model draws from its biblical archetype. "Little 'a'" apostles (beyond the twelve) and other roles, like shepherds and teachers, should maintain continuity with scriptural precedents.

The assumption that the apostles’ primary role was to write the Bible is incorrect. The apostles were more than scribes—they were custodians, planters, networkers, and foundational leaders.

---

## Gifted and Empowered

Apostolic ministry is not merely a personality type or entrepreneurial gift; it is described in the New Testament as both a spiritual gift (charismata) and a vocation (kleseos). Apostolic ministry—like all Christian ministry—is fundamentally charismatic, flowing from the gifting of the Holy Spirit to all believers.

- **Apostolic succession** (as traditionally understood) is critiqued as it institutionalizes what should remain charismatic and Spirit-led.

Throughout this text, "apostle" is used more as a function and vocation—not as an institutional office. Apostolic calling, like other ministries, is recognized by the community and originates from the Spirit.

---

## Paul as Prototype

Paul’s letters, especially 1 and 2 Corinthians, offer metaphors that define apostolic ministry:
- **Planter:** Seeding the gospel in new contexts (1 Corinthians 3:6–8)
- **Architect:** Master builder and blueprint crafter, involved in both design and implementation (1 Corinthians 3:10)
- **Foundation Layer:** Lays a secure base for communities (1 Corinthians 3:10–15)
- **Father:** Spiritually nurtures and intervenes for his churches (1 Corinthians 4:14–21; 2 Corinthians)
- **Ambassador:** Represents the interests of the kingdom (2 Corinthians 5:16–21)

Other metaphors—custodian, partner, coworker, slave, aroma of Christ—enrich our understanding. Ultimately, the apostolic task is always missionary, aligning the church with the missio Dei (God’s sending mission).

---

## The Custodian of the Gospel

Paul describes himself as a "steward of the gospel" (oikonomia), responsible for:
- Safeguarding the value and integrity of the gospel within the church (1 Corinthians 4:1–2; Ephesians 3:2)
- Ensuring that the gospel is authentically transmitted and contextualized across cultures

> "Nothing is more closely associated with the ‘apostle’ than the ‘gospel.’ No apostle can separate his or her calling as apostle from their core purpose—to serve the gospel."  
> — John Schutz

This custodianship is not exclusive ownership but responsible stewardship.

### Core Functions of Apostolic Ministry

Literature on apostles (e.g., Mike Breen, David Cannistraci) lists diverse functions, such as:
- Pioneering and planting churches
- Overseeing and strengthening communities
- Developing leaders and ordaining ministries
- Imparting doctrine and maintaining theological integrity
- Networking and managing ministries

Apostolic ministry is best understood as a system in which all these functions combine synergistically.

---

## The Four Interrelated Functions of Apostolic Ministry

1. **Seeding the DNA of the Gospel and the Church by Pioneering New Ground**  
   Apostles are pioneers who carry the core "DNA" of the Christian movement into new contexts, planting and cultivating diverse expressions of ecclesia.
   
2. **Guarding the DNA of the Gospel and Ecclesia**  
   Apostles guard against mutations that threaten the integrity of the faith, addressing heresy and error, and maintaining faithful templates of ecclesia.

3. **Networking the Movement**  
   Apostolic ministry fosters interconnected movements—distributed, not centralized—held together by vision, purpose, and a "web of meaning" rooted in the gospel.

4. **Creating the Environment for Other Ministries**  
   Apostolic leaders create contexts in which prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching gifts emerge and flourish. Their catalytic role is foundational but not hierarchical.

---

## The Consequences of Excluding Apostolic Ministry

Excluding the apostolic function creates significant deficits:

- Without apostolic multiplication, growth remains additive and individualistic.
- Without apostolic action, the promised presence and authority of Christ is diminished.
- Without apostolic clarity, purpose and identity become murky.
- Without apostolic modeling, a culture of release and empowerment is lost, replaced with management and control.
- Without apostolic parenting, mentoring and leadership development falter.
- Without apostolic accountability, strategic questions are neglected.
- Without apostolic imagination, issues of scalability and reproducibility are not addressed.
- Without apostolic passion, the church becomes focused on survival rather than participating in global mission.

---

## Summary

The apostolic ministry serves as both the catalyst and environment for all other APEST functions, ensuring the church remains a generative, multiplying, and missional movement rather than a static institution.

> "The custodian both seeds and guards the theo-genetic codes of the church, and this helps generate and sustain movements as well as catalyze the incredible potential locked up in the ministry of Jesus’s church."

---

# Epilogue and Transition

> After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force. The movement is natural, arising spontaneously. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results.  
> — *I Ching*

> "My mission is to introduce Christianity into Christendom."  
> — Søren Kierkegaard

> "In the coming world, God will not ask me: 'Why were you not Moses?' Instead he will ask me: 'Why were you not Zusya?'"  
> — Rabbi Zusya

As we proceed, we will analyze the nuances of apostolic ministry and individual vocation, recognizing that personal history and divine calling together shape the impact and expression of each ministry.
