---# Apostolic Ministry: Understanding Pauline and Petrine Models

> "The Church must be forever building, and always decaying, and always being restored."
> — T. S. Eliot

Apostolic ministry, as observed in the New Testament and throughout the history of the church, is a dynamic and multifaceted function. Building on the insights of Dick Scoggins, this chapter explores the distinction between two significant paradigms: the Pauline and Petrine models of apostleship. This distinction has profound implications for the ways apostles conceive of themselves and fulfill their callings, especially in varying contexts.

## The Emergence of the Pauline–Petrine Distinction

We are indebted to Dick Scoggins for highlighting the functional difference between these two models of apostleship. Scoggins, who serves at the U.S. Center for World Missions and has extensive missionary experience among Muslim peoples in North Africa, noticed a significant shift in apostolic function when he transitioned from a pioneering context in Africa to engaging established Christian groups in Europe.

Turning to Scripture for clarity, Scoggins found insight in **Galatians 2:8–10**. In this passage, Paul explains how the apostolic council recognized the distinct callings: he and Barnabas as apostles to the Gentiles, and Peter (along with James and John) as apostles to Israel and the Jewish diaspora.

Scoggins observes:

> “So we see that there is an apostolic ministry to the unreached (the Pauline), but there is also an apostolic ministry to the existing people of God (the Petrine). For me the clincher was that Jesus is ... the forerunner of both (Hebrews 3:1), but the bulk of His apostleship was to Israel.”

He concludes that while the model of apostleship is typically patterned after Paul the pioneer, much of the New Testament is actually concerned with achieving Petrine outcomes: reform, renewal, and revitalization of the existing church.

## Pauline and Petrine Apostolic Ministries

### Overlapping Functions

Apostolic ministry is never one-dimensional. It is nuanced by calling, personality, APEST profile, culture, context, and relationships. The distinction between Pauline and Petrine is an additional variable to consider. Not unlike the difference between being right-handed and left-handed, both share core functions — **custodian, guardian, networker, and translocal activity** — but exhibit unique strengths.

### Key Differences

- **Pauline Apostles** extend and establish Christianity on new ground, typically through pioneering, cross-cultural, and entrepreneurial methods.
- **Petrine Apostles** help reframe and revitalize the identity and mission of the existing church, primarily through innovative, reformational, and intracultural approaches.

---

## The Pauline Model: Cross-Cultural Pioneer Founder

Pauline apostles are called to pioneer among unreached peoples. Their ministry is characterized by movement, spiritual restlessness, and a passion for breaking new ground.

**Characteristics of the Pauline Model:**
- Extends the mission of the church: exploratory, founding, cross-cultural, entrepreneurial.
- Functions: custodian, networker, architect, guardian, translocal, meaning manager.
- Resists institutional constraints, thrives on the frontiers, and sustains commitment through union with Christ and the missio Dei.
- Produces profound theology rooted in experience and mission.
- Historical examples: St. Patrick’s missions to Ireland, the Celtic movement, and figures like Hudson Taylor and Roland Allen.

## The Petrine Model: Intracultural Visionary Architect

Petrine apostles focus more on the existing people of God, mobilizing and remissionalizing the established church.

**Characteristics of the Petrine Model:**
- Reframes the church’s identity and mission: refounding, intracultural, intrapreneurial.
- Rooted in missional discipleship, the Petrine apostle is tasked with feeding, equipping, and mobilizing the church to fulfill its vocation.
- Acts as a steward and custodian of organizational culture, unlocking ecclesial potential by drawing from internal resources.
- Works akin to a “tempered radical”—balancing conformity and revolution for ongoing change.
- More at ease with tradition and institutional frameworks, facilitating renewal from within.

### Modern Examples

- **Petrine Type:** Reggie McNeal, Tim Keller, Felicity Dale, Alan Roxburgh.
- **Pauline Type:** Neil Cole, Dave Ferguson, Ralph Moore, Erwin McManus.

## Pioneers, Miners, Networkers, and Mobilizers

Based on the Pauline–Petrine distinction and the explorer/catalyst dynamic, apostolic types can be further categorized:

| Type        | Model    | Orientation      | Function      |
|-------------|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Pioneer     | Pauline  | Explorer         | Cross-cultural risk-taker, church planter, boundary-crosser |
| Miner       | Petrine  | Explorer         | Uncovers and activates internal resources, addresses deep structures |
| Networker   | Pauline  | Catalyst         | Connects and broadens movements across regions; maintains translocal ties |
| Mobilizer   | Petrine  | Catalyst         | Operationalizes mission, refounds and remissionalizes established communities |

---

### Explorers: Movement Momentum

Both pioneers (Pauline) and miners (Petrine) are essential for maintaining and cultivating momentum within apostolic movements. Edgar Schein’s three levels of organizational culture — **the tangible, the theory, the thought world** — underscore how lasting change involves addressing deep assumptions and core narratives.

---

### Catalysts: Movements and Innovation

**Pauline Catalyst (Networker):**
- Establishes and sustains networks for the spread of the gospel.
- Functions translocally to plant, connect, and resource churches.

**Petrine Catalyst (Mobilizer):**
- Accelerates mobilization by rearticulating core theological truths.
- Helps the church become more creative, focused, and missional from within.
- Demonstrates relational, political, and organizational intelligence.

## Leadership Types and Apostolic Mix: APEST Correlations

Personality traits and the APEST fivefold ministry (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) influence apostolic leanings:

- **Pioneer:** Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist
- **Networker:** Apostle, Evangelist, Shepherd
- **Miner:** Apostle, Teacher, Prophet
- **Mobilizer:** Apostle, Shepherd, Evangelist

These roles are not rigid categories — most apostolic leaders function across all four, though with varying levels of intensity and effectiveness.

## Living from the Center: Apostolic Ministry and the Renewal of Christianity

> "To encounter God is to change. The Church must be forever building, and always decaying, and always being restored."  
> — T. S. Eliot

Scripture is replete with cycles of renewal, both corporate and personal. Without ongoing renewal, movements decline and die. Apostolic leaders often spur such renewal, especially during pivotal cultural transitions, such as the Celtic missions after the fall of Rome.

---

### Organizational Life Cycles and Leadership

Movements progress through identifiable stages, each requiring corresponding leadership:

1. **Courtship:** Formation
2. **Infancy:** Launch
3. **Go-go:** Rapid growth
4. **Adolescence:** Early establishment
5. **Prime:** Peak vitality
6. **Stability:** Plateauing
7. **Aristocracy:** Complacency
8. **Recrimination:** Internal questioning
9. **Bureaucracy:** Inward focus, decline
10. **Death:** Closure or absorption

**Key Leadership Roles (adapted from Lawrence Miller):**

- Prophet: Visionary initiator
- Barbarian: Leader through crisis/conquest
- Builder/Explorer: Developer of systems and skills
- Synergist: Maintains balance, unites diverse roles
- Administrator: Focuses on structure and security
- Bureaucrat: Imposes control, inhibits innovation
- Aristocrat: Detached, triggers disintegration

**APEST Correlations:**
- Early stages: Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists
- Peak and sustainability: Shepherds, Teachers
- Renewal and transformation: Petrine (synergists), with Pauline forms as initiators

---

## Center and Borderlands: The Cycle of Renewal

Renewal is dialectical—a dynamic movement between the spiritual center (deep encounter with God) and the borderlands (engagement with the world). Apostolic ministry operates at both:

- **Custodian:** Retains the living connection with God and gospel.
- **Frontier Agent:** Extends the mission of the church to new territory.

Apostolic leaders facilitate the church's return to its foundational calling, ensuring authenticity, vitality, and ongoing relevance.

---

## The Petrine Priority: Refounding and Revitalizing

Petrine apostles, through refounding, lead established communities to rediscover their original purpose and message. This process empowers and releases Pauline forms, resulting in a synergistic apostolic impact across the church.

> "The apostolic role within established churches and denominations requires reinterpreting the denomination’s foundational values in the light of the demands of its mission today... The ultimate goal of these apostolic leaders is to call the denomination away from maintenance, back to mission."
> — Steve Addison

**Examples of Petrine Renewal:**
- Pastoral Leadership Institute (PLi) in the Lutheran Church (Missouri Synod)
- FiveTwo Wiki—church planting and leadership development network

---

## Conclusion: The Mission Has a Church

The ongoing renewal of Christianity is tied to the health and presence of apostolic ministry in its Pauline and Petrine expressions. Apostolic ministry is not just about starting new movements but also about continually reforming, reviving, and propelling the church toward its missional calling. Without these functions, the ministry mix of the church is impoverished, and its ability to thrive diminishes.
