---liturgical life, offer pastoral care, and deliver teaching and that the mission of the church is secondary to these purposes (as is the commonly held view), then these functions set the agenda for how we organize ourselves. The net result is that we end up with an organization that deliberately prioritizes these more internally focused, service-oriented agendas and outcomes. The reality is that all organization involves the mobilization of bias; organizations embed a predisposition, a certain bent, into the social life of the community. It is because of this that in some deeply inexorable sense, we get in the end what we wanted even though it might not be all that God intended. The disturbing problem is that organizational bias is often at direct odds with the implicit motivations, as well as explicit purposes, of the God revealed in our Lord, Jesus Christ. By extension, the church that takes God’s mission as its organizing principle will be biased, that is, structurally predisposed, in favor of achieving that mission. The result is that it will inevitably look and feel different from the way we have historically tended to see the church in the West.2 movements r us 207 Mission as Organizing Principle Political scientist Elmer Schattschneider first defined organization as the mobilization of bias.3 What he meant is that we humans tend to organize ourselves in ways that help us actualize our latent or expressed values, interests, and aspirations. If this is true, then whether mission is at the forefront of our organization will be most clearly demonstrated in the way in which we organize ourselves. If mission is patently lacking in terms of outcome, then clearly we do not value it enough for it to inform our organizational bias. There is no way to evade this reality. As should be amply clear by now, when we talk about an apostolic church we are in effect calling the church to be a missional church, that is, a church that allows its missiology to determine and guide in the formation and understanding of its ecclesiology. In saying this, we are also implying that the church’s purpose and context will guide the cultural forms and expressions of the church in any given setting. In The Forgotten Ways, I (Alan) say it this way: “When the church is in mission, it is the true church. The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus. To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes in and through his people.”4 If evangelizing and discipling the nations lie at the heart of the church’s purpose in the world, then it is mission, and not ministry (to one another), that constitutes the true organizing principle of the church. In other words, the various functions of the church are best catalyzed by the missional one: “Experience tells us that a church that aims at ministry seldom gets to mission even if it sincerely intends to do so. But the church that aims at mission will have to do ministry, because ministry is the means to do mission.”5 When mission becomes the organizing principle of the church, it necessarily calls into question the prevailing forms and structures of our organizations. If we are honest, most of our organizations, while they may have initially started out as movements or support structures for mission, over time drift into a more ministry-oriented mode of existence. In pursuing an apostolic mode of organization, we are simply trying to put mission back into the basic equation of the church. If organization is the mobilization of bias, then apostolic organization is the mobilization of apostolic, or missional, bias. And the net result will be apostolic movement. This chapter explores the nature of movements and how to organize and lead them. 208 the permanent revolution Power to the People Again Movements are the quintessentially apostolic, missionally biased form of the church. Given that most movements start with grassroots missional engagement in a context generally far from the cultural epicenter of the established church, this statement ought not to be surprising. In fact, just about every Christian organization today started as a people movement of sorts. For instance, most of the orders, renewal movements, parachurch agencies, overseas mission organizations, and church planting movements started as movements. Even the origins of all the Protestant denominations (except perhaps the Anglican, unless one considers the demands of King Henry VIII for a divorce as starting a movement) fit this category. But the idea of organizing around movement need not simply apply to the beginning phases, as if it were some kind of preliminary scaffolding that ought to be dismantled as the church matures naturally into more institutional forms. Rather, if we believe that the church is in essence apostolic, then it ought always to retain and engender organizational forms that align with its missional purpose. Ecclesia ought always to be movemental to some degree, or it ceases to be the church that Jesus intended it to be.6 For more established institutional churches, becoming more movemental provides them with a way forward—a kind of back-to-the future approach to organizational development. It will mean recovering that which they have lost, like finding lost treasures in the church’s historical basement (or attic) where it has laid hidden, misplaced, or forgotten. Movement, and the possibility of it, is written into the genetic codes of the church. We have already observed that inserting apostolic bias into a plateauing or declining organization brings with it the possibility of sigmoid growth and renewal. If leaders continue following the logic implied in the apostolic approach, wholesale renewal will take place. Where apostolic imagination and influence are maintained throughout the life of an organization, they bring with them the kind of self-understanding that allows an organization to retain fluid and adaptive forms that allow movement to take place. For instance, a major Pentecostal denomination in Australia has maintained sigmoid growth over the long term, whereas the original denomination in the United States has been experiencing significant decline. They are the same in almost every way; the only significant difference between them is that the Australian wing has managed to maintain a sustained commitment to apostolic (and, by extension, movements r us 209 APEST) ministry. In the U.S. expression, the language of fivefold has largely fallen into disuse because of a history of various disputes about power and roles. An apostolic approach to organization will ensure that churches and organizations are inherently adaptive, flexible, self-renewing, resilient, learning, and intelligent. An apostolic movement takes its cue from the biblical teachings about the church as the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12; Ephesians 4:12–16), the living temple (1 Peter 2:4–5), the ecclesia as movement, as well as Jesus’s teachings about the organic nature of the kingdom of God. We must allow these metaphors and ideas to reframe the way we see God’s people as a movement. Taken together, they provide powerful, theologically substantial pathways to reimagine organization from an apostolic perspective. Our hope in the West lies in the recovery of a more fluid and dynamic apostolic imagination and practice. We have to be vigorous in recovering this understanding because the prevailing forms of organization dominate the way we think about church and organization. Apostolic movements require that we see church beyond its more institutional forms—as a movement of the whole people of God active in every sphere and domain of society. Seen through the lens of institution, the church will be conceived of as being primarily made up of its external forms and not its inner nature—as being made up of the combination of theological preferences, professional clergy, elaborate rituals, denominational templates, distinctive buildings, and the like. Clearly this is not what the New Testament itself means by ecclesia, and although it can be included within more movemental understandings, it is not what we mean by apostolic movement. We need a new influx of apostolic imagination to dislodge the hierarchical, machine-like metaphor that imbues our more inherited ecclesiologies and that has so captured our imagination. We have to think differently about how we conceive of ourselves if we are to see different results. The conventional way of thinking views the church as solid and static, the other as more fluid and dynamic. When we allow the apostolic, movemental way of thinking to reshape our idea of church, we begin to see the sheer transformational power of the church that Jesus designed—a church where each part in the system, be it individual disciple or community, has the full potential of the whole and therefore is intrinsically empowered to achieve what Jesus has set out for us to achieve. We begin to realize that, at least potentially, every believer ought to be considered a church planter and every church should be thought of as a church-planting church. Just as there is the full 210 the permanent revolution potential of a forest in every seed, so too is the task of leadership to help every disciple to be a movement in the making. In Jesus’s kingdom, everyone gets to play—even hookers, dodgy businessmen, and political insurgents—hardly what we would normally consider to be the A-Team, the cream of the leadership crop. Therefore, anything blocking the God-given agency of each disciple must ultimately derive from the Evil One. When we think this way, then we are thinking movementally, that is, apostolically. Conversely, if we are not thinking about ecclesia in this way, we are not seeing the church as the New Testament itself intends us to see it. In light of this, apostolic leadership recognizes that every member or group in a movement already has everything it needs to get the job done. They just need permission and empowerment to live into that truth. Rather than attributing more and more power to an increasingly centralized (centripetal) organization, movement dynamics require that power and function flow away from the center to the outermost limits, giving the whole movement a profoundly centrifugal feel. As Darin Land observes in his book The Diffusion of Ecclesiastical Authority, the leaders in the book of Acts took this very approach: “By consistently sharing their authority with others, these leaders allowed the diffusion of authority to new individuals rather than the concentration of authority in the hands of the few They were able to do this because their authority was based on deference and mutual honor, not only on legal rights. Thus, the diffusion of ecclesiastical authority resulted in a net increase of authority, which in turn propelled the growth of the church.”7 This is the very stuff of movements, and it is also underscored in current best-thinking books on organizations, including Peter Senge’s The Fifth Discipline, Dee Hock’s Birth of the Chaordic Age, Steve Addison’s Movements That Change the World, Bob Roberts’s Glocalization, Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom’s The Starfish and the Spider, Clay Shirky’s Here Comes Everybody, and Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams’s Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything.8 So let’s delve a bit further into movements, the most primal form of ecclesia. Andrew Jones, who blogs under the name of Tall Skinny Kiwi, did research to assess whether the current missional movement fits the characteristics of being a genuine movement. He asked a veteran Fuller church history professor, Paul Pierson, who provided those characteristics:9 movements r us 211 They always begin on the periphery of the institutional church. They are motivated by a transforming experience (grace) of God by an individual or group. The result is the desire for a more authentic Christian life that often leads to concern for the church and world. Face-to-face groups for prayer, Bible study, and mutual encouragement are important. New methods of selecting and training leaders become important. These are less institutional and more grassroots and lay oriented. There are theological breakthroughs, that is, rediscovery of aspects of the biblical message that have been forgotten or overlooked by the church; usually they focus on the gifts of every believer. Biblical concepts ignored by the traditional church but relevant to the hearers are often discovered. There is a leveling effect as distance decreases between clergy and laity, social classes, races, men and women, and denominations. The movement is countercultural in some ways, often because it reaches out to those who have not been valued by their society. Consequently there will be opposition by many in the dominant culture and church. There will often be manifestations of spiritual warfare. Such movements sense the reality of evil and the need to recognize the victory of Christ in the Cross and Resurrection. At times there will be unusual manifestations of the power of the Holy Spirit: healings, visions, speaking in tongues, miracles, and so on. More flexible structures of church and mission will be needed and often emerge, different from traditional structures. The movement will be led to significant recontextualization of the Christian message, which will be communicated more widely by laypersons to those outside the church. New cultural forms and art are often a characteristic. There will be a growing concern for those who are marginalized, often expressed in ministries of compassion. At a later stage, this often leads to concern for broader social transformation. As the movement matures, there will be concern for the renewal of the broader church. As the movement continues to mature, many will see themselves not only as part of the movement but as citizens of the kingdom of God, transcending their own movement. 212 the permanent revolution Every movement is less than perfect and often messy at the edges and sometimes the center. This is inevitable as long as sinful humans are involved. We might add more characteristics like clear thought leaders, differentiated culture and self-understanding, a strategy for leader training, and others. And although not all movements display all of these characteristics, they ought to be present to some degree.10 In pulling all these together in a cohesive model, we suggest that distinctly apostolic forms of movements have the following traits:11 Apostolic movements thrive in the atmosphere of belief. All movements breathe an atmosphere of “can do” or, perhaps even better, “will do.” Apostolic movements believe their message, see themselves as conduits of that message, and are willing to put their lives on the line to deliver it. They have a transformational vision for society, and a sense that they have a role to play in its transformation. They are believers. Apostolic movements exhibit the structure of networks. The favored structure of dynamic apostolic movements is that of the more fluid, decentralized, adaptive network where power and function are dispersed throughout the organization, even at its outer edges.12 To use a rather unfortunate comparison, the apostolic form will tend to look like the structure of an al Qaeda, where operatives, cells, and organizations are highly adaptive, easily reproduced, and hard to eliminate. More positive examples of dynamic networking in movements are the Apaches in the wars against the conquistadors, Alcoholics Anonymous, the women’s movement, and environmentalists. Clearly this was the form of the early church as well as that of early Methodism and the Chinese underground church, and, of course, the early church. Apostolic movements spread like viruses. All powerful ideas spread like viruses. They are in a real sense caught and passed on, and they do so in a viral, epidemical way. Apostolic movements that reach the power curve of exponential impact are in a real sense, pay-it-forward movements. They transfer ideas exponentially, and these ideas are profound enough to lodge themselves in people’s minds and change the way they think and act. For an idea to be spreadable, it needs to be simple enough for the audience to understand it. But to take root and transform the audience, it needs to be complex enough to carry a load of meaning. The rallying cry, “Jesus is Lord,” and the gospel itself carry both of these aspects within it. movements r us 213 Apostolic movements are reproducing and reproducible. Such movements are precommitted to multiplication formulas of growth and not simply addition. But the commitment to reproducing everything easily and rapidly implies a commitment to keeping things reproducible. For instance, evangelism, discipleship, leadership formation, ecclesiology itself, and church planting need to be relatively easily reproduced by any serious and committed agent (churches and individuals) in the system. (Because this is a major issue in organization, we explore this more fully in the discussion of four-self principles in the next chapter.) Further explorations can be found in On the Verge, Neil Cole’s Church 3.0, and Dwight Friesen’s Thy Kingdom Connected.13 We simply state these here because if leaders wish to move to a more apostolic approach to organization, it stands to reason that they need to (re)learn how they function and operate. To be a movement, we need to learn how to think like a movement, and then to act like a movement. The Starfish and the Spider A further aspect of highly transformative movements worth more exploration is the idea of decentralization and networking. Based on numerous examples of decentralized networks, ranging from Alcoholics Anonymous to Skype and Wikipedia, the authors of The Starfish and the Spider, Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom, present a model of decentralized organization and the new rules it implies.14 Perhaps the best way to describe the power of decentralized movements is to elaborate on the metaphor in the title of the book. In terms of organizations, a spider and a starfish might look the same (at least each has eight legs), but their organization are worlds apart. A spider that loses a leg might well be able to function. It might even be able to operate minus three legs, although its survival would be endangered if it lost four. However, it will die if it loses its head, because its central nervous system is located there. The starfish is a different animal altogether. Cut a leg off a starfish, and it grows back, and the leg that was cut off will actually grow into another starfish. Cut the starfish into ten pieces, and you end up with ten starfish. In other words, every element in its system has the full capacity to reproduce itself. If one observes what is going on in the book of Acts, one can easily discern that New Testament ecclesiology is more like the starfish than the spider. The same is true for the grassroots church in India, Church Multiplication Associates, and many other apostolic movements. 214 the permanent revolution Furthermore, on closer examination, movements are composed of many circles, or a fractal-like network of networks.15 Each circle is an independently functioning decentralized network consisting of autonomous and interdependent units. And these tend to lack the hierarchy or structure normally associated with centralized command-and-control organizations. Instead of normal hierarchy, people movements depend on ideas and beliefs to hold the system together and reach their objectives; they are built on a foundation of shared ideology. These beliefs are self-enforced by the various members of the movement. Knowledge and intelligence are deliberately spread throughout the organization. And because everyone is a stakeholder in the outcomes, there is a sense of reliance and trust throughout the community. Furthermore, because the organization is decentralized and intelligent, individual units in the movement adapt quickly to changes in their various environments and can advance and grow under the radar. In Brafman and Beckstrom’s view, leadership comes initially in the form of the catalyst, who either initiates a new circle or enhances an existing one.16 However, once the circle is up and running, the catalyst moves on, transferring active leadership to the members and the more socially cohesive leadership of the champion. Leadership does not exist to create dependencies in the members but rather for the full empowerment of the other members in pursuit of the movement’s goals. Think of Alcoholics Anonymous and Greenpeace here. If we relate this to APEST typologies, it is most likely the Pauline apostle who will initiate new movement, lay the foundations for its ongoing sustainability, and then move on to other frontiers. This makes space for the ministries of the Petrine apostles, prophets, and evangelists to step up to the fore and propel the movement forward, the evangelist in our view being the one most likely to fulfill the role of the champion. We see this taking place in Paul’s ministry when he leaves a church that he has planted and nurtured or sends Timothy to Ephesus and tells him to do the work of an evangelist. Although these characteristics are true for all kinds of people movements, they certainly describe the dynamics of apostolic movements as we find them in the Bible and in history. It is not hard to discern, for instance, that this is how the massively expanding movements of the contemporary developing world operate. Interestingly Paul explicitly considers himself to be an apostle, an evangelist, and a teacher (1 Timothy 2:7; 2 Timothy 1:11); in terms of starfish dynamics, this equals a combination of catalyst, champion, and original thinker in one person. Paul’s movements r us 215 contribution to the Christian movement signals precisely this form of catalytic influence, and it is still felt as powerfully today as it ever was. In the New Testament, though, we move beyond the somewhat twodimensional idea of leadership in The Starfish and the Spider to the fivefold APEST form, which easily incorporates the typology of catalyst and champion and integrates the more operative forms of shepherd and teacher as well. It is much more sustainable as a result. Truly New Testament ecclesiology is biased toward movements. Ending with the Beginning in Mind It is now common to hear the phrase that we must begin with the end in mind, and it is perfectly true for leadership as well as organizations. If you want apostolic movement, you must begin with a clear understanding of what this means or miss the mark entirely. This is exactly why builders need blueprints in order to build a skyscraper, or even a large house for that matter. But if we must begin with the end in mind, it is also true that we must end with the beginning in mind. To be genuinely apostolic, the basic organizational formulas factored into the initial movement should be sustainable over time and throughout the life of the organization. An apostolic algorithm should be consistent at front and back. The following are applications of this principle. Learn from the Fractal Apostolic organization is very similar to that of the fractal, “a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole.”17 When the basic unit is paired with the same shape, it grows accordingly but retains the characteristics of the original shape. The smallest part therefore is reflected in every part and throughout the whole. When a simple triangle multiplies on itself, a pattern emerges (Figure 10.1). This design can develop into infinite complexity and still be based on the initial formula.18 This fractal, one of the simplest, demonstrates the principle that is true to all fractals: the whole is made up of the recursion of the smallest part. What is remarkable is that the iterative and recursive design found in fractals is integral to many aspects of life itself. Neil Cole elaborates on this in his seminal book Organic Church.19 He rightly notes that fractals can, indeed must, apply to discipleship, leadership development, church planting and reproduction, and eventually into 216 the permanent revolution Source: From Organic Church: Growing Faith Where Life Happens by Neil Cole. (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2005). Reprinted with permission of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. movement extension itself: “The pattern remains the same no matter how many times it is multiplied. To have a leadership structure that grows with the body, we need to have a similar design that maintains its own integrity no matter how many times it is multiplied. Likewise, a global movement can be divided into smaller units that all maintain the same core formation.”20 The triangle in Figure 10.1 shows that no matter how far down you divide the shape, the original fractal design remains true. This can provide a pattern and direction for units exploding in a chain reaction, whereas the traditional organizational model cannot. That last phrase rings true for apostolic approaches to organization. Movements thrive on simplicity, reproducibility, and scalability. If you believe that discipleship is basic to what it means to be a church, put a clear pathway to discipleship in the process at the start. If you try movements r us 217 to factor this in later, it is very difficult and is unlikely to succeed. The same is true for leadership, multiplication, reproducibility, and so on. Again, if the initial model is not readily reproducible by the “nonprofessional” regular Christian, then it will not be magically reproducible by them later on. If it is built on a professional model of ministry and leadership (clergy), then that is what you will have to deal with all along the way, and at a great price. Get the base formula or algorithm right, pray like mad, and the rest will flow well. Plant Movements, Not Churches If you want to end with a movement, you need to start with a movemental idea and approach. This seems obvious, but all denominations started as dynamic movement, but because they were not attentive to the shifting issues of organization, they likely ended up in another place altogether. So plant movements, not churches. This is a big part of why it is important to begin with the end in mind: if you want a movement, you must think of ecclesia beyond the idea of a single local church before you begin. Once again, as every seed has the full potential for a tree and the tree the full potential of the forest, so too every church (indeed every believer) has the full potential of a movement in it. This is implied in the powerful slogan of an underground Chinese church movement: “Every believer is a church planter, and every church is a church-planting church.” Every believer has ecclesia (church) in him or her, and every ecclesia is responsible for the reproduction of others; in other words, they all make a movement. This approach is also useful in getting beyond distorted, highly institutionalized ideas of the church in order to focus on planting movements instead of planting churches. The distinctly apostolic form of thinking behind this is to think movements and not churches. Plant the Gospel, Not Churches Yet another way of beginning with the end in mind and ending with the beginning in mind is to plant the gospel, not churches. This does not cancel out what we said above; it simply changes the equation in a way that helps us think differently about the same task. One of the core tasks of apostolic ministry is to plant churches, but we are increasingly convinced that the term church planting itself is problematic. That is partly because we are never actually commanded to plant churches. In the Bible, that is always considered to be Jesus’s job; for our 218 the permanent revolution part, we are called to evangelize the world by making disciples (Matthew 28:18–20). But the phrase is also problematic because of associations with the word church in the cultural memory of the West. For Christians and non-Christians alike, the word church almost always conjures up the profoundly stylized images of buildings, clergy, rituals, and denominational templates. We have a very well-formed, or rather often misinformed, idea of what the church is and what it is all about. To get to the real heart of the Great Commission, we suggest that it might be useful to drop the phrase “church planting”; instead we should begin to focus on the approach of “gospel planting.” This is actually very useful because it takes us to the core of what missionary work is about in the first place: planting the message of Jesus and cultivating contextualized communities of faith that shape themselves around it. It involves a process that is Jesus focused and strong on incarnational forms of mission. As such it squares with the approach that it is Christology (the kingdom of God as it expresses itself in Jesus) that must directly shape our missiology (our purpose and mission in God’s world), which in turn must shape our ecclesiology (the cultural form and function of the church).21 Some years ago, Dee Hock, the brilliant founder of Visa Corporation, coined the word chaordic to indicate the kind of organization that manages to balance some kind of enduring structure at its center, which develops the strategic direction and maintains and enforces the movement’s core ideas and yet allows the kind of regional extension, scalability, and rapid-fire adaptability required to advance its cause. The word is a combination of chaos and order. This type of organization is what Hock calls chaordic—one that has a deeply held purpose and set of principles at the very center (these provide the order, the intellectual center, and the basis of decision making and operations) and yet also has high creativity at the edges (normally associated with chaos). See how this chaordic approach works its way out in these following statements: “Purpose and principle, clearly understood and articulated, and commonly shared, are the genetic code of any healthy organization. To the degree you hold purpose and principles in common among you, you can dispense with command and control. People will know how to behave in accordance with them, and they’ll do it in thousands of unimaginable, creative ways. The organization will become a vital, living set of beliefs.”22 And he says elsewhere, “An organization’s success has enormously more to do with clarity of a shared purpose, common principles, and strength of belief in them than to movements r us 219 assets, expertise, operating ability, or management competence, important as they may be.”23 Order and chaos, structure and creativity, find a perfect and productive balance in organizations of this kind. The Internet and many Internet-based organizations, Alcoholics Anonymous, Semco (Ricardo Semler’s companies), and Hock’s own Visa International are examples of organizations built squarely on chaordic principles.24 Hock’s ideas deserve serious attention: he has developed and led one of the biggest businesses in the world—one that has an annual turnover of $1.2 trillion, no headquarters, and only five hundred employees. Visa is truly a globally recognized brand that is organizationally invisible at the same time. This is no mean feat and well worthy of our study. As an advocate of living systems approaches to organization, Hock is describing something built into the rhythms and design of life itself as it applies to human organizations. This kind of chaordic organization is close to what we can see in the early church and other apostolic movements. Early Methodism, for instance, grew rapidly in spite of a lack of centralized organization and telephonic communications. Similarly, if one were to ask how the early church held together and expanded in a cohesive way in spite of having little that we take for granted as basic, one can answer only that the Holy Spirit chose to use something like what Hock calls chaordic principles. It had no central organization to speak of, no payroll, no denominational headquarters, and no executives. It held together based on adherence to the grand idea of Jesus as Lord, a call to live and extend his mission, and organized differently in different places. Chaordic principles, with their roots in living systems theory (with links to cosmology and how the Creator has designed things), their way of connecting community and an individual sense of purpose, their respect for human dignity, and their being deeply principled in nature offer us a nearly perfect approach to developing apostolic movements. They also capture well the concept of apostolic leadership and architecture that holds fast to the core DNA of the church while at the same time giving massive permission for ongoing cultural innovation, organizational adaptability, and missional extension. The original Jesus movement was chaordic, and that is exactly what is needed now. Whether one is working with an established church or starting a new one, chaordic approaches are relevant throughout the life cycle of the organization. So as far as the concept of a chaordic organization is concerned, apostolic movements tend to have the following characteristics: 220 the permanent revolution Are based on clarity of a theologically substantial sense of purpose, methodology, and principles Are self-organizing and self-governing in whole and in part Exist primarily to enable their constituent parts Are consistent with the kingdom of God Are powered from the periphery and unified from the core Are durable in purpose and principle and malleable in form and function Learn, adapt, and innovate in ever-expanding cycles Liberate and amplify ingenuity, initiative, and judgment Equitably distribute power, rights, responsibility, and rewards (“to each is given”; Ephesians 4:7) Harmoniously combine cooperation and competition Are compatible with human dignity and spirit in that the organization gives more than it takes Compatible with and foster diversity, complexity, and change Constructively use and harmonize conflict and paradox Changing the organizational self-understanding and culture needs time and a good process. Following similar principles, I (Alan) have sought to develop a thoroughly chaordic approach to developing apostolic movements in On the Verge, my book with Dave Ferguson.25 Here, we give a brief summary of the process laid out in significant detail there. To initiate and maintain movemental organizations requires a definite apostolic leadership vision as well as a keen sense of process. We suggest the following main parts of that process. IM AGINE . To be and become an apostolic movement, we have to have the right image and imagination of the organization. Apostolic imagination guides how we think about ecclesia and move on to imagining new possibilities. Imagination allows us to see the mission as Jesus sees it. Failure to capture the mind and heart of leadership at this point will mean frustration and failure in anything that follows. This highlights the importance of apostolic vision and leadership in helping people think differently about the church. SHIF T. Shift has three aspects: The process of embedding a core DNA at the very heart of the organization, one that is entirely consistent with apostolic movement paradigm. This means re/setting the organizational brain (or DNA, scripts, codes, or the like) to think apostolically about the church. movements r us 221 Recall the discussion of this earlier in this book and also in The Forgotten Ways: when the apostolic genius system (comprising the dynamic interplay between Jesus’s lordship, discipleship, incarnational mission, APEST, organic systems, and communitas) becomes the interpretive paradigm at the core of the organization, it will guide all subsequent thinking and acting throughout the organization.26 Developing an ethos and culture that are consistent with the paradigm and do not hinder its progress. It involves developing language and core values, identifying the heroes who embody the vision and values, along with coherent branding and communication, rituals and symbols, and missional metrics. Together this apostolic ethos creates the platform with which to develop the next stage. Developing sets of practices that shape and guide the members’ actions and rhythms. Most people, particularly nonleaders in the community, do not have to grasp all the conceptual ideas to be able to do it. In fact, simply doing certain well-constructed and rhythmic practices, woven into the fabric of the community and over long periods of time, changes people. INNOVATE. The need for genuine innovation arises as a natural outflow of the embedding of apostolic identity, ethos, and practices contained in the shift process. People need permission and skills to help the church or the movement generate new cultural forms and expressions of the kingdom of God. Everybody needs to innovate. MOV EMENTUM. Movementum can be defined as the process of gaining missional momentum until we birth an apostolic movement. It occurs when we are continuously taking our church through the preceding three stages: imagine, shift, and innovate. Developing a self-organizing, self-governing, trustworthy organization usually requires intensive effort. Taking the necessary time and not rushing it is important. During this time, a representative group of individuals (we call them the drafting team) is drawn from leadership in all parts and levels of the organization. Led by an apostolic person, they should meet regularly and work through the initial framing and implementation of the process. Then it is vital to identify all key stakeholders—people who are directly affected by changes and have much to lose or gain in the process. Invite the sharing of the concerns as well as their ideas. Do not limit this 222 the permanent revolution to top-level leadership. One of the best applications of this aspect of the process has been done at Granger Community Church in Indiana, where even its technical team is well informed about missional movement and how the leaders intend to get there. Everyone feels informed and in some way involved.27 Covering the Bases One of the gifts of thinking movementally about the church is that it gives us an idea of the church that encompasses and embraces the contributions of every part. Nothing is left out in the kingdom economy of church as Jesus designed it. For too long, the church has left the vast majority of players off the field. In a movement, as many as possible are activated. Every person, collective, church, and organization plays a part in the destiny of the whole. Seen in this way, the church contains incredible potential and latent capacity. Apostolic organization seeks to capture this intelligence and focus on the task set before it. To get this idea across, recently Dave Ferguson had members of Community Christian in Chicago who were willing to be missional in all of life to stand up, and he subsequently ordained them. They certainly got the message that they were all valuable and equal players in God’s kingdom. Movements tend to start with individuals, who together form into groups around a common cause and eventually mobilize for continuous movement by using ever more expansive levels of organization. In the words of living systems theory, ecclesia is a nested hierarchy consisting of an increasingly complex organization, much like Russian nesting dolls where each doll is encompassed by another doll, all the way to the outermost doll.28 In a nested hierarchy, each layer builds on the next, incorporating what precedes into what follows and never leaving anything behind. Even the smallest, apparently inconspicuous part of the system is an irreplaceable part of the whole. For instance, in New Testament ecclesiology, Paul insists we are all the body of Christ, and each one of us is a vital part of it (see 1 Corinthians 12:12–27; Ephesians 4:7–16). There is a deep and profound interdependence of each part—all of God’s people are chosen and have destiny and significance. This is exactly why the church damages its own capacity to function as Jesus intended when we marginalize any member of the body of Christ. When we apply the idea of nested hierarchy to apostolic organization, we need to be attentive to the basic unit of ecclesia as much as we need to attend to the larger issues of movement and multiplication. All aspects movements r us 223 are vital. There are at least four layers of nested hierarchy in the ecclesia: the individual/human, the social/communal, the organizational/system, and the movement/exponential multiplication (Figure 10.2). Apostolic movements will always require varying levels of organization—the individual, community, organization, and movement. But each level requires a different leader’s response, skill set, and focus. What is required at the base level of the individual will not produce movement, but if the base level is not attended to, no movement will be possible. Trying to achieve significant movement without paying attention to each successive layer and what is required there is like pressing harder on the gas pedal while remaining in first gear: RPM will increase, but without shifting gears, it will not accelerate movement. The same is true in an apostolic movement. In order for motion to translate into movement, there need to be strategic shifts along the way that Movement/exponential multiplication Organizational/ system Social/ communal Individual/ human 224 the permanent revolution release different potentials and capacities throughout the organization. Anticipating, and hence preparing for, these consecutive transition points will help prevent a movement from recoiling in on itself. This does not minimize the importance of the individual elements at the base level. In fact, it only highlights their determinative nature. Without a good basis in each preceding level, the ecclesia cannot develop into a fully fledged movement, even though it contains all the potential to do so. In Figure 10.3, you can see some of the essential functions of foundational apostolic ministry: discipling, networking, architecting, and resourcing. These are foundational but are also reflected throughout the whole. As foundations, they form a platform for all subsequent layers in the nested hierarchy. Although they are always present at every level, the focus shifts as the level of organization moves to the next stage. At all stages, leadership should have these four functions in mind, but emphasis will shift as the organization develops toward movement. So while strategic emphasis will shift depending on the level of organization, development at every level should still be attentive to building individual, social, systemic, and exponential capacities. Discipling the individual should begin with the end in mind and end with the beginning in mind. individual social systemic exponential capacities capacities capacities capacities individual social systemic exponential capacities capacities capacities capacities individual social systemic exponential capacities capacities capacities capacities individual social systemic exponential capacities capacities capacities capacities Levels of Organization movements r us 225 Remember, in every believer is the possibility of a movement. As the forest is contained within the potential of a seed, so in every individual Christ follower is the possibility of community, and in a community the real possibility of a translocal, transformative movement. Seeing people in this way (we believe it is the way Jesus sees us) changes the way we perceive and do “church” forever. It is this dynamically apostolic, profoundly movemental quality that the institutional view of ecclesia conceals from our view. An example of this movemental approach can be seen in Trinity Grace Church in New York City, led by movement starter Jon Tyson, from Australia. As an apostolic leader, he is attentive to basic algorithms, reproducibility, discipleship, scalability, and core theology. As a result he has developed a flourishing, fully reproducible movement in the making in one of the hardest contexts for the gospel in the United States. 3DM adopted a similar approach with its lifeshapes model, which embeds key practices at every level of organization. It has eight distinct shapes, each representing a different aspect of discipleship and church life. All members are apprenticed into using the shapes as a way of forming their lives and formatting their ministries.29 In this chapter we have suggested that the archetypal organizational form for apostolic ministry and impact is that of the people movement. No one would doubt that the New Testament church, as well as the subsequent early church, was a formidable, highly transformative people movement. Whenever that movement form was explicitly adopted since then, either because of circumstance (for example, persecution) or because of new apostolic work among new groups, the church has grown exponentially. Whether it was the Celtic church that evangelized Western Europe, the early Methodists who had a profound impact on the world, the Moravians, early Pentecostals, the Chinese underground church, and the others, movements are the forms of the church that change the world. We are now seeing the early adoption (or maybe readoption) of these forms among more established churches. The movement that emerged from St. Thomas Crookes in Sheffield is a good case in point. But churches as diverse as Southside (in British Columbia), the Austin Stone, the Tampa Underground, Granger Community Church, New Thing Network, and Missio, all are heading in this direction. Organization matters. It involves the mobilization of bias in one form or another. If we hope to be a missional movement in our age, we must set about designing and biasing the church to be the high-impact missional agency it was intended to be in the first place. The effectiveness of 226 the permanent revolution the church and the healthy spread of the gospel are inextricably connected with our capacity to organize rightly. The medium must become the message and strive for more consistency with it. We have no doubt that the apostolic movement is the form that gives the church its best opportunity to extend Christianity far into this century. Far from being alien to who we are, movements are our most primal form, and we are at our best behavior and have the greatest impact when we are moving along with the Holy Spirit. Movements R Us! ‌Apostolic Architecture the anatomy of missional organization Much of what we face can’t be deterred, prevented or even predicted. Thus we need to become resilient. There is nothing neutral about the way we organize. The most important ideas of all are meta-ideas, that is, ideas about how to support the production and transmission of other ideas. dee hock, the founder of visa whom we met in chapter ten, was called in by the banking system in the 1960s to find a solution to the increasing complexities presented by the introduction of the credit card system. It was widely agreed that credit cards themselves were a major innovation for the finance and banking sector, but at that point, each bank and corporation had its own credit card. This meant that consumers had to carry up to twenty different credit cards. The bankers knew that this was unsustainable, so they called Hock in to help sort out the crisis. Hock knew that if a solution was left to the bankers, their focus would be on order, which would result in massive bureaucracy—an unproductive no-win situation. He reasoned that if the problem was left to the more creative types, there would likely be a lot of new ideas but a lot of unsustainable chaos, and the credit card would not survive. That is when Hock designed the chaordic system. 228 the permanent revolution How we structure organization has a direct impact on outcomes—for good or for ill—and leadership must be aware of the implications and face the consequences. Church Resource Ministries founder and international director Sam Metcalf maintains that apostolic impact comes about when the apostolic mission is providing the appropriate structures. His basic formula is that apostolic ministry plus apostolic structure equals apostolic effectiveness. We agree. Forms and structures can either inhibit or promote a cause, and they need constant revitalization to ensure that they do not become ends in themselves. Organizations exist to maintain and deliver the function for which they were made. It is no good trying to build a revived apostolic ministry and structure it around forms and organizations that are built to deliver something fundamentally different. The wineskin won’t hold, and the wine will be wasted (Luke 5:37–39). That is why we need to explore new ways of organizing that are more consistent with the function. The forms we suggest here are those consistent with apostolic and missional bias for movement. We have already mentioned that over time and under the influence of an increasingly institutionalized view of the church, the apostolic ministry so evident throughout the biblical and postbiblical period was eventually sidelined and delegitimized. The apostolic imagination was lost and the view of the church and its mission narrowed. Increasingly, the ecclesia of Christ was identified exclusively as the local church, with a nod toward the overarching concept contained in the idea of the church’s catholicity—the belief in the church universal. The more translocal, distinctly movemental understandings of ecclesia were lost. The significantly diminished view of New Testament ecclesiology was disastrous to the mission and effectiveness of the kind of church that Jesus intended. The church came to be viewed as a hospital for ailing souls or a bastion of theological truth, or some combination of both. Gone was the grand vision for a transformed world. The church had given birth to the so-called Christian civilization, only to become its subservient chaplain. The movement originally made up of pioneers and settlers became increasingly dominated by the settlers to the exclusion of the pioneers. It is not our goal here to write extensively about every possible aspect of apostolic organization, but rather to outline ways in which we believe it is likely to take shape. Here we apply apostolic imagination on the way organization ought to be both conceived and designed. Based on what we know from history and from best practices in organizational theory, we advocate some specific characteristics that are more suited to apostolic architecture 229 the missional challenges we face and will foster the much-needed adaptation demanded of Christian organizations now. Leadership is unlikely to achieve X objective when the organization is biased to achieving a Y objective. Apple trees are, to put it metaphorically, unlikely to produce oranges. So too, organizations produce according to their kind. Design matters. We think that the church of Jesus Christ is designed for missional impact, and if it is not achieving that, then something has gone wrong in the design department. Linda Bergquist and Allan Karr’s book, Church Turned Inside Out, takes issues of design seriously: the approach they suggest of design, redesign, and alignment is very useful at this point.1 Organizational imagineer Gareth Morgan rightly maintains that “organizations are rarely established as ends in themselves. They are instruments created to achieve other ends.”2 Organizations are designed with a distinct purpose in mind. This is also true for our understanding of ecclesia, particularly insofar as the distinctly organizational aspects are concerned. The church, in confessing that it is a sign, symbol, and instrument of the kingdom, recognizes that it is a tool, an instrument, in the hands of her Lord. Problems in organizational design arise when the context changes and the organization itself does not, when the organization itself becomes the mission, or when the organization veers from the path of its original designers. If leaders choose to ignore the issue of design (and the question of constant redesign) and how it directly determines outcomes, then they will inadvertently hand the organization over to latent forces that can be directly at odds with the purposes that members want to achieve. The inevitable result is frustration, even lots of it, at every level of the organization. Such situations are natural seedbeds for dissension, dissatisfaction, and even revolution. As Clay Shirky, the author of the best-selling Here Comes Everybody, observes, “The hallmark of revolution is that the goals of the revolutionaries cannot be contained by the institutional structure of the existing society. As a result, either the revolutionaries are put down, or some of those institutions are altered, replaced or destroyed.”3 This again echoes Jesus’s clear warnings about the problem of wineskins (Matthew 9:14–17). Because we are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving, if the church is in decline, then at least in part it reflects the 230 the permanent revolution fact that we are not operating according to its original apostolic design. The church that Jesus intended and designed is made for impact—and massive, highly transformative impact at that. Jesus said, “I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it” (Matthew 16:18). Note here that Jesus says that the gates of hell do not prevail against us. It is we as God’s people who are on the advance here, not the forces of hell. Contrary to many of the images of church as a defensive fortress suffering the relentless onslaughts of the enemy, the movement that Jesus set in motion is designed to be an advancing, untamed, and untamable revolutionary force created to transform the world. And make no mistake: there is in Jesus’s words a sense of inevitability about the eventual triumph of the gospel and the ecclesia, his chief instrument. If we are not somehow part of this grand movement, then we have to question, among other things, if there is something wrong in the prevailing ways we have designed and organized ourselves.4 Four-Self Dynamics Some serious movemental thinking can be observed in the seminal missiology of Henry Venn and others who developed the concept of generating indigenous churches based on what became known as the three-self principle: self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. While recognizing that in fact Jesus is Lord and that the reference to “self” here is not meant to be interpreted in the sense of the autonomous self so prevalent in our Western culture, the principles here are intended to capture the God-given right of all peoples to have their own distinct cultural identity. Following their missionary instincts, along with the methodological clues contained in the scriptures themselves, movement starters must encourage local, indigenous forms of ecclesia and discourage the adoption of foreign cultural forms. Missionaries must actively discourage any childlike dependency by the new churches that would hinder their growth and maturity. This kind of dependency can be observed in many missionary contexts (Africa and Papua New Guinea, for example), where new churches were made dependent on external missionary support and failed not to flourish as a result. They became known as “rice Christians”—people who converted for the benefits such as rice that the foreign missionaries brought. The same principle is true for many denominational church plants in the West. New “parachute” church plants that are fully funded by denominational headquarters and lack a grassroots mission approach to evangelism and mission have less independence and are less likely to flourish. apostolic architecture 231 An ardent disciple of the three-self principles, seminal thinker Roland Allen taught that the church’s missionary activity derives not from organizational control but from “the expression of the spontaneous individual activity of its members; for every member was potentially a missionary.”5 Out of his mission experience around the turn of the nineteenth century in China, he reflected on the factors that encouraged and inhibited the spontaneous expansion of the gospel. These were his conclusions: Factors That Encourage Spontaneous Expansion When people whose lives have been affected profoundly by the gospel tell their story to those who know them. When from the beginning, evangelism is the work of those within the culture. When new Christians are immediately given the opportunity to learn by ministering to non-Christians rather than sitting in a classroom. When the church is self-supporting and provides for its own leaders and facilities. When true doctrine results from the true experience of the power of Christ rather than mere intellectual instruction.6 When new churches are given the freedom to learn by experience.7 Factors That Inhibit Spontaneous Expansion When paid (foreign) professionals are primarily responsible to spread the gospel, which is then perceived as an alien intrusion. When the church becomes dependent on external funds and leadership.8 When spread of the gospel is controlled out of fear, and both error and godly zeal are suppressed. Allen believed the great things of God are beyond our control. He observed that control produces sterility. Thinking of the Western missions he experienced in China, he noted, “Our converts have not gone astray, but neither they have produced anything.”9 When it is believed that the church is to be founded, educated, and equipped, established in the doctrine and ethics and organization first; then it is to expand.10 When emerging leaders are restricted from ministering until they are fully trained. In this way, they learn the lesson of inactivity and dependency.11 232 the permanent revolution When we attempt to convert by clever argument rather than the power of Christ. When a professional class controls the ministry and discourages the spontaneous zeal of those who are not members of their profession.12 There is a lot of apostolic movement power in the principles of spontaneous expansion (and a lot of stopping power in the inhibiting factors). For instance, in 1899, John Livingston Nevius, an apostle to China and a devotee of the three-self principles, trained a groups of missionaries who were going into groups of previously unreached people in Korea in the use of the three-self principles.13 The missionaries sent to establish the Korean church adopted them, and the mission was wildly successful. The historical irony is significant. The ideas themselves were originally formulated in China, prior to the communist revolution, but the Chinese church never took the three-self principles seriously, and therefore the growth in China was painstakingly slow. The mission in Korea adopted them wholeheartedly, and the movement grew exponentially and continues to do so to this day.14 The lessons are stark: the way we organize has a direct impact on the church’s capacity to be the transformative people movement it was originally designed to be. To underscore this point, we need only recognize that the exponentially expanding Chinese underground movement was not born until after the purging of foreign missionaries from China in the early 1950s. In the wake of this and after waves of serious persecution, the church was forced to discover the power of indigenous, organic growth. It seems that God had to remove the professional Christians, along with the institutional forms of church that they maintained, so that the people of God could become the people of God. This perhaps was the real revolution going on in the Chinese Revolution. We suggest that the original three-self principles could be updated and expanded to four: all apostolic movements ought to strive to be selforganizing, self-generating, self-sustaining, and self-reflecting (Figure 11.1).15 Using this framework will undoubtedly steer us away from many problems related to institutionalization, not to mention the avoidance of unhealthy dependencies down the track. Self-Organizing Essentially any organization is an effort to contain, channel, or mobilize resources. The idea of self-organization is no different. All living apostolic architecture 233 Movemental organization Self-reflecting Self-generating Self-organizing Self-sustaining systems have the seemingly natural capacity to organize themselves in order to achieve the desired outcomes. This is perhaps especially true for the ecclesia, which not only has the guiding presence of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16), and a direct relationship with the Lord, but has built-in spiritual intelligence by which it can operate (Ephesians 4:7–16; 1 Corinthians:12–14; Romans 12:1–7). This is entirely consistent with the concept of self-organization in living systems theory, which both recognizes and seeks to enhance the innate potential within groups of people to self-organize through an evolving process that draws on existing resources within and around the group. Thought leaders Margaret Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers rightly note: All living systems have the capacity to self-organize, to sustain themselves and move toward greater complexity and order as needed. They can respond intelligently to the need for change. They organize (and then reorganize) themselves into adaptive patterns and structures without any externally imposed plan or direction In these systems, change is the organizing force, not a problematic intrusion. Structures and solutions are temporary. Resources and people come together to create new initiatives, to respond to new regulations, to shift the organization’s processes. Leaders emerge from the needs of the moment. There are far fewer levels of management. Experimentation is the norm.16 234 the permanent revolution Although they did not use the term itself, self-organizing is exactly what the original apostles sought to develop in the life of the local communities they helped establish.17 Clearly they took people and place, with the associated cultural forms, seriously. For instance, what worked culturally and theologically in Jerusalem would not necessarily work in Corinth, and they did not assume it would. Because their particular sense of calling, together with their desire to faithfully witness (and sometimes their very survival), were
