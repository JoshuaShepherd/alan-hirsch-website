## Introduction

Failure to align with the foundational teachings of Ephesians 4 has seriously undermined our capacity to be the ecclesia. If we regard the New Testament codes as authoritative—analogous to genetic codes in biological systems—we must strive to align ourselves with them. The church's lack of adherence to Ephesians 4 stands as a clear case of altering the genetic code, with predictable negative consequences. It is time to correct this flaw in our ecclesiology. This chapter introduces the foundational dimensions of Ephesians 4 and provides context for understanding the apostolic ministry. Ephesians 4 is the foundation for all subsequent discussion about apostolic ministry in this book.

## Almost a Silver Bullet

In discussing Ephesians 4:1–16, we are tempted to consider it a silver bullet—a guaranteed solution for a difficult problem. While we do not ultimately agree with such simplistic thinking, we have come to see it as almost a silver bullet: a full appreciation and application of Ephesians 4 has the potential to unleash enormous energies and awaken unrealized potential in the church.

All observable, transformative apostolic movements with exponential missional impact have operated with some expression of the fivefold ministry. We are convinced this principle is rooted in explicit Scripture, evidenced in church history, corroborated by contemporary global movements, and supported by social science. The rediscovery and reapplication of this aspect of Pauline ecclesiology carries massive consequences for our time.

## The Devil Made Me Do It

In writing this, we acknowledge the tension with inherited Western ecclesiastical assumptions. Indeed, there are hundreds of millions of believers, thousands of churches, and movements worldwide that embrace Ephesians 4, but from a global perspective, our Western views are the minority. The APEST (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, and Teacher) typology is a significant aspect of Pauline ecclesiology. Despite scattered affirmations, we have found no theologically substantial, published work dedicated solely to this topic.

Many twentieth-century books from Pentecostal and Charismatic perspectives are one-dimensional, fundamentalist, shallow, and often promote domination theology—an overly hierarchical approach our Lord expressly forbids (Matthew 20:25–28). Such books have given critics an easy straw man to dismiss.

Consider how many theological books have existed—tens of millions—yet few if any explore fivefold ministry as vital for the church’s genetic coding. While theological libraries contain thousands of books on obscure topics, almost none offer a focused, open-minded examination of Ephesians 4’s deeply foundational ecclesiology.

This silence is a tragic omission and a direct indictment of our integrity, love of truth, desire for God, and scholarship. The only plausible conclusion is that this is the work of the Devil. If Satan aimed to hobble the church, dividing foundational ministry, delegitimizing and over-legitimizing certain roles, and rendering ministry ineffective would be a prime tactic. Telling the truth about Ephesians 4 positions us to embrace reality.

## "Perfectly Designed"

> "We are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving."

Like a tree bears fruit suited to its species, so do our organizational systems yield results for which they are designed. If the church is in decline, there are usually identifiable—and correctable—causes. Good leadership asks, “What is our core purpose?” and makes the right choices to remain true to it.

Nothing is fatalistic here; right outcomes result from appropriate leadership vision and the will to act. If the church fails in its mission, leaders must direct it to reform. To refuse is to abdicate their calling before God.

Our hope lies in this: the ecclesia is perfectly designed by God to accomplish his intentions. If we believe Jesus and the Scriptures, we already possess everything we need. Impact is built into ecclesia. Apostolic movements often achieve huge results with few resources—the church is designed for transformation.

## A Missional Ministry for a Missional Church

One of the church’s greatest challenges is understanding what it means to be missional. Many conversations, however, falter because people are unwilling to recalibrate ecclesiology. Christendom has typically operated from a shepherd-teacher model, dispensing with the more missionally inclined apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic functions. These inherited forms are ill-equipped for the current context because they refuse to recalibrate along Ephesians 4.

To be genuinely missional, a missional ministry is required—bringing apostle, prophet, and evangelist roles back to the fore. Without this, truly missional church is unattainable.

### Working Definitions of the Five Gifts

- **Apostle**: Provides overall vigor and extends Christianity, chiefly through mission and church planting. The ministry of "sent-ness" is uniquely missional.
- **Prophet**: Maintains faithfulness to God within the community, acting as a guardian of the covenant.
- **Evangelist**: Infectiously recruits and enlists others, transmitting the gospel message.
- **Shepherd (Pastor)**: Nurtures spiritual development, communal health, and loving community.
- **Teacher**: Mediates wisdom and understanding, bringing comprehensive insight to the church's revelation.

All five are necessary for the authentically missional church Jesus intends.

## The Order of Creation and the Order of Redemption

APEST gifts, as Andrew Dowsett observes, are not limited to the "order of redemption" (the church), but are reflected in broader human experience—part of the "order of creation." Jesus liberates people with these giftings (apostolic, prophetic, instructive types) and gives them to the church, realigning and reassigning their significance and function.

- **Apostles**: Pioneers—entrepreneurs, system architects, or movement starters, Christian or not.
- **Prophets**: Visionaries—those passionate about justice, the arts, or environmental concerns.
- **Evangelists**: Promoters—able to rally enthusiasm and transmit core messages.
- **Pastors**: Community builders—nurturers and healers, even outside the church.
- **Teachers**: Philosophers, trainers, thought leaders.

Healthy leadership in any organization requires a similar mix; dysfunction arises when only two types are present. Full redemption channels and focuses these types into the church as Christ’s gifts (Eph. 4:8–10).

## A Letter for Everyone

Ephesians is addressed not to theologians or leaders, but to the ordinary people—women, men, slaves, people of varied races, classes, and statuses—making up the house churches. It is a letter for the church about the church, universal in scope and application. Unlike highly contextual letters (Galatians, 2 Corinthians), Ephesians offers foundational, constitutional directives for the church everywhere.

---

## The Constitution of the Church (With No Amendments Allowed)

Markus Barth calls this section "The Constitution of the Church," with verses 11 and 12 providing the operational framework. Ephesians is Paul’s most direct, authoritative word on ecclesia; it sets the framework and criteria by which the church must operate. The APEST configuration is the interpretative center for ministry; annulling even part of it is like running government without executive powers.

### The "Vocabulary of Organizing"

William Ocasio, in his analysis of the Columbia shuttle disaster, observes that organizational language determines what gets noticed or ignored. "The vocabulary of organizing serves to provide the organizational categories which designate what constitutes a problem or issue to be attended to as well as what type of solutions and initiatives are to be considered." This is true of the church: omitting apostle, prophet, and evangelist from our vocabulary renders their concerns invisible and leaves the church perfectly designed for its current (often limited) outcomes.

Adopting a full APEST vocabulary revolutionizes the conception and practice of church, enabling new possibilities and multidimensional engagement.

## Getting Into the Text (or, Allowing It to Get Into Us)

Ephesians 4:1–16 unfolds across three movements:

1. **Unity** (vv. 1–6): Oneness in God, faith, and church.
2. **Diversity/APEST** (vv. 7–11): The Christ-apportioned gifts.
3. **Maturity** (vv. 12–16): The result—building up, unity, and the fullness of Christ.

### 1. Unity in the One God (vv. 1–6)

Paul opens with a call to live worthy of the calling, emphasizing humility, patience, unity, and peace. He introduces seven "ones"—one body, Spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism, and God—establishing the universal theological coordinates for unity.

### 2. Diversity in APEST (vv. 7–11)

Paul affirms that Christ has given grace and gifts to each as he wills. The fivefold ministries (apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, teacher) are Christological in source and form the constitutional ministry of the church.

### 3. Growing Up into Christ (vv. 12–16)

APEST is given to prepare God’s people for service, to build up the body, attain unity and maturity, and reach the fullness of Christ. This protects against theological drift and ensures the church’s organic wholeness.

## Can We Mature with a Twofold Ministry?

The plain teaching and logic of Ephesians 4:1–16 indicate that exclusive reliance on shepherd-teacher ministry cannot produce a fully mature church. Removing three of the five constitutional ministries (apostle, prophet, evangelist) is contrary to the text’s intention and has repeatedly led to the church’s frustration and ineffectiveness.

*Example: The Greek word _katartismos_ (equip), used here, includes the meaning of setting a broken bone—restoring function. APEST is necessary for the church to "walk" and "stand" against the principalities and powers (Eph. 6:10–16).*

## The Exiling of the APEs

This book explores in depth why apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic ministries have been exiled and the disastrous consequences. Ministry has been forced into the narrow categories of shepherd and teacher, denying legitimacy to other forms. If we ignore the APEST formula, we will not realize the outcomes Scripture promises.

---

## The Bed of Procrustes

The "procrustean bed" is a cautionary allegory: setting an arbitrary standard and forcing all else to conform. Our tradition has wedged ministry into shepherd-teacher forms, forcing the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic into roles they don’t fit.

Notably, the word for shepherd/pastor (_poimen_) is used only once for ministry in the New Testament (Ephesians 4:7); yet "pastor" has become the catchall title. In contrast, the teacher role, though used more often, comes with the warning that few should pursue it (James 3:1).

---

## One Aorist Rules Them All

The verbs for "given" (edothe) in verses 7 and 11 are aorist indicatives—adamant and without ambiguity. All five ministries are given, once and for all, as a complete, constitutional unit. You cannot remove or diminish one without undermining the whole.

---

## To Each One of Us

APEST is frequently misread as pertaining only to leadership, equipping some to equip others. But in verse 7, Paul says "to each one of us" (Greek: hekasto)—literally, "to each and every person." All believers, across gender, race, and status, fit somewhere within APEST.

This is not primarily a leadership text, but a ministry text. Every believer is endowed with a gifting, and ministry is a calling distinct from leadership. Leadership is a calling within a calling—some are gifted as prophets, for example, but not all are to lead.

---

## The Ministry of Christ in and Through the Body

APEST is part of the DNA of the church because it reflects the multifaceted ministry of Jesus:

- **Apostle**: The archetype of sent-ness
- **Prophet**: The model of divine speech and vision
- **Evangelist**: The bringer of good news
- **Shepherd**: The nurturing caretaker
- **Teacher**: The master of wisdom

If we are the body of Christ, we should reflect these dimensions. Anything less than a fivefold ministry misrepresents Christ.

Max Weber’s "routinization of charisma" helps illustrate this: after a charismatic leader departs, the original roles are distributed among followers. In the church, Jesus has distributed his fivefold ministry roles within the body to perpetuate his movement.

---

## Why This List Alone?

Why privilege the Ephesians 4 list over those in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12? Paul introduces APEST in Ephesians as vocations—integrating identity and calling, rather than listing activities or tools. Gifts from Romans and Corinthians are like a tool belt, resources to fulfill the vocation corresponding to one’s APEST identity.

Example: A prophet may practice prayer, dreams, or insight as tools, but his/her vocation is to be a prophet.

Ephesians 4:11 is the organizing principle for other giftings, rooting each individual’s ministry in vocational identity.

## Call to Action

Henri Matisse said, "To look at something as though we had never seen it before requires great courage. To look at something and recognize its truth and not be willing to change is cowardice." For church leaders, refusing repentance on this point amounts to defiance. The time for recalibrating our ministry DNA is now, so the church can once again access the full spectrum of Christ’s collective intelligence.

# An Elegant Solution: Distributed Intelligence in the Body of Christ

> "There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle."
>
> "When a paradigm shifts, everyone goes back to zero. Learning to observe the whole system is difficult. Our traditional analytic skills can’t help us."
>
> —Margaret J. Wheatley

Einstein remarked that "when the solution is simple, God is speaking." E = MC² is such an elegant solution—maximum effect, minimum means. Ephesians 4 offers an elegant, symmetrical solution to the complexity of church ministry, far superior to the inadequate twofold shepherd-teacher model.

The following sections and subsequent chapters will more deeply define these ministries, especially the prophetic and evangelistic. Each carries a distinct "intelligence"—not merely IQ, but emotional intelligence and vocational aptitude.

### The Five APEST Intelligences

- **Apostolic Intelligence (AQ)**: Custodian of the DNA; extends Christianity into new ground, sustains systemic health, mobilizes for movement, and maintains local and global networks.
- **Prophetic Intelligence (PQ)**: Guardian of faithfulness; deeply connected with God, calling people to covenant fidelity, sensing and naming toxic or unjust environments; passionate, spiritual, and driven by divine pathos.
- **Evangelistic Intelligence (EQ)**: (To be defined further in following chapters.)
- **Shepherd Intelligence (SQ)**: (To be defined further in following chapters.)
- **Teaching Intelligence (TQ)**: (To be defined further in following chapters.)

Collectively, these intelligences synergistically heighten the church’s adaptability, creativity, and effectiveness. Each brings a unique vocational "bias," and together, they comprise the multidimensional task force of the church.

## Conclusion

Once the rightful place of APEST is recognized, the church is seen anew: full of potential, possibility, and designed for transformation. Embracing the fivefold paradigm is akin to releasing nuclear fission—unlocking latent power for world-changing impact.

Let us be courageous enough to change, and faithful enough to build according to Christ’s design.
