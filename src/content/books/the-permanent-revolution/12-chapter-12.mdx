---Alive Within the Corporation (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006). Perhaps the best way to describe what we are attempting to do here is captured by Max Weber’s concept of the ideal type. As articulated by Joseph Blenkinsopp, Weber’s ideal type is “a construction based on abstraction and 288 notes conceptualization that has the purpose of guiding inquiry back into the mass of available data. They are a means of provisional classification, allowing for some preliminary understanding of the phenomenon, creating and testing hypotheses, distinguishing between constants and variables, and identifying deviations.” J. Blenkinsopp, Sage, Priest, Prophet: Religious and Intellectual Leadership in Ancient Israel (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox Press, 1995), p. 116. Our effort to classify apostolic people and their ministries should be seen as an attempt to construct an ideal type; as in Weber’s understanding, we are not trying to create water-tight compartments with hardand-fast definitions. The term deep structure was first used in R. Drazin and L. E. Sandelands, “Autogenesis: A Perspective on the Process of Organizing,” Organization Science, 1992, 3, 230–249. It should be abundantly clear by now that we do not believe in apostolic succession as it is formulated by Rome and affirmed to a lesser degree by other variations of sacramental, high church ecclesiology. We see that this was part of the later reappropriation of apostolic authority used to bolster the institution of the church. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Jesus, the archetypal prophet, who reserves his harshest words for religious professionals and religious institutions, would authorize any institution in this way, thereby substituting one for another. Rather, we should read this for what it is: a commissioning of an apostle—in this case, the one who was to lead the others. See the Appendix. For instance, forgiveness of sins is in the gospel itself. It is contrary to the New Testament, and to Protestant, teaching to say that only Peter could forgive sins by binding and loosing. A. Hirsch and D. Ferguson, On the Verge: A Journey into the Apostolic Future of the Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 2011). E. Schein, Organizational Culture and Leadership (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2010). Schein’s book is an excellent source for Petrine apostles who want to sharpen their understanding of cultural dynamics within organizations. Ibid., chap. 2. For thorough expositions of this idea, see A. Hirsch, The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos, 2007); A. Hirsch and D. Altclass, The Forgotten Ways Handbook (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos, 2009); and especially Hirsch and Ferguson, On the Verge. There is no evidence, outside of Acts 2 and 10, that Peter founded any churches at all in the Pauline sense. This could be why 1 Peter is addressed to churches in the Asia Minor Province, an area where Paul had developed a church planting movement. Peter seems to be operating in his apostolic vocation by addressing the already existing people of God through these letters. See for instance A.-L. Barabasi, Linked: The New Science of Networks (Cambridge, Mass.: Perseus, 2002), and R. Ogle, Smart World: Breakthrough notes 289 Creativity and the New Science of Ideas (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2007). M. Gladwell, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (New York: Back Bay Books, 2002). See Ogle, Smart World, for an exploration of network theory and innovation. D.

Kotter, A Sense of Urgency (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Business School Press, 2008), and Leading Change (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Business School Press, 1996). Whatever has been initiated in the missio Dei, the Incarnation, and the Cross is not yet complete until Jesus returns, with all that this means for the world and the church. There is also a well-noted relationship between suffering and sanctification in Peter’s writings, a suffering that arises from the tension felt between the times. These are distinctly eschatological themes. While Paul is in Jerusalem, he is always stirring up trouble and stepping on toes. He may find himself in politically charged environments, but he does not navigate them well. One has to wonder why he stirs up all kinds of trouble while the other apostles, still ministering in word and in prayer in the Jerusalem church, seem to be getting along fairly well with others in the city. Paul is culturally savvy, but he is not necessarily politically savvy. Peter, in contrast, is quick to accommodate the popular census, evidenced by his actions in Antioch. See Galatians 2.

Hostie, The Life and Death of Religious Orders (Washington, D.C.: Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, 1983), p. 277. From a conversation with Dallas Willard in March 2010. All this squares well with the formative thinking of the sociologist Max Weber. Weber maintained that the process of institutionalization and renewal involved a constant return to the charismatic center in order to relegitimize or, in our language, refound the subsequent movement. To remain true, all religious organizations require a form of renewal that encompasses a return to the original ethos and the power of the founder. And whether one applies this to a denomination or to Christianity as a whole, one can refer to this rediscovery of one’s original message as radical traditionalism because it goes back to the organization’s deepest tradition and reinterpret it for a new context. Quoted in Hirsch and Frost, ReJesus, p. 77. Although many people use the term radical to mean a departure from the traditional, it in fact refers to a return to the root cause of a thing. Thinkexist .com defines radical as “of or pertaining to the root or origin; reaching to the center, to the foundation, to the ultimate sources, to the principles, or the like; original; fundamental; thorough-going; unsparing; extreme; as in radical evils; radical reform; a radical party” (http://thinkexist.com/dictionary/ meaning/radical/).

See also Allen’s Missionary Methods: St. Paul’s and Ours (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1962). It is also important to note that Chinese nationals like Watchman Nee, the notes 291 theologian and writer, also helped develop a church structure that allowed the church in China to go underground.

Morris, Entrepreneurial Intensity: Sustainable Advantages for Individuals, Organizations, and Societies (Westport, Conn.: Quorum Books, 1998), p. 44. The designation skunk works is widely used in business, engineering, and technical fields to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy, tasked with working on advanced or secret projects. Although we think the idea is good, what we have in mind is something that is more a part of the actual organization itself rather than being an isolated unit with little or no legitimacy. Morris, Entrepreneurial Intensity, p. 19. We are indebted to Morris for the insights set out in this section. An example of this is what is happening to the publishing world today. Digital media are game changers. This has been accelerated by the introduction of the electronic readers and, even more so, Apple’s iPad. Also, what is less known about the acute forms of entrepreneurial intensity perhaps is that many of these never make it to the light of day. The problem is that such innovation is so far ahead of the game as not to be able to change it. Such organizations and individuals can find themselves stranded. An example is Macintosh’s Newton, its early tablet computer that was way ahead of its time. For more about Fresh Expressions, see http://www.freshexpressions.org.uk/. ”The group’s purpose is to develop something quickly with minimal management constraints. Skunk works are often used to initially roll out a product or service that thereafter will be developed according to usual business processes.” http://bit.ly/dS4Piu. The approach is different from having an inhouse research and development function in that it is usually located far from the center of the organization and is somewhat secretive so that it can operate without the normal constraints of the organization. However, because it is thus marginalized from the center, it seldom has an impact on the culture of an organization in a systemic and meaningful way. See Hirsch and Ferguson, On the Verge, for the idea of 40:60 appeal. Proven models, or algorithms, can play a significant role in the viability of any enterprise, but that role is inherently limited when we take in the scope of the missional mandate to seed the gospel among every group of people. The entrepreneurial force driving a franchising type of church planting movement will propel it across geographical boundaries, but it will struggle in crossing cultural boundaries. Mass-producing the prevailing models of church may prove to be efficient in the short run, but in the long run, if the nature and scope of apostolic ministry do not begin to expand to include cross-cultural, and therefore incarnational, approaches, then despite our notes 293 apparent progress in geographical expansion, we will still be ignoring the more complex dimensions of the adaptive challenge. The nature and scope of apostolic ministry need to experience a sort of disenfranchising in order to reach its full capacity for missional impact. See Hirsch and Ferguson, On the Verge, for an exploration of both-and approaches to developing apostolic movements. The main churches involved are part of the Future Travelers group.

I tell a bit of this story in chap. 1 of The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos, 2007). In light of this, we suggest that the more standard, and we would suggest secular, approach is to have a board of chickens rule and direct the pigs. This might be fine in big corporations, but in start-ups or, in our case, missional projects, this is not good practice. It is hard to see Paul outsourcing direction and policy to a board. J.

R. Martin, The Design of Business: Why Design Thinking Is the Next Competitive Advantage (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2009). Because they have produced a measure of evangelistic success, the purely attractional, seeker-sensitive, church growth models have, until recently, served as our reliable algorithm when it comes to charting our path into the future. Yet these models participate in the same limitations as every other algorithm: although they may have experienced a certain evangelistic success within particular cultural environments, the immensity of the current challenge now requires a different algorithm.

Ogle, Smart World: Breakthrough Creativity and the New Science of Ideas (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2007), for a thorough exploration of the inner dynamics of innovation. F.

One of the main theses of Hirsch and Frost, The Faith of Leap, is that adventure and risk fundamentally change the way we think and act. By choosing to put ourselves in the risky business of mission, we are more likely to learn new things about God, faith, discipleship, leadership, and church.

This means [re]coding the organization around a serious engagement with the Kingdom of God manifested in and through Jesus, the idea of discipleship and the process of disciple making, how and why to engage in incarnational forms of mission, activating a fully fledged APEST form of ministry and leadership, creating organic systems in relation to organization and structure, and engendering a lively sense of dare and the ability to engage and thrive in risky situations (communitas).

To leave newly born churches to learn by experience is apostolic; to abandon them is not apostolic. To watch over them is apostolic; to be always nursing 298 notes them is not apostolic. To guide their education is apostolic; to provide it for them is not apostolic. Ibid. “Nothing is so weakening as the habit of depending upon others for those things which we ought to supply for ourselves. How can a man propagate a religion which he cannot support and which he cannot expect those whom he addresses to be able to support?” Ibid., p. 46. Ibid., p. 60. The great things of God are beyond our control. By inserting this term between the first conversions and their coming into ministry, we teach them to focus on their own progress rather than on outreach. They lose their zeal for the conversion of others. Ibid., pp. 27–28. Heresies are produced not by ignorance but by the speculations of learned men. Allen, The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church, p. 62. “Spontaneous zeal is alarming to them. When the faith is spread spontaneously, both the charlatan and the saint find an opportunity for acquiring influence over others. Side by side with Peter is Simon Magus. In the working of an organization, the man who is welcome and at home is the plain, mechanical, orderly man who will keep within the bounds. Not only the swindler but the inspired saint is a difficulty. He appears self-willed, extravagant, eccentric. He is independent and is always on the verge of breaking the orderly methods of the organization.” Ibid., p. 148. Nevius wrote his ideas in 1899 in The Planting and Development of Missionary Churches: His Basic Principles, where he suggested the following strategic guides to missions. Christians should continue to live in their neighborhoods and pursue their occupations, being self-supporting and witnessing to their coworkers and neighbors. Missions should develop only programs and institutions that the national church desires and supports. The national churches should call out and support their own pastors. Churches should be built in the native style with money and materials given by the church members. Intensive biblical and doctrinal instruction should be provided for church leaders every year. It is amazing that we are still trying to get missionaries to adopt these principles over 110 years later. The “three-self” church strategy states that a church should be selfgoverning, self-supporting, and self-replicating. These ideas infused Nevius’s thinking (they originally were called the Venn-Anderson principles). See the thoughts of missiologist Ted Esler at http://www.esler.org/2010/03/14/ whatsnew/. For Nevius, see “John Livingstone Nevius,” http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/John_Livingstone_Nevius. The further irony is that the state-sponsored church of China today is formally called the “Three Self Church,” and although it is growing, it is being seriously outpaced by the underground house church movement, which now intentionally practices the three-self principles. We acknowledge that David Bosch added to the three-self principles the additional concept of self-theologizing. This is a significant addition, but we opt to reformulate these principles for the Western context. D. J. Bosch, notes 299 Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1997), pp. 450–457. M. J. Wheatley and M. Kellner-Rogers, “The Irresistible Future of Organizing,” July–Aug. 1996, http://www.margaretwheatley.com/articles/ irresistiblefuture.html. Living systems theory, which builds on and develops the idea of selforganization in human organization, is much closer to New Testament ecclesiology than the predominantly mechanistic approach we have relied on for centuries.

The authors compare this to the Baptist growth over the same period and noted that the Baptists insisted on similar educational qualifications only later in the twentieth century, which also initiated the decline of the Southern Baptists at that point. The collegiate university was originally modeled after the inclusion of all the elements of the “universe.” As such, it sought to include as part of its repertoire of training and education a sampling of the basic fields and practices found in society. If we reapply this rationale to seminaries and theological universities, it seems logical to include and organize the university around 300 notes the universal categories of ministry in Ephesians 4 that no less constitute the very church that those seminaries seek to serve and empower. This is a far cry from the discipleship-based action learning system that the Bible itself maintains is necessary for theological integrity and to transfer faith meaningfully. We typically quote Jesus as saying, “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32), but we fail to put this in its immediate context, which changes the equation entirely. To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples” (John 8:31). Understanding of truth, and experiencing the freedom found in it, is predicated on first being a disciple. One cannot know truth divorced from the context of discipleship. This insight is gleaned from friend and colleague Caesar Kalinowski. Allen, The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church, p. x. Addison, Movement Dynamics, p. 73. R.

Paul’s network of associates shared one fundamental characteristic inherent to the designation of coworker: their assistance to the apostle during one or more phases of his ministry. Whether the coworkers labored independently on Paul’s behalf or served directly at his side, each of them helped him establish and maintain the work of the gospel. This assistance grew out of the special relationships Paul developed with his coworkers. Some of these relationships spanned many years, numerous missions, and various situations. In others, association with Paul was more occasional in nature. For further reflections on this topic, see S. Maness, “Paul and His Fellow-Workers: Determinate Trajectories for the Ministries of Paul’s Partners in the Gospel” (unpublished doctoral dissertation, Dallas Theological Seminary, 1992). Taken from the lecture notes of Sam Metcalf and used with permission. The book of Acts provides further insight into the activities of these apostolic bands. In a given city, they preached the gospel and made disciples who were formed into a fellowship of believers. The band then traveled to other centers to strengthen newly formed churches and returned to home base to report on the success of the mission and prepare for the next (for instance, Acts 14:21–28). Winter, Perspectives on the World Christian Movement, points to the effectiveness of the monastic orders in the spread of the Christian faith during the postapostolic and medieval eras. He attributes the Reformation’s initial missionary impotency to the reformers’ suspicion of the Catholic orders. It was not until a later era and the emergence of Protestant missionary societies that Protestants became involved in world missions. S. Metcalf, “Characteristics of Apostolic Structures,” Under the Iceberg, http://bit.ly/hP0e6Zm. notes 301 H. Halter and M. Smay, And: The Gathered and Scattered Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 2010). Paul explicitly talks about the apostolic ministry (in this case, along with the prophetic ministry) as being foundational to the whole ecclesial project (Ephesians 2:20). He also says that he sees it as his work to lay foundations (1 Corinthians 3:10–12). Probably reflecting these, elsewhere he says that in relation to the other giftings, God has placed apostles first (protos) in the church (1 Corinthians 12:28). However we might envisage this, it must mean that the apostolic has some kind of priority and prominence in the ministry mix. Following the explicit commands and example of Christ in power relations, disciples are not allowed to conceive of their influence in a hierarchical manner (Luke 22:25–27; Philemon 2:1–11), and so when he says “first” in these places, it must mean something more akin to his use of themelios in Ephesians 2:20. And so we believe that the apostolic ministry is in fact the grounding, orienting, or simply catalyst, one in relation to the other ministries and has a very important and ongoing place in the church. In fact, Alan has argued that it is precisely this slippage of our moorings from our Founder that lies at the heart of all toxic expressions of Christian religion. See A. Hirsch and M. Frost, ReJesus: A Wild Messiah for a Missional Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 2009). Without any consideration for any alternative position, the inherited teachings in this regard have effectively have become the theological justifications of the forces favoring equilibrium, for the spiritual coup d’état, and it has been effectively played out over the centuries. U. Sinclair, I, Candidate for Governor: And How I Got Licked (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1935, repr. 1994), p. 109. Prophets also had itinerant ministries, as evidenced in the Didache, a Christian document composed in the later part of the first century of the church, but their ministry was focused on the people of God, not extending the gospel into new territories. Most itinerant prophets ended up settling into a local community. In fact, much of the Cessationist readings of the twentieth century have been shown to be precisely this type of tendentious exegesis—in this case, their personal and preferential distaste for all things charismatic. Any attempt to undermine the fundamentally multidimensional ministry structure of the New Testament church turns out to be a selective, nuanced, and anachronistic reading. Taken at face value and on its own terms, the New Testament itself makes no suggestions of the rescinding of the church’s ministry. Quite frankly, any attempt to make it say something else is manipulative and dishonest. See, for instance, L. D. Edles and S. Appelrouth, Sociological Theory in the Classical Era: Text and Readings (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Pine Forge Press, 302 notes 2010). Every movement goes through phases of evolution and development, and the Jesus movement was no exception. Jesus founds the movement, radically changes and empowers the apostles, and commissions them to disciple the nations (Matthew 28:18–20). The apostles, though not alone in the ministry of Christ to the world, were the effective driving force in the expansion of the church. Their translocal, boundary-crossing, somewhat entrepreneurial form of leadership kept the church on the missional trajectory Jesus envisioned. Their distinctly missional form of leadership was an integral part of the church’s life and consciousness and enjoyed a definitive place in the intellectual real estate of the church. It is logical that later generations would seek to try to encode and routinize their dynamic ministry. For instance, this happens in the New Testament itself. Describing the later Pauline communities, historian Harry Maier notes, “The evidence generally suggests that while Paul was still alive the process of institutionalization was in its early stages. The passage of time, the growth of the group, the physical absence of the apostle, the repeated action of certain members—all these factors encouraged the development of organizational patterns, however informal.” H. O. Maier, The Social Setting of the Ministry as Reflected in the Writings of Hermas, Clement and Ignatius (Canada: Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion, 1991), p. 39. J.D.G. Dunn, Unity and Diversity in the New Testament (Harrisburg, Pa.: Trinity Press, 1977), p. 351. T. F. O’Dea, “Five Dilemmas of the Institutionalization of Religion,” Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1961, 1, quoted in Frost and Hirsch, ReJesus, p. 77. Chapter Three is in many ways an extensive elaboration of this in relation to the role of the Founder of Christianity in the ongoing movement that claims his name. “Herein lies an irresolvable dilemma for religious organizations: although religious movements are born out of firsthand religious experiences, they cannot survive and prosper without some form of stability and order. The charism (the originating grace or gift) has to be diffused, ritualized, and mediated by the organization so that the initial gift of the founder can be made accessible through the organization itself. While O’Dea saw this process of institutionalization as inevitable and even necessary, he also saw that it was paradoxically the process that would dilute or possibly even obliterate the initial message and ethos of the founder. Yet this routinization of charisma has a tendency to snuff out the life it was meant to protect and enhance. The crisis inevitably dawns when the outward forms of worship no longer match the inward experience and spiritual condition of the participants. Decline becomes inevitable. Authentic Christianity is subverted and constant renewals become necessary ... hence the need to re-Jesus the movement.” Frost and Hirsch, ReJesus, p. 77. While institutionalization as structuring the common life is a normal process, institutionalism is another matter entirely. When the institution takes on the notes 303 status of an –ism, a belief system, then it invariably begins to lay claims to authority and ultimately becomes idolatrous. Because of this, we think it best to call the level of institutionalizing in the New Testament as “structuring” the organization or “rhythming” the life of the community because it has not yet hardened into the much more rigid institutionalism that would come with the legalization of Christianity with Constantine. In other words, the persecuted underground church of the first few centuries was preinstitutional or simply structural rather than fully institutionalized. The Church in Catholic theology is seen to be the mystical body of Christ, and the priestly system replaces the mediating work of Jesus. The pope becomes the sole representative of Jesus on earth. All this is the result of the transfer of the initial grace/charism of the movement into the institution. The institution is then totemized; it becomes divine in itself. For the tragic struggle between form and function in religious movements, see O’Dea, “Five Dilemmas of the Institutionalization of Religion.” Interestingly O’Dea is a Catholic theologian and priest. See J. S. Brown and P. Duguid, The Social Life of Information (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2000), for a discussion of how social context is important to the development and interpretation of information and ideas. This accounts for one of the reasons that we always have to be deliberate and return continuously to the Founder of the Christian movement in an ongoing loop of renewal and relegitimization. Again this is the core topic of Frost and Hirsch, ReJesus. Another aspect worth noting here is that the biblical worldview itself is against such depersonalization of ideas. Theological ideas should always guide and inform the relationship between God and his people. In Hebraic perspective, ideas are never important in and of themselves. They serve a greater reality. This is not to say that we do not believe ideas are not important. We have already asserted that they are. But they must never be depersonalized and abstracted from that which they point to and from where they came from. We are not suggesting that there is not a canon of ideas (rightly contained in scripture) that serves as a authority and standard for the church’s thinking and behavior. We are very orthodox (and conservative) in our view of scripture as authoritative for all matters of life and faith. We are simply referring to the distinct idea that infers that we have effectively extracted (and replaced) the essence of apostolic ministry by encoding the doctrine that they taught. This particular doctrine, and it is that, was used as a reason to reject the actual ministry. For an interesting look into the book of Acts from this angle, see M. Sleeman, Geography and the Ascension Narrative in Acts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), and F. S. Spencer, Journeying Through Acts: A Literary-Cultural Reading (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 2004). He goes on to note that “the requirements of bureaucracy override such traditional differentiations of religious leadership as ‘prophet’ versus 304 notes ‘priest,’ ‘scholar versus saint,’ and so forth. Thus it does not matter very much whether a certain bureaucratic functionary comes out of a protestant tradition of ‘prophetic’ ministry or a Catholic tradition of a ‘priestly’ one—in either case, he must above all adapt himself to the requirements of his bureaucratic role.” P. L. Berger, The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion (New York: Anchor Books, 1967), pp. 139–140. L. M. Miller, From Barbarians to Bureaucrats (New York: Fawcett Columbine, 1989). It seems that certain styles of leadership change as an organization moves through its life cycle. To start something from scratch requires something of the entrepreneurial risk-taking type of leader, something of a visionary (to use Miller’s term, the prophet-barbarian). To structure for growth requires a different type of leadership again, one better able to manage the affairs of a growing concern. In fact, when that is necessary, the initiating leader might actually become a hindrance to the organization’s health. At the end of the life cycle are people who at best are maintainers of the system and at worst hinder its possible revitalization. See also I. Adizes, Corporate Lifecycles: How and Why Corporations Grow and Die and What to Do About It, 4th ed. (Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1998), or I. Adizes, Managing Corporate Lifecycles (Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1999). L. Miller, Barbarians to Bureaucrats: Corporate Life Cycle Strategies (New York: Crown, 1989). E. Stetzer, Planting Missional Churches (Nashville, Tenn.: Broadman & Holman, 2006), p. 29. Applying this to the trajectory of early Christianity, the early experience of ecclesia was drawn from the Greco-Roman household (oikos) structure, which naturally supplied the initial organizational template for the church in the beginning. The leadership roles emerged organically, from below, and were a natural development considering the connection the early church had with the household, its primary meeting place. Over time, these roles became formalized and gave birth to models of leadership like those we see in Rome in the writings of Clement with his promotion of the elder-deacon model, or in the writings of Ignatius promoting the threefold bishop-elder-deacon model of leadership. Because these roles ensured the smooth operation of the community along with a higher degree of stability, they formed the templated pattern of organization that later became a formalized, rigid hierarchy consisting of a single bishop ruling over a collection of house churches with a council of elders and administrative deacons. Over time, the clearly biblical roles and functions of apostle (and prophet and evangelist for that matter) are referred to less and less as the more operative, somewhat more bureaucratic approaches to leadership replace them. Here are the roots of the shepherd-teacher hegemony. See Maier, The Social Setting of the Ministry, p. 108. See also R. A. Campbell, The Elders: Seniority Within Earliest Christianity (London: T&T Clark, 1994). notes 305 We see a hint of the beginnings of conflict in Acts 8 when Peter and John make a special trip to Samaria to lay hands on the Samarians to receive the Holy Spirit. Mush discussion swirls around this event and why the Holy Spirit was given to them in this way. A plausible explanation was that the gospel was beginning to stretch beyond the ethnic boundaries of Judaism, which would raise questions about the legitimacy of non-Jewish converts. Peter and John go down to Samaria and lay hands on them to legitimize their conversion, communicating the authenticity and acceptance of the Samaritans into the Jesus movement. However, the conversion of Cornelius would stretch their views of who was allowed to enter the kingdom. Instead of the apostles playing a significant role in the legitimization of the conversion of a new people group through the laying on of hands, the Holy Spirit moved separate and apart from them and legitimized the Gentiles’ status as having equal rights to enter the kingdom of God. We are deeply indebted to Martin Robinson, the key British missiologist, for many suggestions for this list. The issue of apostolic women is complex because they tend to be more hidden and require more research to uncover. In addition, the limitations placed on women by the wider society means that it is harder to point to them as founding movements and easier to see their moral and practical influence. Nevertheless, some female movement leaders are in this list. K.J.A. Small, “Missional Ordered Ministry in the Evangelical Covenant Church,” in C.
