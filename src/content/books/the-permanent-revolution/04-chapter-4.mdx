---# The Unique Role of Apostles and Prophets

> "They serve to call apostolic entrepreneurialism away from pragmatism toward true faithfulness."

This partnership is clearly evident in the New Testament, as well as in both historical and contemporary movements.¹ New Covenant Ministries International, for example, places the apostle-prophet relationship at the heart of its approach to mission.² It requires that all new church planting projects be initiated by a team of apostles and prophets. Similarly, this dynamic serves as a methodological cornerstone for members of the Order of Mission, an international missional network led by Mike Breen. By incorporating APEST (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) into its Lifeshapes system—a foundation for the organization’s approach—these relationships are intentionally structured and honored.³

## Going Out, Going Deep: The Foundational Partnership

There is another perspective on the foundational, inextricable partnership between apostles and prophets. As we have observed, prophets reproach all forms of superficiality, especially regarding God and His concerns. A major characteristic of prophetic ministry, therefore, is a call to depth—the need to identify with culture and place through local participation.

This aligns prophetic ministry with the incarnational aspects of mission:

- Going deep
- Taking culture seriously
- Addressing the heart of the matter
- Exercising patience and attentiveness to what God is already doing
- Honoring justice and shalom

Incarnational ministry requires prophetic patience and discernment, honoring what God is already accomplishing within neighborhoods and individuals.

Meanwhile, the apostolic vocation is to maintain the church's outgoing impulses—the missional “going out.” These dual emphases call the church to both breadth (extension) and depth (rootedness), forming the essential foundation of ecclesia (see Figure 3.2).

- **Missional Impulse: Going Out (Apostolic Driver)**
- **Incarnational Impulse: Going Deep (Prophetic Driver)**

Together, they create the foundation upon which gospel movements are built.

## The Ongoing Dance: Apostolic and Prophetic Partnership

The connection between apostles and prophets extends beyond shared “outlier” vocations; together, they provide the movement’s essential support structure:

- The apostle presses forward, while the prophet keeps the apostle grounded and offers critical feedback.
- As the prophet goes deep, the apostle reminds the prophet of the grander missional objectives of extension and multiplication.

Without apostles, there would be no forward movement; without prophets, movements become shallow, lacking spiritual vitality and transformative power. Health and sustainability for the church as a movement depends on the dynamic dialectic between these two ministries.

Examples:
- **Prophetic-Incarnational**: New monastic movement of Shane Claiborne, Jonathan Wilson Hartgrove, Scott Bessenecker
- **Apostolic-Missional**: Church planting movements associated with Mike Breen (3DM), Neil Cole (Church Multiplication Associates), Jeff Vanderstelt (Soma Communities)

Missional-incarnational movements seek to integrate these approaches, understanding their fundamental interdependence.

# Ensuring Growth: Avoiding the "Iron Law of Involution"

In exploring the special relationship of apostolic and prophetic ministries, we also encounter the apostolic and evangelistic partnership, which is critical for church growth and movement extension.

## The "Iron Law of Involution"

Social movement theory describes the **iron law of involution:** social movements, if they do not achieve tangible outcomes aligned with their mission, inevitably disintegrate into sects and splinter groups.⁴ Involution occurs when revolution loses its forward impact and recoils upon itself.

The apostolic and evangelistic ministries, by fostering growth and producing outcomes, serve as antidotes to involution. Systems dominated solely by shepherds and teachers may stagnate, but apostolic and evangelistic ministries maintain the necessary momentum for lasting revolution.⁵

---

## The Vital Link: Apostles and Evangelists

The church growth movement, led by figures such as Donald McGavran, re-centered evangelism within the church—resulting in tens of millions being evangelized through efforts like the seeker-sensitive movements of the 1980s and 1990s. This reshaped the local church from a teaching/pastoral center into an evangelistic hub.

However, the crucial distinction between apostolic and evangelistic ministries is often blurred. Confusing evangelism with apostolic ministry undermines the unique, underdeveloped apostolic task.

---

## Key Differences Between Apostles and Evangelists

To understand both ministries and their relationship, consider the following distinctions:

- **Apostle**: Extends Christianity as a holistic faith system; advances and establishes the church in new contexts; catalyzes movement primarily through mission and church planting.
- **Evangelist**: Recruits to the cause by catalyzing faith in Jesus; adds adherents to the movement through conversions.

Their differing motivations and outcomes are evident, for example, in Bill Hybels' Willow Creek—focused more on evangelism (“soul winning”) than church planting (an apostolic marker).

### Organizational Design: Addition vs. Multiplication

- **Evangelistic Leadership**: Designs organizations for mass communication and integrating converts; tends to follow an “addition” model.
- **Apostolic Leadership**: Structures for mobilizing converts into mission, extending the church’s reach; favors “multiplication” and exponential growth.

For instance, the American megachurch is largely a result of evangelistic leadership: it brings in new converts but may lack effective multiplication of disciples and communities. When inspired by apostolic concepts of multiplication (e.g., multisite, church planting), these movements shift from addition to multiplication as their core paradigm.

---

## Orbits of Influence

Ministries differ in their natural orbits/zones of influence:

- **Evangelists**: Typically work closely with local congregations, serving as recruiters to the cause and gatekeepers for new people. Their effectiveness declines as they move further from their cultural context.
- **Apostles**: Operate furthest from the movement’s epicenter, engaging new contexts and cultures—often as pioneers on the edge of the movement.

> "Apparent similarities can be deceptive. Both mice and elephants have four legs, a tail, and a mouth, but they are clearly not the same animal."

Entrepreneurial skill can be present in both apostles and evangelists, but this does not make the roles interchangeable.

---

## Culture Creators, Engagers, Redeemers

While evangelistic renewal brought church growth over the past 40 years, the church in the West now operates in a largely dechurched, even unchurched society. Mere evangelistic outreach is insufficient; apostolic (missional) approaches are required for this missionary context.⁶ Applying evangelistic solutions to fundamentally missionary problems is a category error, especially when clarity and strategy are required.

## Contrasts: Apostolic vs. Evangelistic Impact

| Category                 | Apostolic                            | Evangelistic             |

# The Spatial Profiles of APEST

Each ministry type tends to influence and operate within different orbits of the church:

- **Shepherds**: Most localized—thrive when deeply attentive to known individuals and situations.
- **Teachers**: Slightly broader, but typically prefer stable, familiar settings (e.g., seminaries).
- **Evangelists**: Supralocal—connect gospel, converts, and local community, but rarely cross-cultural.
- **Prophets**: Require critical spiritual distance from the center to speak with objectivity, yet remain committed to the people of God.
- **Apostles**: Most translocal—naturally oriented toward the boundaries, pioneering new contexts.

Shepherds and teachers are operative and integrative; evangelists, prophets, and apostles are generative and adaptive—providing fresh insights and adaptability by functioning toward the edge.

---

## Pioneers and Settlers: Managing Missional Tension

The metaphor of pioneers (apostles, prophets, evangelists) and settlers (shepherds, teachers) describes the creative tension within APEST:

- **Pioneers**: Chart new territory, join God's wide-reaching mission.
- **Settlers**: Guard and develop what has been gained, anchor transformation.

Both are necessary. Without pioneers, no new ground is gained; without settlers (or “developers,” per 3DM), gains are not kept. Leadership must harness this tension creatively to ensure both the extension and maintenance of the church's mission.

> "Without pioneers, we rarely, if ever, gain new territory. Without settlers, we rarely, if ever, keep the new territory."

---

# A Missional Dialectic: Progress Through Tension

Adaptive movements recognize the vital but tense relationships within the APEST typology. Every arena requires both progress and restraint—accelerators and brakes.

> "The healthy, mutually enriching, but always tense relationship between the prophet and all the others is vital for spiritual health."

For the church, the pioneer needs the settler, and vice versa, in order to live under Christ’s lordship and become the mature, transformative movement He intended.

> "We are better together than we are apart. Therefore, we must seriously strive for the unity of the Spirit in the bond of true peace (Ephesians 4:3)…"

---

# Missional Ministry for a Missional Church: Where Everyone Gets to Play

> "In the New Testament, no individual Christian is specifically identified as a priest. Jesus is called a priest, and the church as a whole is a royal priesthood, but there was no particular group of priests in the New Testament church."

The clergy-laity divide is a major obstacle to the church’s missional vocation, creating a false notion that only "ordained" people have legitimate roles in leadership and ministry.

This chapter explores how APEST can be incorporated into the very fabric of the church, from foundational discipleship to leadership development and team dynamics.

---

## Between Differentiation and Integration

Leadership must negotiate the natural tension between **differentiation** (recognizing and legitimizing the unique strengths of each APEST vocation) and **integration** (building access and interaction among roles).

### Differentiation

- Development of unique language, aptitudes, skills for each vocation.
- Each role sees how its uniqueness benefits the whole.

Strategic efforts—including deliberate use of APEST language—are needed to foster social intelligence and organizational culture that supports differentiation.

### Integration

- Building meaningful relationships and access among roles for learning, equipping, and collaboration.
- Requires humility and an other-centered spirituality (cf. Ephesians 4:1–2).

#### Common outcomes based on balance:

- **Competing**: High differentiation, low integration—leads to unhealthy competition.
- **Congregating**: Low differentiation, low integration—people simply coexist.
- **Cloning**: Low differentiation, high integration—roles are determined by charismatic or organizational needs.
- **Collaborating**: High differentiation, high integration—diversity is celebrated and harnessed for common mission.

## Base and Phase: The Pathway to Maturity

Mike Breen and 3DM describe the differentiation-integration dynamic as “base and phase.”

- **Base Ministry**: The gifting you operate from naturally; you cannot help but do this.
- **Phase Ministry**: An area where you intentionally develop skills and maturity, often in response to God's call or circumstantial necessity.

This aligns with the Ephesians 4 concept of equipping (katartismo), which means to link together, restore, and integrate different parts for maturity.

Modern leadership theory affirms the value of diverse relationships and developmental networking for growth.

> "Not everyone is a teacher, but everyone is called to share what they know from the scriptures; not everyone is a shepherd, but we are all called to care; not everyone is an evangelist, but we are all called to share the good news; not everyone is a prophet, but we are all called to listen to God; not everyone is an apostle, but everyone is called to live a sent life."

### Phasing In/Phasing Out

- Disciples enter new ministry phases either by felt need or external requirement.
- Real competence develops by exposure to those gifted in that area, often through apprenticeship or mentoring.

Paul teaches that the gifting and capacity for each ministry (metron, or measure) is distributed in differing degrees across individuals. Everyone contains the full potential, but unique combinations express themselves differently.

## It’s All in the Genes: APEST in Every Believer

Every believer contains the full coding for APEST (like DNA in every cell). Though a person may operate from a particular base, all five ministries are resident, accessible, and necessary for fulness of maturity.

Building your own APEST profile helps clarify gifts and areas for growth. Working through this in community fosters self-awareness and integration.

Human beings are never one-dimensional; our ministries reflect the interplay of layered vocational dynamics.

---

## Variety for Adaptivity: The Law of Requisite Variety

For the Body to adapt and thrive in a complex environment, its internal diversity (APEST) must at least match the complexity of its surroundings (“law of requisite variety”).

A fivefold APEST ministry matrix contains the requisite diversity for ecclesial and missional effectiveness. There are, in fact, 120 possible APEST combinations when primary, secondary, and tertiary gifts are considered. Embracing this diversity produces what might be called a quantum vision: dynamic, adaptive, creative problem-solving.

> "If you always do what you have always done, then you will always get what you have always gotten."

---

# Embedding the Codes: Implementing APEST in the Church

The most effective way to access the fulness of APEST is to embed it at every level of church life:

- **Discipleship**: Everyone discovers their base through exposure to all five ministries.
- **Leadership**: Each ministry is represented on core teams and developed intentionally.
- **Formation**: Teams and groups are built around ministry types for prayer, social justice, outreach, teaching, pastoral care, etc.

For example, the prophetic team focuses on prayer, justice, discernment, and spiritual renewal. The shepherding team develops community, worship, counseling, and soul care. Each ministry releases missional communities led from their unique strengths.

---

## Conclusion

A church that values, nurtures, and integrates the diversity of APEST will be more mature, adaptive, and missional. By releasing every believer's potential and creating pathways for growth and partnership between the ministries, the church can represent the fullness of Christ to the world.
