---aspect of New Testament ministry that seems to fly in the face of the human urge to control. And yet it is precisely this all-too-human attempt to determine our own destinies that lies at the root of organizations that so easily become ends in themselves. This human struggle with pneumatocracy highlights the often vexing relationship between organizations and the people who lead them. The general rule is that over time, vision and mission are increasingly downgraded in the name of management and administration. In other words, increasing bureaucratization seems to be the rule. As we have seen, this arises because as organizations grow through their life cycle, unless they are very intentional about it, they will almost always tend toward a state of equilibrium. Following the ordinary course of events, organizations become increasingly internally focused and progressively more risk averse. The felt needs of safety and security that subsequently dominate the community’s concern ultimately shape the kind of leadership the community seeks and validates. And so the organization generates the type of leaders it thinks will best cater to the felt needs of the community in its devolving state. Religious sociologist Peter Berger describes this phenomenon of bureaucratization: “Bureaucracies demand specific types of personnel. This personnel is specific not only in terms of its functions and requisite skills, but also in terms of its psychological characteristics. Institutions both select and form the personnel they require for their operation. This means that similar [bureaucratic] types of leadership emerge in the various religious institutions, irrespective of the traditional patterns in this matter.”18 In other words movements, which are created by more generative types, increasingly 264 appendix become bureaucracies, which increasingly become self-selecting and selfreinforcing systems. As a result, unless the leadership of the organization is intentional about resisting this deterioration with significant resolve, leadership will inevitably become increasingly bureaucratic in nature. This trend is well documented and accepted in the field of social studies. For instance, leadership consultant Lawrence M. Miller has identified certain critical stages of the lives of organizations, businesses, and movements and the seven leadership styles that dominate during each stage.19 He notes that as the organization moves from being founded and led by the generative types (he calls them prophet, barbarian, builder/explorer, and synergist), power subsequently shifts to the more operative/maintenance type of leader (what he calls the administrator, bureaucrat, and the aristocrat).20 This squares well with our understanding of the exiling of the generative (APE) functions in favor of the more operative (ST) types.21 But as Berger indicates, when organizations become increasingly security oriented and more bureaucratic, they tend to suppress the more disturbing original message and mission that generated the organization in the first place. SUMMING UP. Perhaps we can sum up institutionalization processes this way: although to some degree inevitable, it was not theologically scripted in the New Testament itself but rather has more to do with sociopolitical dynamics. The eventual winners in this process of institutionalization rewrote the ministry codes as to what was considered acceptable or not. The apostolic functions (along with the prophetic and evangelistic ones) were edited out of the codes. The resultant Christendom system seldom demonstrated the motivation or the will (political, theological, or otherwise) to adjust it back to fit the biblical categories. Not only was this exiling unnecessary and detrimental to the health of the movement, it lent itself to religious institutionalism that became the entrenched form of the church. We illustrate the process of institutionalization in Figure A.1. Our point in outlining this “movement-to-museum” aspect of church history is to show how the foundational, pioneering, translocal, and custodial leadership of the apostolic ministry was eventually eclipsed by the more local, increasingly maintenance-oriented leadership roles of bishops, elders, and deacons. There irony is painful and costly: the local Christian communities (modalities) that owed their existence to apostolic pioneers (sodality) in the first place effectively rejected their apostolic heritage and thereby undermined their own capacity to generate and maintain authentic apostolic movements. The chaordic dynamics of the early Jesus appendix 265 Generative leadership forms exiled Generative and Operative Operative leadership leadership forms forms movements were replaced by an often oppressive ecclesial system that was to become known as Roman Catholicism. The Reformation, while rescripting our theology of salvation, failed to deconstruct the embedded Christendom paradigm of the church, and so it still rules the thinking of the vast majority of Protestant churches today. Missiologist Ed Stetzer rightly points out, “When the Reformers (and later evangelicals) deemphasized the apostolic nature of the church, they inadvertently lessened the sending nature of that apostolic church. The church that ‘reformed’ lost touch with the God who sends, and the mission of the church suffered.”22 And while we fully recognize that history is always more complex than what a diagram can convey, nonetheless this pretty much tracks the trajectory of the church from the more organic early forms to the much more institutionalized forms of Christianity associated with the Christendom paradigm.23 And sadly, this categorization fits all too well with the current decline of the European church. In previous eras, Christendom retained complete dominance through its direct association with the state. However, once the processes of secularization were introduced by the French Revolution and increasingly adopted throughout Europe, the church’s hegemony was broken, and it has been in decline ever since. Apart from the basic fact that the church belongs to the Lord Jesus and that he will achieve his purposes in spite of us, the fact that Christianity in the West has at times grown at all can be traced to the all-too-brief emergence of generative forms of ministry and leadership that usher in new missional movements and the associated movements of renewal. 266 appendix In spite of the marginalization from the centers of ecclesial power in the church, APE types have been largely responsible for any real kingdom advance through the church: witness the work of St. Francis, Count Zinzendorff, Ignatius Loyola, John Wesley, William and Catharine Booth, R. A. Torrey, Alexander Campbell, Aimee Semple McPherson, and others). God is still at work in his church, and the most fruitful aspects in terms of missional impact have most often come from so-called upstarts: people and movements that have been pushed to the margins of the church but have nonetheless been used by God to extend the kingdom and to bless the broader church. Orthodoxy Versus Orthopraxy: How Apostolic Doctrine Supplanted Apostolic Practice Another distinctive feature that accelerated the institutionalization of the church, and the marginalization of the apostolic function along with it, was the effective substitution of impersonal apostolic doctrine for the active and living ministry of the apostolic person. This process was grounded in distinct historical experiences as the burgeoning church engaged with nonbiblical worldviews. As the Jesus movement began moving into the maintenance phase, the relative stability, along with the dominant needs of the day, initiated a shift in leadership type that favored a more distinctly theological-philosophical response to the threats of heresy together with a pastoral one to deal with the dissension that threatened to damage the integrity of the church. The message of a crucified and risen messiah exploded onto the scene immediately after Jesus rose from the dead, and for approximately seven years, it managed to avoid any significant controversy related to the content of the message itself. It was not until the conversion of the Gentiles that we see any substantial conflict about the gospel itself, along with its implications for missional expansion.24 This was to be the beginning of the many theological controversies for the Jesus movement in the first century. The apostles subsequently dealt with issues of legalism, Jewish nationalism, asceticism, occultism, early Gnosticism, and various other ideologies and influences that found their way from the pagan religious and ideological context into the nascent communities. Furthermore, as the Jesus movement expanded in the second and third centuries, churches were now almost exclusively non-Jewish in ethnicity and context. As a result, the essentially Israel-shaped basis of Christianity was now confronted with a host of alien, extrabiblical ideas and doctrines all competing for dominance in the Christian mind. Perhaps the major appendix 267 threat came from the Gnostic interpretations of Christ, but other issues relating to canon, authority, the nature of God, Trinity, and so forth also presented the fledgling underground movement with challenges. Except for some bloodletting and name-calling, by and large the theologians handled the issues well, and the pastors kept the church pretty much intact. But for obvious reasons, orthodoxy, understood here sociologically in terms of the codification and standardization of belief and behavior, became the driving concern for the church. In order to survive these heretical threats, church leaders looked for a fixed, legitimate, and authoritative source of teaching. Being rightfully viewed as the authoritative sources of the church, the writings of some of the original apostles (including Paul), became the cornerstone on which the New Testament canon would be built. In this process of establishing the much-needed canon, we can also discern the roots of the later idea that was to become known as apostolic doctrine. It was this understanding of the nature of doctrine itself that was later used to justify the eventual abrogation of the apostolic function itself. By overlooking the critical functional role that apostles (as people) play in generating and sustaining movements, and believing that they had somehow successfully extracted the essence of their teachings, the church leaders at the time questioned whether apostolic ministry itself was still needed. Clearly they concluded that it was not. Like a caravan of intrepid explorers pioneering across the wilderness, the church did what might be expected when under attack: they circled their wagons and focused their energies on repelling the impending threats and keeping unity in the ranks. But defensiveness, although necessary at times, ought not to be the church’s primary stance, at least not in the advancing church of Jesus Christ. Jesus never intended that we be primarily a defensive agency but rather one on the offensive (Matthew 16:18). As a pioneering voyage, it is a strategic mistake to allow a temporary interruption to undermine the fact that it is a journey after all, and that a journey is not over until the voyagers reach their destination. The turning point was not so much that they had to circle their wagons—this is to be expected on occasions in all journeys of exploration. The pivotal moment came when the kind of leadership needed for that crisis became the permanent definition of what legitimate leadership in the church looked like. The expansive pioneers were exchanged for the more defensive home builders, and a different form of leadership began to dominate the consciousness of the church. The die was thus cast. But the shift in emphasis toward purely doctrinal issues and church conformity altered the trajectory of Christianity 268 appendix from being primarily conceived as a missionary movement with a transformative vision for society toward being a more defensive and selfreferential community of believers. And so although the development of orthodoxy was clearly the right thing to do, the mistake was to throw the apostolic baby out with the bathwater as if the two could not coexist. Certainly they had to this point—and to great effect. Furthermore, we suggest that not only could they exist together, they actually should exist together. That much is clear in the New Testament model itself. The demise of the apostolic function tilted the leadership balance in favor of the operative (maintenance) types. This also meant that the driving missional emphasis (embodied in apostolic ministry) was effectively displaced, with an ever-increasing emphasis placed on the role of doctrine. Another result was the move away from the chaordic, decentralized networking associated with the movemental forms. What we ended up with is all the increasingly centralized authority of bishops, who favored more bureaucratic, hierarchical, high-conformity forms characteristic of the Roman culture then and Christianity now. None of this is indicated in the teachings of the New Testament itself. On the contrary, the scriptures suggest an organically integrated ministry made up of at least fivefold forms, without which, we are warned, we cannot possibly mature. And there is nothing to indicate that certain elements of the church’s ministry were to pass away while the others would abide forever. Only a highly deductive and prejudiced reading of the New Testament can come to that understanding. It was purely human choice, historical circumstance, and sociopolitical forces that determined this outcome. We can no longer afford to delude ourselves into thinking that simply believing apostolic doctrine is going to be enough. If theological ideas were enough to create a mature church and usher in the kingdom, it would surely have happened by now. We have literally hundreds of millions of words of theology stored up in our libraries. For too long, we have allowed ourselves to be deceived into thinking that because we advocate apostolic doctrine that we are somehow going to automatically be an apostolic church. History has proven this to be patently false: having millions of theological books has not kept us from being profoundly heretical at times. God save us from thinking that another volume of systematic theology is going to fix things up. It is not that we do not believe in the power and necessity of good doctrine: we have already fully recognized the central importance of theology for the health of the church. But doctrinal integrity is more than adequately provided for within the holistic fivefold ministry itself. Apostolic custodianship over the genetic codes, the prophetic concern appendix 269 for covenantal faithfulness to God, the teacher’s rigorous commitment to understanding what has been revealed, the evangelist’s commitment to truth telling, and the pastor’s commitment to personal development and cohesion all collaborate to ensure that the Jesus movement stays on track. Furthermore, if pastoral approaches alone could resolve the issue of the church, we should have gotten it after thousands of years of pastoral ministry. Patently it is not enough: people are still hurting, we lack discipleship, the church is in long-term decline, many are bored, and most churchgoers complain that they do not get enough “feeding.” There is not a preaching series or counseling program in existence that will fix these. Surely if that was the case, we would have had the solution by now. Perhaps even improving pastoral and didactic programming adds to the problem by disguising the real dysfunctions in the system. We do not suggest removing these ST influences, but simply complementing and supplementing them with more generative forms. However we configure it, the situation of contemporary Christianity has utterly changed from that of the Christendom era, when the church completely dominated the religious and cultural landscape. Not only are we experiencing what is legitimately called a post-Christendom, postChristian culture, but we are in a situation where people are increasingly antagonistic to Christianity. In other words, we are now back in a distinctly missionary situation, and although we still have some heresies to fight, the overwhelmingly strategic issue is the survival, let alone the advance, of Christianity in the West. This requires a recovery of apostolic imagination and practice—nothing less. Out from the Cold: The Return of the Apostolic If at an early stage and for various sociopolitical reasons, the church opted to expel the apostolic ministry (and the APE ministries with it), did it entirely disappear? Did the vocation itself, as a calling by God, cease? Clearly not. Institutions, although they can delegitimize, cannot snuff out callings because they are ultimately derived from God, and God exists beyond any restrictions imposed by human will. As a result, the influence of apostolically gifted people is clearly evident in every missional movement in the history of the church. Along with the examples already given, here are some other more easily recognizable examples from all over the world:25 Columbanus, one of the key Celtic monastics, planted more than one hundred monasteries across Europe, which then sent thousands of church planters out across Europe. 270 appendix St. Martin of Tours, known as the founder of Western monasticism, inspired the Celts to found missions and monasteries. He is sometimes called the patron saint of Europe because of his passionate missional vision and work. Saints Cyril and Methodius pioneered the mission to convert the Slavic peoples. Saint Hilda, the abbess who hosted the synod of Whitby, played a major role in the extension of the Celtic movement. Her apostolic influence extended to leaders, nobles, and kings. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, in his own lifetime had missionaries going to India, Japan, and South America, in addition to various parts of Europe. His writings are thought to have partly influenced Wesley. Henry Venn invented the now famous and profoundly apostolic three-self principles and influenced the development of indigenous missions just about everywhere. Hudson Taylor’s work with the China Inland Mission is credited with laying the foundations for the growth of the Chinese church today. Bishop Crowther is the first African bishop; he has indelibly shaped West African Christianity. Joan of Arc was credited with bringing modern France into being. A very influential teen! Mary Slessor was a remarkable missionary who deeply influenced the course of West African missions. John Lake and P. Le Roux are thought to have shaped most of African Independent Church development in southern Africa. Nicholas Bhengu, referred to as the South African Billy Graham, personally planted more than one thousand churches and is thought to have inspired and fathered those who planted tens of thousands of churches. Enoch Adeboya is the father of the fastest-growing denomination in the world today: the Redeemed Christian Church of God. Aimee Semple McPherson was an outstanding female apostolic influence in early Pentecostalism. She founded the FourSquare movement. Gladys Aylward was a missionary in China whose exploits were made into a Hollywood blockbuster, The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, starring Ingrid Bergman. So much for the founders of massively influential movements. But where apostles have managed to operate within the confines of the appendix 271 established churches, they have done so with minimal recognition and legitimacy, operating surreptitiously under the radar. Other than that, they have been dormant within the community and have tended to express their gifting outside explicit ecclesial settings: in commerce, aid and development work, and other secular contexts where ideation, design, and entrepreneurialism are valued. And so the official exile from the church is very real. Those who do not fit the standard ministry profile are made to feel that there is something wrong with them or that they are of no value to the church. When they assert themselves, they are easily labeled as recalcitrant or immature. It is largely because of their impatience with the status quo that they are so labeled, but ironically (as we shall see) it is precisely this holy unrest that constitutes their distinctive gift to the church—contemporary or otherwise. Evangelical Covenant Church missiologist Kyle J. A. Small propheti- cally challenges the status quo of his denomination: Apostolic has a rich identity, offering both the commitment to God’s history, and a vision for participation in God’s future. It is an actionoriented image rooted and centered in God’s larger story. On the one hand, apostolic keeps to the inherited faith of the church. On the other hand, apostolic means commitment to the edges. Apostles refuse to leave any stone unturned and are willing to explore new ideas and territory. Apostles yearn to see where God is acting in the world: even more, they invite the People of God to join them in these spaces. Ordination becomes a living into addressing the leadership deficit that was first perceived in the Book of Acts The office of the apostle needs to continue today in the leadership of the church. Ordained leadership needs to be recruited and formed with a disposition for apostolic imagination.26 And so the challenge stands. We have huddled and cuddled, taught and preached, the church to near death. It’s time to grow up! It’s time to allow some holy chaos to enter so we can break loose from the iron cages of oligarchy and engage the missional challenge to extend the gospel in this century. Inviting disequilibrium will help us deepen and broaden our understanding and practice of ministry in Jesus’s church. A recovery of apostolic gifting means that the church of Jesus Christ, in all its expressions, will begin to open itself up to a more missional, definitely more movemental, and, we hope, a more faithful future. notes ‌Foreword D.

Mike Breen is also considering updating his previous, somewhat more personal, reflections on this subject: The Apostle’s Notebook (London: Kingsway, 2002). These will provide excellent corroboration with our book. This prevailing paradigm is largely a by-product of the two-fold ministry structure of the shepherd and teacher. We address this in the chapters in Part One, but for now we merely allude to the fact that the other three roles— apostle, prophet, and evangelist—have been effectively exiled from the ministry matrix of the church and therefore significantly alter our conception of what the church is and can be. Introduction: The Crisis of Infertility and What to Do About It All the major research agencies report declining attendance and conversion. The Pew Report, Barna Research Group, Ed Stetzer, and others are 274 notes in general agreement about the overall characteristics of this trend. USA Today ran an article in March 2009 that highlighted the research of the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) that gives a graphic interpretation of this trend: “The percentage of people who call themselves in some way Christian has dropped more than 11% in a generation.” To put this decline in perspective, the article said that “despite growth and immigration that has added nearly 50 million adults to the U.S. population, almost all religious denominations have lost ground since the first ARIS survey in 1990.” “Most Religious Groups in USA Have Lost Ground, Survey Finds,” USA Today, Mar. 17, 2009, http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/200903-09-american-religion-ARIS_N.htm. Quoted in T. Ahrend, In This Generation: Looking to the Past to Reach the Present (Colorado Springs: Dawson Media, 2010), p. 172. The sobering truth is that this decline, along with the full potential of the future decay, set in when the church failed to reform itself in accordance with its greater mission. Those who cannot deliver the transformational message of the gospel eventually will be forced to doubt the veracity of the message itself. Theological and ethical doubt generally follows after operational doubt. See D.

Gladwell, Outliers: The Story of Success (New York: Hachette Book Group, 2008). Acts 1:8. Not only is this missional trajectory inherently movemental, it is also exponential in nature. The movement starts locally and mushrooms into a global phenomenon. We recognize that Leon Trotsky also used the “permanent revolutionaries” phrase to describe the ongoing need for renewal in the communist notes 275 revolution. In many ways, he was trying to incite the same capacity for ongoing development and renewal of the communist order. Chapter One: Activating the Theo-Genetic Codes of APEST Ministry This is the clear-cut claim of one of my (Alan) books: The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos, 2007). It proposes six elements that together create apostolic movements. All six will be present in every movement that hits the power band of exponential growth patterns (such as that of the early church and China). One of these relates to APEST, or fivefold, ministry. If APEST is removed, a fully fledged apostolic movement is impossible. There are nevertheless some excellent pieces of reflection in articles, books, and commentaries: Markus Barth’s commentary on Ephesians is one of them, as are an excellent piece by Darrell Guder, the short articles by Robert Clinton (they can be found on his Web site: http://jrclintoninstitute.com/), and some reflections by former Princeton seminary president John A. Mackay in his book God’s Order (New York: Macmillan, 1957). Doubtless there are more, but they are largely incidental pieces written as part of larger works on other topics. Dowsett’s reflections on the missio Dei, kingdom of God, and Creation (on which he did his doctoral dissertation) helped him see that God was always preveniently involved in the world even before his church joins him in that mission.

Dowsett, “Recovering the Five-Fold Ministry of the Local Church,” unpublished doctoral dissertation, St. John’s College, Nottingham. Ephesians 1:22, 3:10, 21, 5:23–25, 27, 29. Also, some distinct textual clues in Ephesians support this notion that it is a generic letter, intended to be circulated and read by multiple churches. For example, elements that typically characterize many of Paul’s other letters are not included in the text. Things like personal greetings, an axe to grind about a particular false teaching, and the addressing of specific problems uniquely related to a particular community, are all staple features of Paul’s letters, and yet they are curiously absent from Ephesians.

Farjoun (eds.), Organization at the Limit: Lessons from the Columbia Disaster (Cambridge, Mass.: Blackwell, 2005), p. 103 C. Wright Mills made the same observation about vocabularies: “A vocabulary is not merely a string of words; immanent within it are social 276 notes textures—institutional and political coordinates. Back of a vocabulary lie sets of collective action.” C. W. Mills, “Language, Logic, Culture,” in J. Beck, C. Jenks, N. Keddie, and M.F.D. Young (eds.), Toward a Sociology of Education (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction, 1978), p. 520. Ocasio, “The Opacity of Risk,” p. 109. In relation to our use of the term vocation or callings, theologian Jack Deere states that apostleship is a calling, not a gift or an especially gifted or powerful person. See his Surprised by the Spirit (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 1993), pp. 242–243. Many have argued that APEST actually constitutes a fourfold ministry because the conjunction between the shepherd and the teacher might indicate that this is the case. We are not convinced from the text itself or from experience. There are many teachers who are not pastors, and vice versa. But, in fact, for our purposes, it does not matter at all. Some readers may prefer to join the role of the shepherd to that of teacher, and that is fine with us It is interesting to note that Paul uses the verb form for the word truth in this verse. It literally should read truthing. The implications of the text lead us to believe that without the fivefold, we will access only a limited perspective on the faith. Each of the APEST ministries offers a unique perspective on Jesus, thus enriching our overall understanding of Jesus and the gospel. Paul addresses ethics and morals in the rest of Ephesians 4 and in Ephesians 5. The word kataptismo has nuanced meanings because it is used to describe several activities that essentially achieve the same result. The word is also used to describe the mending of fishing nets. We will draw insight from this particular contextual use of the word later in the chapter, but the overarching meaning of the word has to do with adding aptitude or capacity to something. See G. Kittel (ed.) and G. W. Bromiley (trans.), Theological Dictionary of the New Testament (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1964), p. 475. A. G. Patzia, “Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon,” in The New International Bible Commentary (version, commentary verse 4:11). CD. J. Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion (J. T. McNeill, ed., and F. L. Battles, trans.) (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1960), 1057. Quoted in D. Guder, “Walking Worthily: Missional Leadership After Christendom,” Princeton Seminary Bulletin, n.s., 2007, 28, 276. A. Roxburgh, The Missionary Congregation: Leadership and Liminality (Harrisburg, Pa.: Trinity Press, 1997), and his “Missional Leadership: Equipping God’s People for Mission,” in D. L. Guder, Missional Church: A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1998). Paul suddenly includes himself in the discussion here. He moves from, “I urge you,” in 4:1 to, “But to each one of us,” in 4:7. Paul is likely doing a play on words here. He just listed the seven “one’s” and is now saying that each “one” of us has received something from the “one” Lord. notes 277 And he gave (didomi) some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some shepherds and teachers. Ephesians 4:7, 11 But to each one of us grace (charis) was given (didomi) according to the measure of Christ’s gift (dorea) Ephesians 3:7–8 ... of which I became a minister according to the gift (dorea) of the grace (charis) of God, given (didomi) to me by the effective working of his power. To me who am least of all the saints this grace (charis) was given (didomi), that I should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ. Grace, given, and gift are the same words that Paul uses to describe how God “graced” him with his apostolic ministry in Ephesians 3:7–8. Notice the comparison between the texts: Once Paul gets to Ephesians 4, it is almost as if he is saying, “Yes, I received grace and a gifting from God, but I am not the only one. Each one of us has received grace according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Each one of us has received a ministry from Christ.” Paul then uses the same language of “each one” in verse 16 where he explicitly says “From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.” Paul brackets his entire discussion of APEST with distinctively inclusive language. For a random sampling of the word in the New Testament, see Matthew 16:27, 18:35; Luke 16:5; Acts 2:8; Romans 14:12; and Hebrews 6:11. M. Frost and A.

Peterson, Practice Resurrection: A Conversation on Growing Up in Christ (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 2010), p. 47. These roles typically evolve into an official position within the movement and contribute to the process of institutionalization through the creation of offices and a centralized leadership structure. We discuss how APEST does this in Chapters Two through Four. For now, we only want to draw attention to the fact that the text makes this claim about APEST. Some scholars believe that the gift of prophesy mentioned in Romans 12 has more to do with preaching, or proclaiming the word, rather than miraculous revelations or prophetic utterances. Chapter Two: An Elegant Solution As we shall see in Part Two, the apostle is the most translocal of all the ministries. Apostles have the most responsibility for the regional cohesion of the 278 notes movement. But they also have to keep strong relational connections to the local churches—hence, our use of the term glocal. See M. Breen, Covenant and Kingdom: The DNA of the Bible (Pawleys Island, S.C.: 3DM, 2010). A. Heschel, The Prophets (New York: HarperCollins, 1969). For this analogy of the canary, we are indebted to P. D. Patton and R. H. Woods Jr., Prophetically Incorrect: A Christian Introduction to Media Criticism (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos Press, 2010). Heschel, The Prophets, p. 21. For an insightful look into how institutions shape discourse, and hence imagination, see M. Douglas, How Institutions Think (Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1986). For instance, church historian David Aune, in his comprehensive study of the nature of the prophetic, notes the complex relationship between the prophetic ministry and the increasing institutionalization of the church: “In the absence of the more complex bureaucratic organization which accompanied the institutionalization of early Christianity, prophets appear to have played a more visible and active role in guiding Christian communities in decision making by reiterating the norms and values which were an integral part of Christian tradition and by providing the communities with visible evidence of the presence and activity of God and Jesus.

Patton and Woods are helpful here: “The impulse of some artistic, passionate, and outspoken members of a church—those, perhaps, with heightened prophetic sensibilities—is to withdraw from the community of believers who might not faithfully support their art or adequately appreciate their outcries over injustice. They may feel free in their isolation, but only for a while. Why? In their seclusion, they end up surrounding themselves only with others who agree with them. As such, they abandon the more complex, demanding, and often frustrating environment of the larger community. Yet sometimes the frustration within the community is the very notes 279 thing that energizes and refines the prophetic sensibility.” P. D. Patton and R. H.

For instance, Kim says, “Would we have embraced the church growth movement as readily as we have otherwise with its goal of ‘bigger = better’? Would we have as uncritically let business world practices, language and ‘job descriptions’ encroach into church life and administration (e.g., ‘executive pastor’)?

Prentice, “Understanding Leadership,” Harvard Business Review, Sept.-Oct. 1961, p. 144. Apostolic ministry, when isolated from the other ministries, operates under the same human restraints as the other callings: it does not give us complete access to a panoramic view of the gospel. But it does provide insight into a foundational part of the gospel that is often displaced: extension. Since the gospel is meant for all, then it is quintessentially apostolic in nature. It is meant to travel across social and spatial boundaries, and apostolic ministry best illustrates this facet of the gospel to us. The missional implications of the gospel, and the trajectory of Christianity as a living system, are functional qualities that find their most vivid demonstration in apostolic ministry. For instance, it is a lot easier to understand Paul as apostle if we begin to see that for him, the gospel was not just a set of propositions to believe but a dynamic spiritual force, a revolutionary movement with a distinct vision, a way of operating, and an agenda—in fact, nothing less than the transformation of the world. This is demonstrated in the universal scope of the gospel as mentioned in Romans 5:18 (“all people”), Colossians 1:19 (“all things”), and 1 Corinthians 15:27–28 (“all things).” At the core of the gospel is a message for all ethnicities, and the apostle’s job is to make sure that this message is faithfully delivered. The wording of the subhead for this section comes from W. Simson, who in his Starfish Manifesto (Oct. 2009), http://en.starfishportal.net, discusses prophetic intelligence for apostolic architecture. For an online copy of the book, go to http://en.starfishportal.net/. We know that the reference to prophets here is not to the Old Testament prophets because apostles did not exist in the Old Testament. The reference here is to the apostles and prophets of the New Testament church, which Paul mentions again in Ephesians 4. Furthermore, we know this text includes apostles outside the twelve and Paul because it alludes to prophets as well. The question is, which prophets? What were their names? If the scope of application for apostles is only the twelve, how do we apply the same metrics of application to the reference of prophets? Surely one foundational category (apostles) cannot be strictly confined to the twelve or Paul, while the other foundational category can be highly ambiguous, with no apparent point of reference. The only conclusion we can come to is that the reference to apostles and prophets as being foundational refers primarily to the ministries that flow out of these functions. The word entrepreneur finds its linguistic roots in Latin and comes from the combination of intrare, meaning “to enter” or “to penetrate in between,” and prehendere, meaning “to grasp or seize hold of.” These two concepts of entering and seizing lie behind the concept of the entrepreneurial mind-set. Entrepreneurial people have the ability to recognize opportunities and act on them with innovative vision and zeal. notes 281 In many ways, this conforms to best thinking in terms of organizational learning, as well as the dynamics of innovation. Learning takes place when programming is subjected to questioning. Serious evaluation, feedback, and some discomfort are necessary prerequisites to learning and innovation. But the key remains the same: asking the right questions. And that is clearly a prophetic function. This process, called anything from “surfing the edge of chaos” to “the burning platform,” is vital to getting existing organizations moving again and is the sweet spot for innovation. In fact, what we now know from the fields of leadership and organizations existed theologically long before in the organization of the church, where it is embedded in our deepest ecclesiological codes. Acts 21 describes a rather confusing encounter between Paul the apostle and Agabus the prophet. Agabus warns Paul of the imminent danger for him in Jerusalem, advice that Paul disregards. The likely interpretation is that because Paul was determined to carry the collection from the Gentiles into Jerusalem, he did not heed this warning and ended up short-circuiting his apostolic ministry through imprisonment. Agabus was trying to provide some direction to Paul’s ministry, but Paul had his own strategy and time line. He was so invested in his personal mission (here, getting to Jerusalem) that it was hard for him to heed the warning of imminent danger. “Who Are These Guys?” New Covenant Ministries International, http:// www.ncmi.net/WhoAreTheseGuys/tabid/54/language/en-US/Default.aspx. “The Order of Mission,” http://www.missionorder.org/. This law, developed by Jane Mansbridge, a sociologist, maintains that “every social movement tends to splinter into sects, unless it wins quickly, in which case it turns into a collections of institutions.” Because the very dynamic that binds people to a movement (its ideology and cause) tends to be idealistic, radical, and exclusive, this will work against them if they cannot produce fruit from their efforts. Their radical exclusivity will inevitably turn on itself. The socialist movement in the United States demonstrates this law. The labor movement turned into an institution and the Communist party into a sect. See J. Goodwin and J. Gasper, The Social Movements Reader: Cases and Concepts (London: Blackwell, 2009). We explore the inexorable association with innovation and the generative APE types in Chapter Four. This shift to evangelism as a local church function has precipitated a major crisis in the parachurches that were set up to do evangelism on behalf of local churches. In many ways, the parachurches arose out of the unfaithfulness of local church leadership to take responsibility for evangelism. The Reveal study stemming from the Willow Creek Association acknowledges this problem. Evangelistic ministry, taken on its own, can precipitate great growth in the church, but it is unsure of what to do with new members once they are integrated into a group and attend regularly. 282 notes Much of the theory and story of the Future Travelers’ learning journey is found in A. Hirsch and D. Ferguson, On the Verge: A Journey into the Apostolic Future of the Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 2011). See ibid. Some point to Phillip as functioning cross-culturally through his travels to Samaria and predominantly Gentile cities, but we have to remember that the name Phillip is thought by most scholars to be a Greek, or Hellenistic, name. It is possible that Phillip, through his family of origin, was already acculturated into, and even developed an affinity for, a more Hellenized context—hence, his selection by the church in Jerusalem to work with the Grecian widows who were being overlooked in the distribution of food. They also selected a proselyte from Antioch, which reveals their bias in selecting people who could relate to those who were not of Hebrew descent. We see this same pattern of retreating to places of solitude in several of the prophets’ ministries in scripture. Moses, Elijah, John the Baptist, and Jesus spent time away from their context of ministry, only to return to that context to speak or act on what they had experienced. Paul Patton and Robert Woods help bring clarity to this issue of critical distance by contrasting the prophet with the traditional understanding of the detached critic: “Prophetic criticism requires critical distance. But how much? In the conventional view, the critic is an unattached spectator, a dispassionate outsider. In contrast, the prophet is a connected critic: someone who is connected to the people she criticizes through a shared tradition and group identity. So, ‘critical distance is best measured in inches, not miles.’” The prophetic ministry is not designed for isolation. Critical distance plays its most effective role when it prepares the prophet to return to the community with fresh insight and critical engagement of his or her context. See P. D. Patton and R. H. Woods Jr., Prophetically Incorrect: A Christian Introduction to Media Criticism (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos Press, 2010), p. 29. R. Rohr, “Life on the Edge: Understanding the Prophetic Position,” Huffington Post, Mar. 26, 2011, http://huff.to/fVm9ET. The Internet and media have changed the reach of teachers, but we suggest that even so, they prefer the stability and predictability that the more stable local church or organization provides. K.

It is articulated through the APEST test (www.apest.org), developed by Alan Hirsch and Brian Schubring of Leadership Vision Consulting, which helps you identify your primary and secondary gifting profiles. Another way of saying it is that in any system of interaction (for example, between individual human beings), the part of the system with the greatest flexibility in its behaviors will control the system. To be sure, when a system increases its complexity, it also increases its ability to engage the complexity of its environment and adapt to its unique challenges. Increasing complexity is tricky business because at some point, too much complexity can become a liability. This is the very thing that overly bureaucratic organizations encounter. Conversely, not enough complexity will limit the organization’s ability to engage the complexity of its environment. Too much or too little can cause any living system to lose its edge and become vulnerable to environmental challenges. All the churches going through 3DM training apply the model, and many others report application. Brandon Schaefer, Discipleship Pastor Southland Christian Church in Lexington Kentucky, has been the point leader for strategically integrating the APEST typologies into their key ministry teams.

Ephesians 4:7–16; Romans 12:1–8. 284 notes There are undoubtedly more metaphors and terms that Paul uses to frame his apostolic role, but these are the most apparent and because of limited space, we limit our observations to these five. Norman R. Petersen provides a stimulating discussion of Paul’s apostolic role in relation to the communities he founds. N. R. Petersen, Rediscovering Paul: Philemon and the Sociology of Paul’s Narrative World (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985). In 1 Corinthians 4:14–21, Paul is not just reminding them of his instrumental role in bringing them into existence as a community through the gospel. This serves only to frame his parental rights to address the sexual immorality in 1 Corinthians 5 that is threatening the purity and overall vitality of the community. Later in the letter, Paul draws further implications from his role as father by drawing from the traditional Jewish marriage customs in which the father of the bride-to-be is charged with safeguarding his daughter’s virginity between the time of their betrothal and the time in which he actually leads her into the bridegroom’s house. As the father of the Corinthians, Paul has a vested interest in seeing them remain pure and undefiled, fully devoted to their husband, Christ, until they are presented to him at the wedding. 2 Corinthians 11:1–2. Jeffrey Crofton addresses the notorious difficulty of sorting out the “we” statements of Paul in 2 Corinthians. He accurately observes that Paul uses “we” in 2 Corinthians as a rhetorical device to “blur the distinction between himself and his apostolic task. The presence of Paul in this letter is almost never that of a singular person. Personal apostleship is consistently swallowed up by generic apostleship. There is no apostolic parousia [presence] form, for Paul desires to reduce rather than promote the actualization of his presence in the letter. The first person singular pronoun is virtually absent; Paul’s consistent use of ‘we’ rather than ‘I’ focuses attention away from Paul the apostle toward Paul and his colleagues, toward apostles in general.” J. A. Crofton, Agency of the Apostle: A Dramatic Analysis of Paul’s Responses to Conflict in 2 Corinthians (Sheffield, U.K.: Sheffield Press, 1991), pp. 66–67.

Economics is not only about value; it is also about the exchange of value. If we can elaborate on Paul’s metaphor here of oikonomia, the gospel is valuable in and of itself in relation to God, but its value is fully realized only when it enters the marketplace and interacts within the economy of human relationships, institutions, society, and culture. Apostles are economists of the gospel because they initiate this exchange and add value through the gospel to our social economies. J. H. Schutz, Paul and the Anatomy of Apostolic Authority (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox Press), pp. 35, 36. notes 285 Ibid., p. 123. What we must realize is that the real power always resides in the gospel itself and that the apostle is always only an interpreter and integrator of its force in the community or movement. The gospel forever remains the ruling concept; all other agents are subordinated to it, including the apostle and the faith community itself. So in Paul’s writings, for instance, not a word is said about the community being directly subordinated to Paul. Rather, because the gospel takes precedence, both Paul and the community can be subordinated to it. Paul can preach only what he has already preached, and the community can receive only what it has already received. The gospel is thus a double-sided standard—both preaching and receiving. It is a standard for authentic faith as well as for authentic apostleship. By virtue of their common dependence on and the need for their obedience to the one gospel, faith and apostleship are brought into the closest possible relationship. Ibid. D. J. Bosch, Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1991). Without the apostolic person (and to a certain extent the evangelist), the gospel tends to move around like a ball in the pinball machine. It may bounce around and reverberate through the system, but it never makes it outside the system itself. M. Breen, The Apostle’s Notebook (Eastbourne, East Sussex, U.K.: Kingsway, 2002). D. Cannistraci, Apostles and the Emerging Apostolic Movement (Ventura, Calif.: Renew Books, 1992). What follows is an elaboration of the material contained in Hirsch, The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos Press, 2006). In my (Alan) centerpiece book, The Forgotten Ways, I suggest that these codes themselves comprise a sixfold complex of distinctive elements, each called mDNA (missional DNA), that together make up apostolic genius—the life force that pulsates through every transformative Jesus movement in history. The six interrelating elements are Jesus is Lord—the heart and soul of Jesus movements, which is the central and organizing element; disciple making—ensuring the embodiment and transmission of the message through adherence to Jesus’s way; the missional-incarnational impulse, describing a way of extending and planting the Jesus movement; an apostolic environment, which explores the nature of the at least fivefold ministry that is the subject of this book; organic systems, which explore the church’s organization as movement and its viral, reproductive tendencies; and communitas, which describes the type of community that forms in the context of ordeal, missional challenge, adventure, and risk. Each chapter in Part Two of The Forgotten Ways explores each of these elements. See also the glossary in The Forgotten Ways, p. 283. For example, it is implied throughout the common use of the indicative and imperatives in the New Testament itself. The indicative creates identity and 286 notes gives this a basis in Christ and his work in the world. The imperatives arise directly out of a sense of who we are in Christ. See Hirsch, The Forgotten Ways. See also O. Brafman and R. Beckstrom, The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations (New York: Penguin, 2006). We acknowledge once again that aspects of this verse refer to the unique role of the twelve apostles. But we, along with others, suggest that something of the foundational aspect of apostolic ministry is inherent in all forms of apostolic ministry. The apostolic function continues to provide something of a catalytic function for the ministry of the people of God. See, for instance, Andrew Lincoln in the Word Biblical Commentary where he notes that the apostles referred to in Ephesians 2:12 encompass the twelve but extend to others who fit the category. “Ephesians,” Word Biblical Commentary, commentary on 2:12. Compact disk. A. Roxburgh, The Missionary Congregation, Leadership and Liminality (Harrisburg, Pa.: Trinity Press, 1997), p. 62. Even the office of the bishop, the institutional replacement of the prior apostolic role, serves as a custodian of apostolicity (viewed here as inherent in the church and in the New Testament scriptures); it is viewed as “having in himself all the other ministries,” which are in turn conferred to others by ordination. See J. McQuarrie, Principles of Christian Theology (London: SCM, 1966), p. 391. In instituting the bishop, Christendom took the pioneer aspect out of the equation, institutionalized apostolicity in church and office, and reshaped it in a distinctly pastoral image to suit the diocesan context, but it did keep some authentic aspects of the apostolic role that were useful to it. This founding role is one of them, and in it a true function of the apostolic can still be discerned.

Adapted from the insights of Mike Kim in “Our Journey into Rediscovering Apostolic and Prophetic Foundations, Part 3,” House2House Ezine, Jan. 29, 2010, http://www.story.house2house.com/2010/01/29/ our-journey-into-rediscovering-apostolic-and-prophetic-foundations-part-3/. Mike Kim says, “Like scaffolding that sticks around beyond its usefulness, leaders often default on staying longer in their role for the sake of ‘ministry quality’ that ends up severely limiting the net quality and quantity of workers in the harvest.” Chapter Six: Come Back, Peter; Come Back, Paul D. Scoggins, “Nurturing a Generation of ‘Pauline’ and ‘Petrine’ Apostles,” Apostolic Ministry, Apr. 4, 2009, http://bit.ly/g3xZKf. It was the nineteenth-century German theologian Martin Kahler who is credited with saying, “Mission is the mother of all theology.” notes 287 Even here, Peter is addressing people with large amounts of religious capital, specifically Jews. So although they may be from different countries and provinces, and consequently different cultural spheres, Peter is still within the orbit of the already existing people of God. “Generally, the opening statement of this Peter cycle reports that the apostle ‘went here and there among all the believers’ or, more literally—‘passed through all of them,’ that is, through all of the areas in the region where believers resided.” F. S. Spencer, Journeying Through Acts: A Literary-Cultural Reading (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 2004), p. 112. The fact that Peter is functioning alone, without any “witnesses” traveling with him (such as the episode in Acts 8 with the Samaritans), shows the generic nature of his ministry in this region. Peter is simply doing what he does best and was commissioned to do by Jesus in John 21. He is feeding the sheep out of an apostolic vision. It is not until Acts 10 that Peter sees the need to take six witnesses with him to Caesarea in order to meet Cornelius, the God-fearing Gentile, and present the gospel to him and his household. It is possible that Peter does the same thing in Corinth in light of the controversies swirling around factional groups claiming “Cephas” as one of their leaders. At any rate, even his interactions with Cornelius reveal that Peter is still interacting within the orbit of people who have significant levels of religious capital, God fearers. This encounter stretched Peter, but it should be noted that Peter is not interacting with Gentile pagans. This kind of cultural distance shows up more visibly in Paul’s ministry. D. E. Myerson, Tempered Radicals: How Everyday Leaders Inspire Change at Work (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2003). Petrine apostles today can take on the form of church consultants. But we need to be clear about this: the impact is not just a more effective operational organization, but rather a more distinctly missional one. And it is not just boosting the church’s evangelistic appeal either. Such apostleship should help mobilize the church for missional and incarnational expressions and, as Reggie McNeal says, “change the scorecard” of what growth and health look like. See R. McNeal, Missional Renaissance: Changing the Scorecard for the Church (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2009). “Intrapreneurship is now known as the practice of a corporate management style that integrates risk-taking and innovation approaches, as well as the reward and motivational techniques, that are more traditionally thought of as being the province of entrepreneurship.” “Intrapreneurship,” http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship.
