---# The Nature of Mission and Renewal

> "It is not so much that the church has a mission but that the mission has a church."

To define Christian mission purely on human terms is theologically inaccurate and misunderstands its nature: mission is rooted in the being and purposes of God. As God's people, our task is to discern what God is doing and to join Him. This perspective shifts the focus from the Church crafting its own mission, to understanding that the mission of God precedes and empowers the Church itself.

## Rediscovering the Primal Purpose

Being the Church that Jesus intended involves participating in God’s eternal purposes for the world. Renewal is more than merely reinventing ourselves; it is about rediscovering the primal power of the Spirit and the gospel already present in the Church’s life—reconnecting with our purpose and recovering forgotten ways. This potential has always existed but has often been overshadowed by layers of tradition, ritual, dogma, and worldliness.

Robert Quinn refers to the rediscovery of our foundational scripts as “discerning the inner voice of the organization,” describing this inner voice as the organization’s moral center. He asserts:

> "[The] articulation of the inner voice of an organization is often the first step toward revitalizing [an organization] and uncovering a vision filled with resonance."

Rather than concocting a mission from scratch, we must listen again to the Church's inner voice, reconnect with our defining scripts, and re-engage with our deepest sense of meaning.

## Petrine Apostleship and Organizational Renewal

Petrine approaches to renewal do not impose a new purpose on their members; instead, they help them rediscover their purpose and train them to listen for the organization’s inner voice. While realigning with this inner voice may threaten the institution’s status quo—often built on self-preservation—it is essential for the ongoing vitality and legitimacy of the Christian movement.

Lawrence Cada, in his study of religious orders, describes the “founding charism” as an order’s unique, gospel-transformed vision of the world. The use of charism (grace) highlights that an organization's purpose is fundamentally a gift—a divine bequest unique to each organization. Recovering this gift means a "return to the sources." Apostolic refounding, therefore, is fundamentally about this return.

Organizational renewal is the process of discovering an organization’s true identity and mission. The authority for transformation comes not from leaders or groups, but from God’s calling. The key to revitalizing religious organizations is to recover and reappropriate their founding charism.
  
Dallas Willard encourages younger leaders to:

> "Stir the primal coals of your movement, do what they did, say what they said."

This is a call to be radical traditionalists—not as a blind return to conventionality, but as an innovative reinterpretation of the founding charism for contemporary expression.

### Radical Traditionalism: Continuity and Innovation

Consider Volkswagen’s reinvention of the Beetle or the Mini: while these vehicles retain continuity with their origins, they are also radically new. This kind of radical traditionalism is also seen in religious renewal movements—such as the return to Wesleyan roots in Methodism or the charismatic renewal within mainline denominations in the 1980s. All apostolic ministry involves this return to the founding message, reinterpreted into new contexts.

Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, in their work on organizational dynamics, advise us to:

> "Preserve the core and stimulate progress."

Revitalization requires both continuity and discontinuity—a conservative dimension and a radical one. Radical traditionalism involves rediscovering the founder’s vision and matching it with innovation.

## Renewal with a Long Tail

Both Pauline founding and Petrine refounding require crafting and living into new organizational practices and rhythms anchored in foundational principles:

- Recentering the Church on its Christological roots
- Developing robust discipleship processes
- Creating leadership development pathways
- Forging new approaches to mission
- Shaping organizational structure for purpose-fit
- Overcoming risk aversion

Because apostolic work is foundational, its most important results often lie beneath the surface, sometimes unnoticeable for long periods. Many fail at this stage not due to a lack of ideas or resources, but due to a lack of perseverance and courage.

### The “Flywheel Effect”

Jim Collins describes organizational progress as a “flywheel effect”:

> "In building a great organization, there is no single defining action... Rather, it feels like turning a giant, heavy flywheel. Pushing with great effort—days, weeks and months of work, with almost imperceptible progress—you finally get the flywheel to inch forward. Each turn builds upon previous work, compounding your investment of effort. This is how you build greatness."

Apparent successes tend to have a long, unspectacular prehistory. For example, the phenomenal growth of the Chinese church after the Maoist revolution was built on foundational, apostolic groundwork laid generations before.

### Laying Deep Foundations

This “long tail” echoes Jesus’s teachings on the kingdom’s slow, subversive growth: seeds becoming trees, yeast leavening dough. Initial insignificance—seen in Christ’s own ministry—may give way to great long-term impact. Patient trust in core ideas (the “DNA”) is paramount.

## Adventures in the Borderlands

Renewal is inherently dialogical, requiring both:

1. Reconnection with central, founding ideas
2. Engagement at the organizational “edges”

The revitalizing move outward—into unknown territory—is essential. Renewal often emerges through “surfing the edge of chaos,” a concept from living systems theory. Engagement with the world forces the Church to interpret and translate its message, catalyzing theological and spiritual renewal driven from the margins.

> "The main stimulus for the renewal of Christianity will come from the bottom and from the edge, from sectors of the Christian world that are on the margins."  
> — W.C. Roof

Historically, movements of mission outside the Church have generated inner renewal. Systemic renewal seldom comes from disengagement or insularity.

### The Edge as the Site of Innovation

Without borderland engagement, organizations become self-reinforcing and resistant to change. Intelligence and decision-making are derived solely from inherited traditions, which eventually become sacrosanct and disconnected from present realities. Real learning and renewal arise from a dialectic engagement—struggles at the edge, where new problems invite innovative solutions.

Donald Schön notes:

> "There are those who choose the swampy lowlands. They deliberately involve themselves in messy but crucially important problems and, when asked to describe their methods of inquiry, they speak of experience, trial and error, intuition and muddling through."

Reflective practitioners who can translate hard-won, edge-derived wisdom into organizational learning are invaluable.

## Drawing Near to God, Taking It to the Streets

Apostolic ministry mediates the vital dialectic of renewal: as “classic edge people,” apostles extend Christianity into new situations, ensuring that the gospel DNA is faithfully transmitted across contexts. As guardians of the DNA, they safeguard foundational truths, recognizing that error at this level mutates all that follows.

> "Preserve the core and stimulate progress."  
> — Collins & Porras

Apostolic ministry is necessary not only for expanding the church’s reach but also for maintaining the health of its home base. Founding any movement in a fallen world inevitably requires refounding.

# The Enterprise of Movement and the Movement of Enterprise

> "The reward of the search is to go on searching. The soul’s desire is fulfilled by the very fact of its remaining unsatisfied, for really to see God is never to have had one’s fill of desiring Him."  
> — Gregory of Nyssa

In eras of great change, those who do not think and act as revolutionaries become victims of events. As Winston Churchill warned:

> "He who rejects change is the architect of decay. The only human institution which rejects progress is the cemetery."

## Lessons from the Frontier: American Westward Expansion

During the earliest days of European settlement in North America, the vast frontier invited adventure. The dichotomy between settlers and pioneers shaped national character—pioneers like Lewis and Clark, through tenacious and visionary effort, opened new frontiers for future generations.

Historian Frederick Jackson Turner argued that the frontier—real or conceptual—fundamentally shaped American identity. Its closing, he warned, potentially signaled the loss of the driving force propelling society forward.

## The Pioneering Spirit in Christian Leadership

Christianity itself is a faith founded by pioneers—Jesus, the “pioneer and perfecter” of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), and Paul, whose journeys modeled groundbreaking apostolic ministry. Apostolic pioneers across history—from St. Patrick to William Booth—embodied courage, resolve, and innovation.

### Characteristics of Pioneers

Pioneers may mobilize the community to explore new edges or move from the organizational center to the edge themselves, facing unique challenges:

#### 1. Ability to Invent the Future While Dealing with the Past

Pioneers live in “in-between times” (the end of Christendom, for instance), recognizing that old maps seldom suffice for new territories. They must chart new paradigms.

#### 2. Willingness to Break with Traditional Ideas and Methods

Frontiers demand innovation; tradition may be helpful in the center, but new contexts demand new forms.

#### 3. Ability to Play Multiple Roles

Pioneers must be chefs and hunters, navigators and map-makers—“leaderplex,” as Robert Hoojberg calls it. Paul serves as an excellent model: planter, architect, ambassador, and cultural adapter.

#### 4. High Tolerance for Risk

Pioneering ministry involves sacrifice and the inevitability of failure—"fail early, fail often" (Thom Kelley).

#### 5. Need to Be Different Despite Pressure for Sameness

Supporters often pressure pioneers to conform to traditional measures of success. Enduring this requires hardiness and ambiguity tolerance.

#### 6. Understanding That Many Want the Pioneer to Fail

Innovative pioneers challenge old assumptions, often meeting resistance or even hostility. Apostolic leaders must break away from certainty and institutional security to create new categories of ministry.

#### 7. Embracing Isolation

Machiavelli wrote:

> "Nothing is more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than achieving a new order of things."

Prophets and apostles are often persecuted and must stand alone for the sake of reform.

## Apostolic Entrepreneurship

Since entrepreneurship is core to apostolic ministry, organizations must create space for innovation alongside proven methods. Both exploitation (leveraging what works) and exploration (seeking new possibilities) are necessary.

### Seven Elements of Entrepreneurial People

1. **Internal Freedom to Explore:** The ability to try new options while anchored to gospel core.
2. **Sense of Holy Dissatisfaction:** The drive to find better ways to advance God’s mission.
3. **Capacity for Ideation:** Combining new concepts and disciplines in creative theological ways.
4. **Ability to Take On Risk:** Implementing new ideas, even at personal cost; action is as important as theory.
5. **Permission and Space to Experiment:** Leadership must create a culture of experimentation and learning from failure.
6. **Dogged Determination:** The resolve to pursue new ideas in the face of resistance and failures (as with Edison’s light bulb, or Paul’s apostolic perseverance).
7. **Innovative Implementation:** Ideation must be coupled with action—dreams alone do not change the world.

### Typology of Entrepreneurship

Based on Morris's model, four types of organizational entrepreneurship can be identified:

- **Nominal:** Low frequency, low innovation. Little sustained entrepreneurial effort.
- **Sporadic:** Occasional bursts of innovation without cohesive vision.
- **Franchised:** Repetition and codification of a single, successful model. High efficiency, low innovation.
- **Dynamic:** Sustained, disruptive, and adaptive innovation that keeps the organization in permanent renewal.

Dynamic entrepreneurship is rare in churches but essential for dealing with disruptive change. The Chinese Church under Communism exemplifies this intensity.

## Balancing Mastery and Originality

James March distinguishes between:

- **Exploration:** Risk, experimentation, innovation.
- **Exploitation:** Refinement, production, implementation.

Both are vital; systems must oscillate between mastery and originality to survive and thrive—a "dynamic disequilibrium" that propels adaptation and growth.

> "When you fall in love with the system you lose the ability to grow."  
> — Seth Godin

Change requires effort and comfort with discomfort—initially, new approaches will seem inferior to old ones. However, innovation is essential for the Church’s ongoing relevance and vitality.

## Dynamic Apostolicity in the Church

Mainline and evangelical churches frequently operate on nominal or franchised models. Innovation initiatives (such as the UK's Fresh Expressions) often remain marginal unless truly embraced by the broader system.

> "We either innovate or continue to experience decline."

The future of apostolic ministry depends on legitimizing innovation—not only at the margins but at the Church’s heart. The appropriate balance of exploration and exploitation will foster systems that are both adaptive and sustainable, ensuring the Church's ongoing movement and renewal.
