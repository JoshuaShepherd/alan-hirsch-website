## Foreword

One of the most compelling indicators that Western Christendom is concluding—or rapidly disintegrating—is the proliferation of broad and diverse initiatives to plant untraditional, post-denominational congregations within Western cultures once defined by Christianity. While remarkably varied, these initiatives share a commitment to experimenting with new forms and styles of community life, consciously distancing themselves from the inherited structures of Western churches. Their practices and patterns of gathering are decidedly countercultural.

Although there is no defined theological consensus among these movements, much of their work is generating significant biblical and theological engagement—both challenging and encouraging. While "convergence" may be too strong a word for what is occurring, there is a clear, mutually constructive theological conversation emerging among theologians such as Alan Hirsch, Michael Frost, Tim Catchim, and various participants in the missional church dialogue. This book is an important resource for that discussion and an engine to propel it further.

The term *missional* entered widespread usage after a small group of missiologists published *Missional Church: A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America* in 1998. The term quickly became ubiquitous—sometimes meaning everything, sometimes nothing. Its original meaning emphasized the calling and identity of the church as God's sent agent in the world. This definition has been recognized and deepened by those pioneering post-Christendom, indigenous churches in the West—such as the authors of this book.

Alan Hirsch succinctly summarized the heart of the missional church proposal in *The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church*:

> *"A missional church is a church that defines itself and organizes its life around its real purpose as an agent of God’s mission to the world. In other words, the church’s true and authentic organizing principle is mission. Therefore, when the church is in mission, it is the true church. The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus."*

In *The Permanent Revolution*, Alan Hirsch and Tim Catchim propose a revolutionary missional ecclesiology shaped by the New Testament’s account of the apostolic missionary strategy. From its inception, the Christian mission focused on forming and calling communities that would continue bearing witness to Jesus Christ—the very foundation of their existence. To reclaim this strategy, Hirsch and Catchim argue that the functions of Word ministry described in Ephesians 4:11—apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, pastoral, and teaching—are essential for the development of authentic, faithful witnessing congregations.

This emphasis is closely tied to a robust critique of Western Christendom’s reduction of these functions to only two: pastoral (shepherd) and teaching. The resulting clericalism is one of the greatest challenges that the Western church movement faces as it moves beyond Christendom’s protections and privileges.

Particularly crucial for missional ecclesiology today is the recovery of the apostolic function. The apostolic ministry ensures the church remains centered on its calling as God’s agent of mission, connecting everything it is and does to that purpose. I share this conviction and have argued that the Nicene marks of the church should be interpreted in reverse order—apostolic, catholic, holy, and one—so that apostolicity defines every aspect of church life and action.

Within the missional church conversation, this conviction intersects with criticism of Western ecclesiologies that substitute mission for institutional maintenance. This book’s focus on apostolicity aligns with the insistence that mission defines the church, broadening and deepening the discussion in highly generative ways. Hirsch and Catchim persuasively argue for a revolutionary ecclesiology from exegetical, theological, organizational, and sociological perspectives. They draw upon diverse insights from organizational behavior and leadership in Western contexts, contextualizing apostolic ministry with research from the world of corporate organizational behavior.

Their bold conclusion is that:

> *"The degree to which a system is willing to acknowledge and legitimize apostolic ministry is directly proportional to its ability to be entrepreneurial and sustain higher levels of entrepreneurial intensity."*

This claim is sure to trigger a spectrum of responses—from critical to laudatory. Such debate may, in fact, be one of the primary merits of this proposal: it raises questions that demand passionate, thorough discussion. The enduring value of this theological model will be measured by the quality of the debate it inspires. This conversation addresses longstanding questions, including:

- The character and role of leadership in the missional church
- How Jesus’s formation of the disciples (in the Gospels) and the apostles’ formation of their churches (in the Epistles) informs our formation today
- The dialectical tension between the church’s dependence on the Holy Spirit and intentional human action in obedience to the biblical mandate
- The appropriate critique and appreciation of the Christendom legacy
- Faithful translation of the gospel in diverse cultures, without assimilation and captivity to those cultures

It is significant that this theological process emerges from secularized, post-Christian cultures such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Even more intriguing is that some of the most vibrant examples of post-Christendom, indigenous Western churches have arisen within highly secular, sometimes hostile, environments. Health-giving theology should emerge from the crucible of faithful, radically obedient mission.

*The Permanent Revolution* exemplifies the kind of theological work urgently needed to "equip the saints for the work of ministry" (Ephesians 4:12)—apostolically, prophetically, evangelistically, pastorally, and instructively.

## Preface: A Briefing for the Journey

> *"Of the making of books there is no end."*

### Why We Wrote This Book

Despite the proliferation of books, there remains a notable deficiency of substantial writing on Ephesians 4 (regarding the roles of apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers—APEST), particularly about the apostolic ministry and person. The real shortcoming lies not in excess but in the lack of thought and reflection. Our guiding objectives are as follows:

#### 1. To Change Minds and Strengthen Others

- **For the Unconvinced:**  
  Our aim is to shift perspectives about the importance of the fivefold ministry, especially the apostolic, for the church today. We believe the future viability of the Western church depends on realigning ministry along more biblical lines. Paradigm shifts are always difficult; nonetheless, we believe it is necessary and long overdue.

- **For the Already Convinced:**  
  For those already persuaded of the need for a broader, apostolically-focused ministry—either by tradition or involvement in the missional movement—we seek to strengthen your case, calibrate practice, correct misconceptions, and provide a stronger biblical and theological foundation.

#### 2. To Rectify Theological Poverty Regarding Ephesians 4 and Apostolic Ministry

From our research, dominant paradigms often either replace the apostolic role with the canon of scripture (Protestantism) or transfer it to bishops and institutional authority (Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy), leaving no contemporary space for the apostolic role. Meanwhile, pragmatic, charismatic approaches tend to lack theological depth and easily become caricatures rejected by scholars and clergy alike. Neither approach is helpful for rediscovering our missional calling.

At present, no single, comprehensive reference text promotes the ongoing role of the apostolic person in the church. This book is at least a beginning remedy.

#### 3. To Change Frameworks

*The Permanent Revolution* is primarily a work of theological (re)imagination and (re)construction, grounded in biblical studies, theology, organizational theory, leadership studies, and social sciences. Our fundamental claim: the church’s capacity to embody and continue Jesus’s mission depends largely on embracing the fivefold ministry. We seek to provide robust theoretical foundations to re-legitimize and restructure ministry accordingly.

Paradigm reframing is difficult; it runs counter to inherited thinking and exposes blind spots. We hope the Spirit will awaken dormant energies within the Western church. Our interdisciplinary approach—embracing theology, sociology, leadership, psychology, and organizational science—reflects our conviction that all truth is God’s truth.

#### 4. To Stimulate Apostolic Imagination Leading to Missional Action

Given the lack of prior writing on apostolic ministry, we have had to exercise theological imagination supplemented by social sciences. We ask readers to approach our ideas as spiritual prods or thought experiments, not prescriptions. Our intention is to inspire, not dictate. Ultimately, our aim is to empower the church as a movement, liberating minds and vocations from existing constraints.

#### 5. Collaboration

This book is a collaboration between us, with Mike Breen assisting in the construction of Part One (on Ephesians and APEST). Most of the book is our own joint effort, with Tim as primary researcher and Alan shaping and directing the project. We use the first person where personal biography is involved, but generally speak with a shared voice.

### A Word to the Wise

> *"It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows."*  
> — Epictetus

We have all been shaped by the prevailing paradigm of church and ministry. We urge you to reimagine ministry with us, even if it contradicts familiar scripts and challenges comfort zones. To truly learn, we must be willing to think differently.

> *"The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education."*  
> — Albert Einstein

Please do not let your prior education prevent you from learning anew. The stakes are high. This book is lengthy because the issues are significant and urgent; we encourage deep, communal engagement.

### Structure of the Book

- **Part One:**  
  Explores Ephesians 4:1–16 as the biblical framework for ministry and the apostolic role, with collaboration from Mike Breen.
- **Part Two:**  
  Focuses on apostolic ministry—defining apostolicity, exploring nuances, and contrasting Pauline and Petrine apostolic models and their missional impact.
- **Part Three:**  
  Examines apostolic leadership, particularly as it relates to missional innovation and entrepreneurship.
- **Part Four:**  
  Addresses apostolic organization, reimagining structures for movement rather than static institutions. The appendix reflects on the exile of the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic roles (APEST) from church life.

We draw on clear historic exemplars—Patrick, John Wesley, William Booth, Aimee Semple McPherson—not because others aren’t equally apostolic, but because their profiles best illuminate our arguments.

## Introduction: The Crisis of Infertility and What to Do About It

> *"The illiterate of the future are not those that cannot read or write. They are those that cannot learn, unlearn, relearn. People in any organization are always attached to the obsolete—the things that should have worked but did not, the things that once were productive and no longer are. He who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality, and will never, therefore, make any progress."*  
> — Anwar el-Sadat

### A Parable of Infertility

In the film *Children of Men*, humanity faces a crisis of infertility; no child has been born in 18 years, hope withers, and society unravels. Theo, the disillusioned protagonist, becomes the custodian of Kee, a miraculously pregnant woman. The future of humanity hinges on their perilous journey. Theo's assignment becomes a matter of existential importance—he is a custodian of life amidst barrenness.

This story powerfully echoes the spiritual infertility afflicting the Western church. Despite centuries of Christianity, we rarely witness the transformation implied in the gospel or the viral, movemental vitality of New Testament ecclesia and historic gospel movements (seen today in the Global South).

All indicators confirm a similar spiral of decline in Western Christianity: numerical and spiritual decrease are widespread.

### A Permanent Revolution? Really?

In this context, critical questions arise:

- What is the church’s true calling?
- Can the gospel renew the world and transform hearts?
- Is the ecclesia a colony of a kingdom, designed for wholesale social renewal, or merely chaplains of a fading Christian civilization?

As Ralph Winter stated:

> *"Every major decision you make will be faulty until you see the whole world as God sees it."*

We believe Jesus designed the church for world-transforming, lasting revolutionary impact—not as a domesticated civil religion. If we are not living as a *permanent revolution*, self-assessment is necessary.

External factors cannot solely explain the church’s decline. Internal dynamics—sin, lack of faith, and the preference for human designs—are primary causes. Acknowledging failure opens space for repentance, renewal, and the search for new structures in line with God’s purposes.

### Doubt and Permanent Devolution

Belief aligns us with God’s purposes. Missional doubt undermines belief, drains spiritual vitality, and precipitates institutional decline—a pattern evident in both biblical Israel and church history.

**The Life Cycle of Doubt in Movements:**

1. **Operational Doubt:**  
   - Problems delivering on missional objectives; organizational forms no longer work.
2. **Ideological Doubt:**  
   - Doubt extends to the core message itself.
3. **Ethical Doubt:**  
   - Behavior changes as core values are lost.
4. **Absolute Doubt (Closure):**  
   - The movement dies.

This cycle is tragically evident in the institutional decline of Western churches, especially mainline denominations. A doubt-filled church lacks resources for growth, relying on failed traditional paradigms.

### Of Black Swans, Algorithms, and Revolutions

The church is equipped with everything needed for its mission—spirit and gospel provide all sufficiency. Failure frequently results from "theological amnesia" and limiting paradigms (algorithms) that may no longer match new environments or challenges.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s concept of “black swan events”—unexpected, paradigm-shifting occurrences—aptly describes much of the church’s recent history. Rigid adherence to outdated algorithms inhibits adaptation, leading to crisis. As Joshua Cooper Ramo observes, our age requires resilience, adaptability, and continual learning.

Merely improving current practices is insufficient; revolutionary adaptation—in strategy and structure—is now essential. The old Christendom algorithms are no longer viable for the church’s changing context.

### Ecclesia as Apostolic Movement

We propose that resolving the church's problems begins with thinking differently about its identity and mission. Drawing from New Testament language, the church (*ecclesia*) is fundamentally an apostolic movement: a radical community of disciples, centered on Jesus, empowered by the Spirit, built on fivefold ministry, organized around mission, decentralized, and with every member empowered for service.

**Four Levels of Ecclesia (Church):**

1. **Local Church:**  
   - Gatherings in homes or public spaces.
2. **Citywide Church:**  
   - A network of house churches or ministries across a city or region.
3. **Translocal Movement:**  
   - The expansion of the movement across cultural and geopolitical boundaries.
4. **Universal Church:**  
   - The global, theological "body of Christ."

This movemental understanding requires reconfiguring leadership and ministry beyond local shepherd-teacher models toward the full collaborative expression of apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and teacher (APEST). New Testament ministry was inherently fivefold, catalyzing dynamic, expanding gospel movements.

### Apostolic Leadership for Missional Movement

Authentic missional churches must express themselves at every level of ecclesia. Leadership must therefore operate at local, citywide, regional, and global levels—no longer restricted to traditional shepherd-teacher functions.

We believe APEST, and especially the apostolic function, is the primary ministry algorithm—a genetic code of the church. Apostolic ministry is the catalyst, unlocking adaptive, pioneering, entrepreneurial, and movemental vitality in the church. Nothing less than church renewal depends on rediscovering this type of ministry.

As the church reformed should always be reforming (*ecclesia reformata et semper reformanda*), so must it embrace "permanent revolution"—a continual process of renewal through the Spirit. Apostles, and all those described in Ephesians 4, are given to the church by Jesus for this ongoing transformation.

If the church narrows its ministry, it inevitably narrows its possible impact. Recovering apostolic ministry is key to sustaining necessary movement and mission in our context. Now is the time—back to the future we go.

## Part One: Ephesians 4:1–16  
### Frameworks for Ministry—Activating the Theo-Genetic Codes of APEST Ministry

> *"The reasons that Sisyphus was apparently condemned by the gods are not entirely clear. What is clear is that his terrible punishment was to roll a huge rock up a steep hill, and then just as he reached the top of the hill, it would roll back to the bottom."*

We begin with futility because, in many ways, the historic church has been engaged in a Sisyphean task. Despite movements of mission and renewal, progress seems repeatedly lost, thwarted by our own divisions or determination to pursue ministry aside from God’s design.

Obedience and love are commands, and their very inclusion presumes the possibility of their fulfillment through actual obedience. Likewise, all New Testament teachings on the church (ecclesiology) imply the sufficiency and potential of God’s people to become what Christ intended. If not, God would be toying with us—a misleading, even cruel scenario.

If we are not embodying Jesus-shaped church, we must honestly assess our practices against the original intention and design. Otherwise, we are doomed to repeat a cycle of fruitless toil that echoes the myth of Sisyphus—endless effort with no lasting achievement.

*To mess with the DNA of the church—that is, its original design and function—is to risk perpetual futility. The following chapters will explore how to recover and activate the essential, missional, apostolic nature of the church so that, in every generation, we may fulfill our calling as the people of God.*
