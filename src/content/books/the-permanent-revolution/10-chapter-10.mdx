---at stake, local disciples and communities became real stakeholders, experts at processing the problems they faced. In this way, they allowed group involvement and participation to constantly deepen. Learning was shared not as a formula or model for others to copy, but as an application of missiological thinking and approaches to problem solving. Steve Addison is right when he says that “centralization and standardization are the enemies of innovation.”18 We have already seen that the truly great organizations do not make their best moves by brilliant and complex strategic planning. What they do is “try a lot of stuff and see what works” and then freely share their learnings with others.19 The concept of local leadership (elders and deacons) itself supports the idea of local disciples being ultimately responsible for witness and health as a Jesus community in their area. When Paul sends members of his apostolic team to help establish elders in the local churches, he is doing precisely this (Titus 1:5). All efforts at helping the local churches get established and grow to maturity involve an increasing transfer of power from the founder to the community that he or she has founded. To do otherwise would be to create dependencies that undermine the idea of the church as the body of Christ, and therefore as an expansive people movement. Although Paul certainly takes a parental interest in the congregations around the empire, he does not (even cannot) dominate or disempower them. Although he does exercise spiritual authority and leadership when it matters, over time he seeks to wean them from his direct influence.20 Self-Generating Each community was responsible for not only its own survival but also for extending the message by evangelizing, discipling, and planting the gospel. A message exists to be passed on, and the church of Jesus is at core a message tribe. This is what the original framers of the three-self principles called self-propagation; the Bible calls it fruitfulness. Both point at the reproductive capacities of the ecclesia. As Neil Cole rather wryly notes, “If you can’t reproduce disciples, you can’t reproduce apostolic architecture 235 If you can’t reproduce disciples, you’ll never reproduce leaders. If you can’t reproduce leaders, you’ll never reproduce churches. If you can’t reproduce churches, you’ll never see a movement. Source: N. Cole, Organic Leadership: Leading Naturally Right Where You Are (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 2009). Used with permission. leaders. If you can’t reproduce leaders, you can’t reproduce churches. If you can’t reproduce churches, you can’t reproduce movements.”21 This is illustrated in Figure 11.2, which shows that reproduction should occur naturally at every succeeding level of complexity, beginning at the smallest, simplest level. It is hard to get around the sheer truth of this. Generativity, involving the commitment to reproduction and reproducibility, must be factored into the base equation of the apostolic movement. The commitment is at the DNA level—as inviolable as genetics is in forming and perpetuating life itself. To leave this out in principle means to end up with an organization or system that, like an infertile mule, not only will not reproduce itself but in fact cannot do so. Most prevailing forms of church cannot be easily reproduced except by professionals, and even then, it is done well only by very few of them. Of the 400,000 churches in the United States, only a few can be considered reproductive and fruitful. For instance, Neil Cole, reflecting on research done by the Southern Baptist research and resource center called Lifeway, notes that only 4 percent of Southern Baptist churches in the United States will plant a daughter church. Extrapolated across the denominations, that means that 96 percent of the conventional churches in the United States will never give birth. Cole goes on to show the missionally perilous misconceptions inherent in this thinking: Many think this is fine. I have heard people say, “We have plenty of churches. There are churches all over the place that sit empty, why 236 the permanent revolution start new ones? We don’t need more churches but better ones.” Can you imagine making such a statement about people? “We have plenty of people. We don’t need more people, just better ones. Why have more babies?” This is short-range thinking. No matter how inflated you think the world population is, we are only one generation away from extinction if we do not have babies. Imagine the headlines if suddenly it was discovered that 96% of the women in America were no longer fertile and could not have babies. We would instantly know two things: this is not natural so there is something wrong with their health. We would also know that our future is in serious jeopardy.22 This failure to think about and organize for the ability of ecclesia to reproduce lies at the root of much of our frustration with the persistent failure of so many church planting projects. There are precious few thirdor fourth-generation church planting movements to be found. And even when some churches manage to plant one or two new churches, they seldom last to the third generation, which is considered the beginning of real movement.23 This is partly because reproduction feels unnatural and the system is way too clunky to be able to easily reproduce. Movements require commitment from the start in order to be selfgenerating. All apostolic movements demonstrate this principle to varying degrees. Self-Sustaining Anyone who has been in leadership very long realizes that finances have a massive impact on how we conceive of and carry out a church, a plant, or a mission project. What few realize, though, is that the reasons are actually counterintuitive to what we normally think. We generally think that the more money we give to a particular mission effort, the more chance it has of succeeding. Actually the opposite is true. Our assumptions once again come from the institutional paradigm of the church, which is building bound and expensive. But that thinking marginalizes the real power of the church—the ministry of all of God’s people in every sphere and domain. Church growth movement founder Donald McGavran warned in 1990: The congregation should be of such structure and pattern that common people can operate it and multiply it indefinitely among the masses. In North America, the indefinitely reproducible pattern is not the highly successful church, led by a very exceptional preacher, apostolic architecture 237 which erects a set of buildings covering a city block and counts its members in the thousands. That is one good pattern in certain situations, but it is impossible in most places.24 It is not possible to reproduce movementally, let alone sustain a movement, if churches require exorbitant amounts of money to start and operate. Our friend and movement expert Steve Addison has long maintained that Christianity flourishes when it is no longer dependent on external organization, funding, and control. He quotes missiologist Wayne Allen, who discovered that the impact of foreign subsidies for national church workers generally has an inverse relationship to the decline or plateau of the national churches.25 There are three reasons for this: Loss of lay involvement. Subsidies resulted in a move away from lay leadership to a reliance on paid professional clergy. Loss of focus. Paid workers subsequently gave less attention to evangelism in unreached villages and more attention to meeting the needs of existing congregations in line with the expectation of the foreign mission agency providing the funds. Loss of devotion. As the people realized that the mission became funding their pastor, they lost a sense of ownership and came to see the pastor as the parent organization’s hired hand. In turn, the hired pastor tended to give greater attention to pleasing the mission organization and seeking salary increases.26 The implications are profound for churches everywhere—not just the developing world. If we hope to activate movements, we have to ensure that we do not lay the seeds of professionalism in the base models we use. We need to keep an eye out for long-term sustainability and ongoing momentum. Remember that every believer is an agent of the King, every son and daughter of the King is a missionary, and our Lord provides for each one in his own way. This is not to say that monies should not be raised and some people paid through centralized sources, but serious care must be taken to avoid the perils that Wayne Allen outlined. Movements must not be dependent on the availability or otherwise of clergy salaries; it is a sure way to stop a viable movement in its tracks. Beyond the issue of money and support, sustainability needs to be able to be carried out by the whole church and not outsourced to experts or a priestly or pastoral caste that almost inevitably replaces and thus marginalizes the priesthood of all believers. Furthermore, methods must be simple enough so they can be reproduced easily, rapidly, and sustainably. Table 11.1 lists some examples of sustainable and unsustainable practices. 238 the permanent revolution Self-Reflective Local disciples and communities need to have the internal tools to analyze, reflect, learn, and adapt without having recourse to some central system that regulates what is, and is not, permitted. Guided by a love for God, the presence of the in-dwelling Spirit, and a deep commitment to the scriptures, God’s people are able to make the right choices and grow to maturity on their own. Fully fund every church plant. Train church planters to raise funds or become tent makers, or both. Require seminary training for every church planter. Multiply trainers in the field. Provide a coach for every church planter. Equip established church planters to coach the next wave of church planters. Provide long-term subsidies for struggling church plants. Allow churches to take responsibility. Parent churches take responsibility for the budgeting and administration of church plants. Empower church plants to set up their own systems. Centrally plan and coordinate where and when churches are to be planted. Expect churches and church planters to seek God, do the research, and multiply churches wherever there is a need. Start a church. Multiply churches. A denomination that is solely responsible to identify and recruit church planters. Every church planter trains apprentices for future church plants. Satellite congregations that are dependent forever on the sending church. Satellite congregations graduate quickly to interdependence and become multiplying hubs. A movement that is held together by tight organizational systems of control. A movement held together by a common cause and relationships.

Besides, as we have seen in Ephesians 4, Jesus provided each church with APEST to ensure that they can stay true to their calling and can grow to maturity: “From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work” (Ephesians 4:16). Missiologists have called this self-reflective ability “self-theologizing,” and it provides a basis of the fourth principle for framing movement organization: God’s people need to think contextually and interpret the gospel into their own particular context. If they fail in being able to do this, they will fail to be a fully incarnated church—fully faithful to the gospel while at the same time being profoundly relevant to their culture. When others do all the thinking for them, then people will never learn to think (and act) for themselves, and they will remain immature and dependent. In movement thinking, each unit of the church has everything it needs to do its job, like the starfish. Outsourcing basic functions, ones intrinsic to the viability of the church to be church, are usually well intended but prove to be utterly disastrous in the long run. For instance, we believe that making a church dependent on external institutions to do its theologizing lies at the root of many of the organizational as well as the missional problems we face. The denominational seminary is a classic case in point. If one organization is set apart to handle all the ideas and leadership training, then the local church no longer believes it has to do the hard work of these itself. As a result, it becomes lazy and dependent on the external organization. If we are not careful, creating external training and licensing bodies can be a death knell to a movement and cultivate a propensity toward institutionalism. If you doubt this rather controversial statement, consider this: prominent sociologists Rodney Stark and Roger Finke, widely considered to be the premier sociologists of religion alive today, undertook a detailed study to track the remarkable growth and subsequent decline of the early Methodist movement. Within decades of arriving in the United States in the 1760s, Methodism could claim to be discipling over 30 percent of the population throughout the nation. All the elements of apostolic movement were evident in early Methodism; classes, small groups, apostolic organization, church planting, people movement, and so on. The so-called circuit riders were a key factor in this success.27 These profoundly apostolic laypeople were passionate disciples who, with some rudimentary training, rode from town to town, planting churches as they went. They would then circle back to ensure that the 240 the permanent revolution churches were growing and healthy. Stark and Finke discovered that around 1850, the stunning growth turned into trended decline. They discovered that during this period, the more institutionally inclined Episcopalians and Presbyterians had relentlessly mocked the Methodists as being uncouth and not knowing Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. Under this barrage of insults, the Methodist leadership decided that the circuit riders should do rigorous seminary training at least equal to that of their antagonists. The circuit riders were then required to do four years of seminary training as a prerequisite for licensing to the ministry. Methodism in America has never regained a positive growth pattern lost in that fateful decision.28 This is by no means the only example. An aspect worth considering is that the current training system was started and is still operated by the teacher and shepherd of the APEST typology. One has to wonder what a system designed by and for a fully fledged APEST ministry would look like.29 What would change? What would be the likely outcomes? To produce something fundamentally different is going to require a thorough audit and recalibration of prevailing practices. We should not be surprised, in constructing a theological training system (a tool) based squarely on variations of the Oxford-Cambridge model of theoretical academy-based learning, and subsequently requiring that all pastors should attend full time for at least three years to be ordained, that it should utterly change the most fundamental movemental algorithms that lie at the heart of biblical ecclesiology.30 We are not saying that education and learning are bad—far from it. But requiring a formal, classroom-based degree as a necessary basis for ordination, a concept itself completely alien to the New Testament, violates the calling and ministry that Jesus has clearly given to every disciple and lends itself to a professionalized elitism that Jesus himself detested. In addition, over the course of these programs, divinity students are socialized out of the context of leadership, ministry, and mission, anathema to movement dynamics because of the loss of needed momentum. This outsourcing of learning to institutions and professionals has a double impact: the impact on the so-called laity is that it discourages use of their own capacities to think and theologize for themselves. Serious theologizing (that is, reflecting on God), intrinsic to discipleship itself, is thus outsourced to professionals. It creates a needy dependence on the clergy, which produces intellectual apathy in the so-called laity. (Ironically, this is something the clergy complain about all the time.) Stated more bluntly, the system itself, the one they steward, perpetuate, and defend, nurtures the very thing that they bemoan. apostolic architecture 241 In all these reflections, we do well to remember the profound words of Roland Allen when he reflected on the apostolic movements—what he rather poetically called “the spontaneous expansion of the church”: The spontaneous expansion of the Church reduced to its element is a very simple thing. It asks for no elaborate organization, no large finances, no great numbers of paid missionaries. In its beginning it may be the work of one man, and that a man neither learned in the things of this world, nor rich in the wealth of this world.... The organization of a little church on the apostolic model is also extremely simple, and the most illiterate converts can use it, and the poorest are sufficiently wealthy to maintain it No one, then, who feels within himself the call of Christ to embark on such a path as this need say, I am too ignorant, I am too inexperienced, I have too little influence, or I have not sufficient resources. The first apostles of Christ were in the eyes of the world “unlearned and ignorant” men: it was not until the Church had endured a persecution and had grown largely in numbers that Christ called a learned man to be His apostle.31 On a more disturbing and personal note, and one that has serious implications for the whole Christian information system from publishing to seminaries, I (Alan) remember Chinese underground church researcher Curtis Sergeant once challenging me about this. In the West, he told me, we seek to become experts in order to “sell” our knowledge for mainly economic reasons—we thereby try to make ourselves indispensable—linchpins who intentionally create dependency. We do not give our knowledge away freely because that is our means of income and the source of our value proposition to churches and Christian organizations. In many ways, this is a legitimate form of income, but it becomes problematic precisely at the point where it impedes the capacity of Jesus’s ecclesia to grow and mature. Sergeant noted, and I believe rightly, that apostolic movements give knowledge away and would never think of attaching a dollar value to it. The original apostles were not consultants and did not seek to create dependencies based on their specialized knowledge. From an apostolic point of view, biblical truth belongs to the people of God, and we, if anything, are simply its stewards. This sounds a clear warning to all those (including the two of us) who consider ourselves educators, knowledge workers, consultants, and authors who try to make ourselves indispensable to the transfer of essential information. We must 242 the permanent revolution ask ourselves if we are creating unnatural dependencies or are empowering God’s people to live into their own truths. There are existing models of education and training that are more consistent with discipleship approaches and apostolic bias than the ones we now have. We must find a way to make them more the norm in leadership and spiritual formation. Placing theological reflection back in the local ecclesia itself is a good step in the right direction. And if we do not have models that suit, leadership should seek to produce them. We can, and must, design and innovate our way out of the current training morass if we are committed to being more movemental. A Balance in the Force Planting the gospel and thinking in terms of movements as opposed to planting churches are good ways of conceiving the processes, or foundations, involved in architecting movements. But the process needs to be bolstered by frameworks if they are to find expression. Frameworks imply structure, and indeed some form of structure and organization is needed. We suggest that one of the useful ways of structuring for movements is to develop what has been called sodalic, or sometimes apostolic, groupings or bands. Movements attempt to harness the energies of all their members, but they also discover ways to release the potential of their most committed workers for the benefit of the wider movement. The role of this more select group of people is to act as the pioneers of the movement going into previously unreached fields, as well as the consolidators who strengthen existing gains. Jesus mobilized the masses, but the driving heart of his movement consisted of the twelve apostles and the seventy-two disciples sent out by the Lord (Luke 10:1). Patrick intuitively understood this principle as did the later Catholic religious orders, the Moravians, the Methodists with their circuit riders, the Protestant missionary societies, and the Salvation Army.32 Ralph Winter has argued that God’s redemptive mission has been advanced by two complementary but distinct structures. He describes these redemptive structures as modalities and sodalities: “A modality is a structured fellowship in which there is no distinction of sex or age, while a sodality is a structured fellowship in which membership involves an adult second decision beyond modality membership and is limited by either age or sex or marital status” (Table 11.2).33 Most local churches fit into the modality definition. They are structured to be home grown, evangelistic, and discipling agencies. Commitment to Christ is the basic requirement for membership, and only the most serious of offenses result in expulsion. In the New Testament, most of the churches apostolic architecture 243 that received letters fit this description. In contrast, Paul’s missionary band (comprising up to thirty people, including Titus, Timothy, and Barnabas) could be described as a sodality or task-oriented mission structure. Inclusion was not automatic; a second adult decision was required to join the band. Not only commitment to Christ but continued commitment to the purpose and standards of the group was required of members. It is tempting to see Paul (as well as the other apostles) as doing it all alone, but clearly this is wrong. Like all the other ministries, apostles saw themselves as extensions of the ministry of Christ and his body, the ecclesia. Furthermore, they seldom, if ever, operated without others around them. Although Paul is often placed in the spotlight when it comes to the gospel spreading throughout the Mediterranean, a close reading of the text indicates that he did not work alone: he had anywhere from thirtyfive to ninety-five coworkers who, with different levels of regularity, were involved in his apostolic ministry.34 He most definitely had an organization with various levels of involvement and stakeholding. Whether you call them coworkers, fellow-soldiers, or just plain teammates, Paul had a mosaic of partnerships with people who aided him in his apostolic The church local The church in mission form Diocesan, parish form Task oriented, selective focus Structured primarily for nurture and care Mobile, flexible, lean Conserves new ground Breaks new ground, crosses barriers First decision peoplea Second decision peoplea Pastoral leaders Apostolic leaders Resources for sodalities Creates modalities and sodalities Occasionally multiples Inherently expansionistic Five-generation life cycle Extended generational life cycle Connectional ecclesiology Can be transdenominational Near-neighbor missionality Cross-culturally capable Builds and establishes Inherently entrepreneurial aAll believers make a decisive first choice to become followers. But only some are converted again to surrendering their lives to serve Jesus in a concentrated and intentional way. 244 the permanent revolution Outer ring Inner circle Trophimus The core ministry.35 From what we can discern, Paul’s apostolic band might look like that in Figure 11.3. The demanding, translocal, cross-cultural nature of Paul’s ministry necessitated a structure different from that of a local church. Paul’s ministry involved evangelism and gospel planting in a hostile environment spread out over a wide geographical area. It could be carried out only by a team of individuals called together for that specific purpose. It would not have been realistic to expect such work from every member of the church at Antioch. Paul did expect the local expression of the church to participate in his mission through prayer and financial support. But he called only a few individuals out of their local church to join his apostolic band who all added to the strength of a highly focused team to Paul’s missionary endeavors.36 Ralph Winter argued that the expansion of the church has always been carried on most effectively when these modalities and sodalities accepted each other’s legitimacy and worked together.37 The New Testament church existed in both forms—the translocal and the local—and each had elements of one in the other. Neither is inferior. When each accepts and receives the other’s role, the church is wired for movement (Figure 11.4). Reframing church structure around modality and sodality helps us understand one of the roles that the local church is to play in relation to apostolic architecture 245 apostolic ministry: to empower what is already taking shape in apostolic people. This implies a higher level of sensitivity and flexibility than is usually found in the local church. It takes a real commitment to the extension of Christianity for a local community to release its apostolic leaders to pursue their callings. In our experience, when the local community does not release them, they likely end up leaving anyway, but without the network or resources to best fulfill their calling. Church Resource Ministries’ Sam Metcalf, a keen advocate of Winter’s typology, gives a good summary in his lecture notes that shows the issue of commitment is a critical factor that distinguishes these two basic structures:38 Sodalities are primarily task oriented and focus around a shared sense of mission that is often narrowly defined (examples are most parachurch agencies like Navigators and Campus Crusade for Christ). Part of their function is to help modalities be healthy and to create new modalities (examples are Church Resource Ministries, Exponential, Future Travelers, Forge, Missio, 3DM, and other parachurch agencies created to support the church). Sodalities frequently multiply modalities as well as more sodalities, as church planting agencies do. They are apostolic structures in that they facilitate and extend the apostolic ministry. The life span and life cycle of a sodality are typically longer than those of a modality because the sodality can enforce discipline. 246 the permanent revolution People can be fired from a sodality for not doing their job. That is a standard that the church in its local form rarely attempts. Although sodalities can form within denominations in the Protestant movement, they are frequently transdenominational in reach and focus. The stimulus for ongoing renewal and spiritual vitality most commonly flows from sodalities into the modalities. In the urban church planting movement in Melbourne that I (Alan) used to lead, we took the modality-sodality dimension with great seriousness. So when we planted a church in our red-light district, we first set up a sodalic group, St. Kilda Gatehouse. Gatehouse performed all the functions of a sodality (missional functions, outreach, church planting, training) in the local area and in effect planted, and subsequently supported, the church plant called Matthew’s Party, which did the discipling, ran local services, conducted counseling, and so on. Matthew’s Party in turn supported Gatehouse in any way it could, such as financially and by releasing possible new leaders into the wider ministry. We did the same when planting congregations in the Jewish community of Melbourne: we set up Celebrate Messiah (led by my brother, Lawrence), an agency that has planted three congregations and has led international work among Jews in Israel and Russia. This proved to be an effective strategy, but the key is to be sure that the sense of mutuality and relationship is maintained in both structures, even if it means writing such a relationship into the constitution or by-laws. They must be deliberately designed for interdependence. Hugh Halter and Matt Smay also recommend and illustrate a similar approach in their book And, based on the experience of working for Missio, a training agency, and planting a local movement with many congregations (called Addulum).39 There have been, and continue to be, some remarkable sodalities in the history of the church: the monastic movement in the early period (Cistercian, Benedictine), the missional orders (Franciscans, Sisters of Charity), the Protestant missionary organizations (China Inland Missions, Overseas Missionary Fellowship), and the parachurches (Campus Crusade, Youth for Christ) are all classic examples of sodalities that have advanced the cause of Christ and brought renewal to the church. Some of the more notable examples of new sodalic missional orders in our day is associated with the so-called New Monasticism, a movement deliberately committed to taking the gospel to the poor. Examples include, among others, Rutba House Fellowship in North Carolina; Urban Neighbors of Hope in Melbourne and Bangkok; Innerchange in San Francisco, apostolic architecture 247 London, Cambodia, Romania, and Venezuela; and The Simple Way in Philadelphia. To Organize or Not to Organize? Putting aside the Christendom heritage and how that still biases our organizations, most denominational templates were formed following the model of the centralized management systems of the industrial era, models that are now rightly considered defunct by most corporations. We believe that it is well past time for us to return to our most primal and effective form: the apostolic movement. There can be no doubt that we are at our very best when we have little of the paraphernalia that we now consider vital to the church. The U.S. church spends over $70 billion every decade on plant and resources, and we are experiencing decline in adherence and membership at an unprecedented rate. This is unacceptable. Leadership needs to look beyond the expediencies of the status quo and make choices to design for advance and health. We do not think it is possible to improve on the blueprint that is written in the New Testament. In reembracing the permanent revolution, we will be well on our way to the recovery of a church inherently designed for advance. ‌conclusion it was design expert bruce mau who said that we typically do not pay any attention to design until something goes wrong. Design seemingly comes out from hiding at these moments, and we suddenly begin to pay attention to the deeper, often unseen world of design that so radically shapes, informs, influences, and directs our imagination and practice. We stand at a pivotal moment in history where the issues of design are calling out for us to pay attention and reimagine our vocation from within a context where Christianity is increasingly finding itself at the edge of the cultural landscape. It is from within this place of marginality that we are poised to rediscover and reactivate our most generative forms of ministry and leadership. And while the prophetic and evangelistic ministries invite a more thorough exploration, it is the apostles, and their distinctly missional vocation, who present themselves to us at this hour. They are, like the other four APEST ministries, a gift of grace to the church in all ages, and a particular grace for this time and place. As with all of God’s other gifts and graces, they beckon a response. To the degree that we allow ourselves to stand under the ascended Christ and allow his wisdom and authority to shape our imagination and practice, we will experience revolution. We are designed for continuous movement, and apostles are the permanent revolutionaries given to the church to catalyze the permanent revolution. If we can receive them yet again, we not only open ourselves up to a permanent revolution, we also open ourselves up more fully to the One who has given them to us. It is not too much to say that in the vocation and person of Jesus, apostles stand at the door and knock. If we let them in, we will, once again, God willing, experience the permanent revolution that we were intended to be in the first place. ‌afterword I can remember coming out of theological college in England in the early 1980s and moving into my first parish job where I was to be the local vicar. I had an endless number of ideas and aspirations of how this local expression of the body of Christ could, with God’s Spirit, push the kingdom forward. There were places of great darkness, and we would bring the light of Jesus. The kingdom would advance and heaven would be brought to earth. We would do things that were beyond out of the box, that were beyond the hallowed halls of the Sunday worship service. We would continue worshiping on Sunday, of course, but we would innovate vehicles of mission and discipleship to push forward the destiny of God’s sent people. Much to my surprise, this was met by a less-than-tepid response by my parishioners: “That’s not your job. Your job is to care for us [as a pastor would] and teach and preach from the Bible on Sunday and Wednesday nights [as a teacher would]. We give our tithe to pay missionaries in other countries [and your salary]. You’re the pastor. Don’t forget that.” Now I had not grown up in the church. At sixteen I picked up the Bible, read it cover to cover, and became a Christian. I was under the impression that what I had read in the Gospels and in the book of Acts was how the church actually functioned. It was a bit jarring to walk into the local church for the first time and see that it was only a shadow of what I’d read in scripture. As you can imagine, that’s always a tough pill to swallow and let’s just say the pill only went halfway down. I continued with the pastoral care and brought strong preaching from the Word, but on the side (and then slowly into church life) we brought these more entrepreneurial kingdom endeavors. Some of them worked, some of them didn’t. But asking me to stop trying new things to advance the kingdom was like asking a fish not to swim in the water: It’s how I was created. It’s how I function. I recognized the importance of pastoral care and teaching, and I certainly wasn’t suggesting the removal of them in our church. But intuitively I was 252 afterword asking for the addition and the proper place of the Apostolic voice. And at that time I didn’t even know that’s what I was asking for. All I knew was that I was called to lead this particular church, and I couldn’t help but start new things. So I continued in the local church, serving faithfully in the traditional senses, but constantly experimenting and responding to fresh vision and revelation from the Lord, pushing into places where there was no gospel presence. After several years of doing this, serving in the poorest place in all of Britain, a few years in the United States, and then back to the United Kingdom, something happened: All of that pioneering led to the creation of a spectacular missional vehicle that would not only transform our church into the largest church in England, but also spawned a missional movement in Europe and now onto the shores of American soil. Today, these midsized groups of twenty to fifty people on mission together are called Missional Communities and they have, in many places, started to change the way the Western church functions. Now this book you are holding is not about Missional Communities, and it is certainly not about my story. But it is about how my story doesn’t need to be a rare one or even the exception to the rule. The truth of the matter is that most apostles, after years of being misunderstood or cast out, simply give up, either by leaving the church or by slowly conforming to the more accepted and traditional roles of teacher/pastor. I struggled for years and years, never realizing there was another way of understanding my vocation, and when I finally understood how I was created, God used our church and my leadership for his purposes. But that only happened when I fully embraced my place as an apostle. My story can be the common story. This book is about the searching for that common story, about how the releasing of the apostolic genius in the local church will bring about other missional and discipling vehicles that will lead the body of Christ to its destiny. It’s about understanding the place of the apostle within the whole of the five-fold ministry gifts, how it functions uniquely within the church, and how it can be released to take the church into the future. To watch the kingdom unfold before us as the Spirit leads. Like the Paul or Columbo or Aidan or John Wesley before us, the Western church desperately needs to re-legitimize the apostolic voice. Not only understand it. Release it. Why the urgency? I come from a place where less than 1 percent of the population is in a church on any given Sunday. I look around in the states, in this place I now call home, and I see that Gen Y (the oldest of whom have already turned 30, had kids, bought homes) are only attending church on any given Sunday at a 4 percent clip. The Western church, yes, even afterword 253 the North American church, are staring over the precipice of complete irrelevance and stagnation and the apostolic voice needs to step up into its God-given place and be the catalyst of a new missional and discipling movement. I am not a “doom-and-gloom” futurist about the church in the West, but I am a realist. We need all five ministries from Ephesians 4 in their proper place, functioning together for this movement to happen. That means now is time for the restoration of the apostolic voice. For that to happen, what we must see is that every “vocation” develops its own scriptural templates, practices, and paradigms. But for quite some time the apostolic vocatio, long in exile, has lacked these basic necessities that have been so readily available to the shepherds and teachers. One of the signs of a particular vocation—churchwise or secular—is the acceptance and development of these tools, which confirms its own legitimate standing in relation to other vocations. I see this book as a significant step forward in that legitimization process. It develops a vocational language and practice, intertwining features and paradigms from other overlapping disciplines and thought constructs, and combines them to formulate a unique platform. It allows those in other vocations, like the shepherd for example, to look in on the apostolic and say “Ahh! That’s what the apostolic does! That’s what they are good at! That’s where they fit in the big picture!” It isn’t to say that the apostolic is more important. It’s to say that without it, the Body of Christ is incomplete as it serves a key function in leading the church toward its destiny in the same way that we are incomplete if we lack compassion for hurting and broken people. When I started in ministry more than thirty years ago, no such strain of thinking or book existed. I was looked at with dis-ease and a certain amount of paranoia. It was generally accepted that I was called to the local church, but no one quite knew what to do with me. My hope and prayer is that if you find yourself in a similar situation, if you have been created with that apostolic gifting and voice, that you will find hope and fresh vision within the pages of this book. If you are not, my prayer is that God will give you revelation as to why apostles are so necessary and how he might be intertwining your life and ministry with that of this specific ministry gift. The truth of the matter is that they are inexorably linked. Above all, know that this book is truly a gift, one that many before you hoped for long ago, and one that has finally been written. Mike Breen senior pastor of St. Thomas Church Sheffield, England ‌appendix a question of legitimacy: the restoration of the apostolic ministry You can no longer remain unconscious where you slept before; one way or another, you are creating your future. Wake up before you find that the devils within you have done the creating. Stephen L. Talbot It isn’t that they can’t see the solution. It’s that they can’t see the problem. G. K. Chesterton when she died on january 5, 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a wealthy widow of stature, left sixty coins to her church. This money was to be used toward the purchase of a few stones that would start the construction of a community bell tower. This building project was initiated by the local church leaders who decided they needed several new buildings in what they called the Field of Miracles. A year later, after digging a hole approximately five feet deep in soil composed of clay, sand, and shells, they laid the foundation and began what regrettably became a two-hundred-year building project beset by significant foundational issues. The tower began to lean just after the third story was completed and continued to lean incrementally, yet sporadically, toward the south over the next seven hundred years. Recent efforts to straighten the tower and keep it from falling over have varied from placing 960 tons of lead on the north side of the tower to removing earth beneath the north side of the foundation. In June 2001, the tower had been straightened up approximately 16 inches, returning its position to what it was in 1838, about 13 feet off center. Foundations for Authentic Ministry We think the Leaning Tower of Pisa is an appropriate metaphor for foundational aspects of the church’s function and ministry. Foundations are just as vital to organizations (including churches) as they are to all other 256 appendix buildings and structures. Shoddy work at the foundational level inevitably results in serious, and often disastrous, problems later. Attention to the underpinnings of the church’s ministry and biblical foundations therefore is imperative. And we believe that negligent inattentiveness to biblical foundations accounts for a number of the problems we face in being the church that Jesus intended us to be.1 We want to make clear that while we affirm the foundational ministries of Ephesians 2:20, we wholeheartedly acknowledge that Jesus is the one true foundation of the church and any attempt to build on any other foundation is rightly labeled heresy.2 There is a category difference between the Founder’s unique ministry and the subsequent work constructed on that foundation. The work of the foundational ministries (apostle and prophet) is not to replace the role of the Founder, but to build on and so extend his ministry. This is exactly how we should understand Paul’s passionate labors in Jesus’s cause and why he outright rejects any attempts by others to put him in Jesus’s place (1 Corinthians 1:11–24, 3:1–12; Colossians 1:24–25). The fact that we have all but eliminated the possibility of an active, ongoing apostolic function from our consciousness and vocabulary, let alone from our practices, indicates that we have somehow messed with the foundations of leadership and ministry, at least in the way the New Testament church itself experienced these. As we have seen, New Testament ministry clearly included the ministry of apostles and, beyond that, of APEST. The words apostle and its derivatives are used over ninety-five times in the New Testament, whereas now apostle has been all but edited out of our vocabulary. Whereas it is used only once to describe a function in the church, we use the word pastor as a catch-all title for just about every aspect of ministry. And while the biblical understanding of teacher is circumscribed in the Bible itself (James 2), we refer to theologians as the sole dependable source of authority. How can we account for such a massive discrepancy? While accepting the ongoing role of the shepherds and teachers, we have to ask how it is we can claim to have a truly biblical understanding of ministry devoid of the active presence and participation of those who occupy the overwhelmingly prominent place in the biblical material itself. This radical mismatch between New Testament APEST ministry and contemporary Western understandings serves only to highlight the issue that what we call ministry today is a substantively different from the original forms. Either this delimitation of ministry to shepherd and teacher functions is what God intended, or it is not. And if it is not what appendix 257 he intended, then we have made a terrible error along the way and must do all that we can to correct it. Retrofitting the Church for Movement If the role of apostolic ministry is as we have suggested in this book—the apostolic person is the legitimate custodian of the genetic coding of the church—then it is easy to see that apostolic ministry is of vital importance for the life, ministry, and health of the whole movement. And in fact we are unlikely to be able to fulfill our calling and mission as ecclesia without it. Surely to miss this is to make a serious mistake. We think that radical repentance is now needed to reestablish the church on its intended foundations. The truth is that much of the traditional interpretation, undergirding the prevailing ecclesiology that pastors and theologians have scripted over the centuries, has seldom, if ever, been subjected to critical review and challenge. In fact, in researching this book, we could not find much evidence of any real debate at all. The fact that we have disputed issues as trivial as to how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but have managed to avoid this issue for so many centuries, ought to make one seriously wonder about our sanity. The inherited position, undisputed as it is, is now assumed to be true; that is why one looks in vain for any significant exposition of the alternative in the standard commentaries and ecclesiologies that fill our shelves.3 Most suggestions that there is more to ministry than the standard forms meets with duration and rejection. This is a clear case of the so-called Semmelweis reflex—where the work of Ignaz Semmelweis, in discovering that mortality rates in patients with infections could be reduced tenfold if doctors would wash their hands with a chlorine solution, was rejected by his contemporaries. Here, the reflex-like denunciation of apostolic ministry and APEST is rejected because it contradicts entrenched norms. Author and politician Upton Sinclair once said, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!”4 There is something disturbingly insightful in this statement. The fact that most of the teaching determining apostolic legitimacy, or rather denying it, is generally produced by the very people who are most vested in the traditional arrangement should concern us. We are not exactly getting an unbiased picture here. Our academies are hardly intellectual centers for thinkers with distinctly apostolic leanings. Quite the 258 appendix contrary, seminaries are the very bastions of the shepherd-teacher type of ministry. And even if seminaries do not consciously intend it, their very purpose, their organizational bias, together with the self-selecting nature of the curriculum, tends to exclude the more generative (APE) types. Consider the content of the standard courses for a master of divinity degree. Comprising biblical studies, systematics, ethics, church history, pastoral studies, and perhaps spirituality, these hardly contribute to a study in apostolic ministry—or prophetic and evangelistic ministry, for that matter. Besides, even if one were inclined to question this, it would be naive in the extreme to think that spiritual temperament, ecclesial politics, and an inveterate tendency toward organizational equilibrium do not play a major factor in upholding the inherited interpretations on the issue. People dynamics are people dynamics, in the church and out of it. Whatever historical factors have conspired to get us to this point, at the very least our current mission-critical situation in the West necessitates a serious reevaluation of the foundations as well as restoration of the kind of ministry that can effectively meet those challenges. We believe that God has already provided for the church in the form of apostolic ministry. And while Parts Two through Four positively describe the various aspects of this remarkable form of ministry, the rest of this Appendix will show some of the reasons how, and perhaps why, we ended up delegitimizing the apostolic gift in the first place. From Movement to Monument: The Process of Institutionalization Paul could point to the foundational nature of apostolic ministry without the need for further explanation only because the role itself was patently self-evident in the Christian movement of his day. Although at times he had to argue for the validity of his own particular apostolic calling, he never had to make an argument for the concept of apostolic ministry itself; it was universally accepted as being a vital part of what it meant to be church. The very existence of Christianity throughout the Mediterranean was the direct result of apostolic ministry in the first place; it could not be denied.5 However, in spite of this clearly identifiable role in the founding and establishing of the early church, the apostolic function was increasingly marginalized as the movement grew and established itself over the next few centuries. We believe that the reasons for this shift are not theological but rather arose from changing social conditions. Contrary to what some would suggest, there are absolutely no textual grounds for appendix 259 the elimination of apostolic ministry from the church. There is nothing in the New Testament itself to suggest that the APE ministries would, or should, be abrogated once the canon of scripture and the institution of the church were fully formed. Whatever exegesis was used to justify this idea had to have imposed an extrinsic meaning on one or two selected texts (for example, Ephesians 2:20) and is a theologically anachronistic, politically motivated, procrustean reading to make the text suit the sensibilities of the later institution.6 We are saying that no case can be made from scripture itself; it came from elsewhere. The process involving the restrictive narrowing of the fivefold ministry (and the apostolic) can be better explained by reference to social realities that eventually confront every religious (and human for that matter) movement over time: namely, institutionalization itself along with the battle to define what is to be considered orthodox and conventional. Both of these key aspects are captured in what sociologists call the routinization of charisma—the process whereby the initial unique insight or experience (charism) of the founder is embedded or routinized into the very structures of the organization in the attempt to ensure that the organization itself survives the passing of its founder.7 The church followed the classic pattern that can be discerned in all organizations as they move from early stages to later development. And all this in turn is part of the broader process of institutionalization. While analyzing these sociological phenomena might seem somewhat abstract, and to the ears of pragmatic church leaders overly technical, it is no mere theory. This self-same process is going on in your organization as we speak and has been doing so since it started. We are wise to be alert to what is actually going on. Furthermore, grasping these will help us appreciate how spiritual and organization renewal takes place. Also, understanding these dynamics helps us to see how and why the more generative forms of ministry were marginalized from the movement and will continue to be so unless something intentional is done to guide the process in a more sustainable direction. From Routine to Routinization The New Testament church was undoubtedly what we would call an organic, grassroots people movement with direct concerns relating to issues of community, organization, discipleship, and leadership. And like all other human organizations, it was inevitable that they would seek to define social roles (elders and deacons, for example), proclaim what is valued and normative (ethics), create rites and liturgies, encode core 260 appendix beliefs, develop standards for discipleship, and build structures, all in the attempt to ensure the transmission of the message to generations that would follow. In so doing, they were developing various institutions and traditions that were intended to help preserve the faith beyond the first generation.8 But as New Testament scholar James D. G. Dunn notes, the result was creeping institutionalism, where ecclesia is increasingly identified with the external forms of the institution itself: Increasing institutionalism is the clearest mark of early Catholicism— when church becomes increasingly identified with institution, when authority becomes increasingly coterminous with office, when a basic distinction between clergy and laity becomes increasingly self-evident, when grace becomes increasingly narrowed to welldefined ritual acts ... such features were absent from first generation Christianity, though in [later] generations the picture was beginning to change.9 In these ways, the first movement sought to store and transmit the initiating energies of the movement and the charism of the Founder. But they did not realize that the very process itself is fraught with such tragic consequences. Ironically, it is Thomas O’Dea, a Catholic sociologist, who has best understood the nature of catalyzing encounters that kick-start movements that fade with the passing of time. In his seminal work, he notes, “Worship is the fundamental religious response [to such encounters] but in order to survive its charismatic moment worship must become stabilized in established forms and procedures.”10 But he goes on to show that this desire to capture the sacred creates an unavoidable paradox for religious movements because the ultimate and the sacred cannot be contained in institutional structures without those structures taking on a life of their own and, in the end, corrupting what they were intended to preserve in the first place. And so the tragic dilemma arises: without some form of institutionalization, remarkable religious experiences by themselves will not sustain long-term movement, but too much codification kills the movement as well.11 It is not hard to see how the apostolic ministry, with its strong association with founding impulses and, ironically, a participant in routinization, became one of the victims of the process itself. While institutionalization as described can to varying degrees be seen as a normal process in any group, it had some hazardous effects on the ecclesia that Jesus intended in the first place—to be both agent and appendix 261 expression of the kingdom of God. Like the Israelite attempt to store the manna in the desert, routinization of charisma is in the end an attempt to grasp the fading splendor of the God encounter and an effort to preserve it in priestly codes, ritual, and process. As such, institutionalization easily slips into institutionalism. And when it does, it inevitably creates problems because the institution will in the end tend to insert itself into the God relationship.12 Unchecked, institutionalization (along with routinization) easily regresses into a sinful endeavor to retain, control, and direct the initiating energy of the Christian movement. In a word, it becomes an attempt to domesticate and mediate God. But God, kingdom, Spirit, and gospel are much larger than any possible human codification can contain. While these create the church, they cannot be contained within or simply identified with the church. The church can simply be witness to these greater realities. To claim otherwise is to make the church an idol. Unregulated routinization also results in the institutionalization of grace that so characterizes the Christendom doctrine of the sacraments, where grace is captured in the sacrament, mediated only by ordained priests and restricted to the confines of the church’s internal organization. In these conditions, the church will tend to take on an authority and importance that it was never intended to have. This certainly proved true in later Catholic theology, where the church is viewed as the mediating institution between people and God and takes on a divine status.13 It is in this centuries-long process of encoding the initial charism into institution that somehow the dynamic energies of the apostolic ministry were apparently extracted from the apostolic persons themselves, routinized into the institution, and passed on ritually through the generations. From Vocation to Manuscript Another (sub)routine in the overall process of routinization is the encoding of key ideas and values into the writings that emerge from dynamic movements. Here too we can discern the supplanting of the apostolic vocation itself. As movements encounter the problem of how they might preserve and propagate their unique message, they begin to generate manuscripts. New writing and the new ideas associated with them are a sure sign that a movement is taking place. Witness, for instance, the burgeoning literature sparked by the missional movement over the past few years or the social media phenomenon in the broader culture. But the dilemma we face in 262 appendix the production of literature comes about because although we clearly need manuscripts, their production adds to the processes of institutionalization that become so problematic later. The reason is that the writings, especially when divorced from the original context and abstracted from the called person, will tend to displace the people who started the movement in the first place.14 In other words, grand, universal ideas, divorced from particular life and biography, easily degrade into mere ideology. And ideology in turn easily produces ideologues (partisan people who seek to impose ideas, or control others through ideas), who can become ruthless and controlling people; witness the Inquisition, Nazism, Islamic extremism, Christian fundamentalisms (to the left and right), or the Stalinist purges for good examples of the drive for ideological and institutional purity.15 Ideas are thus separated from the charisma and calling of the original generator of those ideas. Rather than pointing beyond themselves to greater realities, they become important in and of themselves, and eventually take on a life of their own. It would be like saying that in writing this book, we (the writers) become less important than the material we write. We thus depersonalize the ideas, so they easily become an “it,” an object for our manipulation. And here we have, albeit in embryonic form, the seed for the later concept of apostolic doctrine that, mediated through the religious institution and its doctrine, would eventually supplant the active role and presence of the apostolic person.16 The sad irony is that the production of official, defining manuscripts, combined with the other paraphernalia of institutionalization (apostolic succession, bureaucracy, and official cultus), comes at significant cost. From Apostolic Calling to Apostolic Succession Routinization also explains how we arrived at the idea of apostolic succession in the first place. This doctrine, held by some Christian denominations, asserts that properly ordained bishops were the chosen successors of the twelve apostles (particularly Peter) and that these bishops exist in direct continuity from the first-century bishops to the present day. Hence, like some ecclesiastical nobility, those ordained by the bishops inherit spiritual, ecclesiastical and sacramental grace, authority, power, and responsibility, and they pass it on to others. Thus is the line of succession secured from the first pope (understood to be Peter) to the current bishops and through them the clergy. Although all but the most catholic of Protestant churches rightly reject this doctrine as highly erroneous, it does explain the very mind-set that gave rise to, as well as maintains, the marginalization appendix 263 of the apostolic function. Apostolic succession was a direct way to try to supplant apostolic ministry, and in many ways it succeeded. From Pneumatocracy to Bureaucracy When we track the work of the Holy Spirit in the book of Acts from Pentecost onward, we see that in almost every instance, it is seen to be energizing, legitimizing, or catalyzing the outward-bound mission of the church. Here we see the disciples entrusted with the mission of Jesus moving beyond the narrow nationalistic confines of their temple theology and ethnocentric understandings of the gospel.17 And so the movement that flowed out from the epicenter of Jerusalem into global mission was inspired and empowered by the sending (apostolic) Spirit. This leads us to conclude that the early church is what we might call a pneumatocracy—a people under the empowerment, rule, and guidance of the Spirit of God. It is this uncontrollable pneumatic
