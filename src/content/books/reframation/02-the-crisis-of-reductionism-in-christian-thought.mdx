# The Crisis of Reductionism in Christian Thought

> "The gospel is … a truth widely held, but a truth greatly reduced. It is a truth that has been flattened, trivialized, and rendered inane."
> — Walter Brueggemann

## The Danger of Reductionism

Within contemporary Christian circles, a prevailing tendency exists to reduce God to manageable concepts or systems—diminishing the divine into tidy theological packages. Among conservative evangelicals, God is often constrained by systematic explanations that prioritize coherence over vibrancy, while many theological progressives interpret God’s action primarily as a function of human hands, effectively diminishing God’s agency.

This reductionism imprisons believers within their own interpretations, closing the door to the ever-greater reality of God. Such was the failure of Israel’s leaders in Jesus’ time: their interpretations became theological prisons for themselves and Israel collectively. In Jesus’ words, "they had access to the keys to the kingdom but ignored them, and blocked others from them as well" (Matthew 23:13; Luke 11:52).

When theology is reduced to propaganda, the truth becomes flattened. Analytical reductions, while necessary for understanding and communication, should never be mistaken for the whole. We must never lose sight of the enormity of truth—especially when speaking of God and the mystery of His involvement in our world.

## The Need for a Radical Reframing

Why focus so intently on these reductions? Because many struggles in mission—whether on the path, in culture, or beyond—stem from limited, diminished understandings of both God and the human condition. A reduced anthropology fails to recognize the existential and religious depths common to all humans: desire, longing, and the search for meaning.

As a result, Christians struggle to relate the dimensions of the good news to the universal human search evident in all cultures and throughout history. What is needed is a reconnecting of the dots—a reframing—so that God’s people might rediscover His ongoing work in restoring the world.

## "I Got Me a Piece of Elephant"

Recall the old parable of the blind men and the elephant. Each, touching only a part, gives an incomplete answer—each insists his own interpretation is the whole. This story is a common warning in world religions: we are tempted to box God into manageable shapes.

As Darrell Guder observes, quoting Karl Barth:

> "[The] human desire to exercise control would certainly be one of the major characteristics of all [fallen] religious systems.… ultimately expressions of 'the hidden desire of the human heart [...] to use God merely to serve [one’s] human purposes.'"

God cannot be put in a box. Moses asked God's name in Exodus 3:13-15 and was given a reply—YHWH—best translated as "I Will Be There as I Will Be There." God refuses to be conjured or categorized. God is always more, never less; always holding the element of surprise.

We are not claiming all religious perspectives are equally valid, or that God is thereby relativized. The God revealed in Scripture—through Jesus—is absolute. Rather, our own grasp can never be absolute. Historical reductions are never the whole; they are just "pieces of the elephant."

Church Fathers remind us: when dealing with God, there is always more. Idolatry, at its core, is our attempt to reduce and control God: worshiping the parts instead of the whole, substituting aspects of creation for the Creator. The prophets condemned this tendency as "the desire to have a god, to possess him… at their disposal."

### Consequences of Reductionism

The tendency to control and reduce manifests in several ways:

- Ossified doctrines: believed but not lived, faith degenerates into ideology.
- Wooden proclamations: little resonates; boredom dominates.
- Empty doxologies: ritual replaces true worship and relationship.
- Legalistic ethics: discipleship is reduced to moralism; shame and guilt replace freedom.

As Brad Brisco laments, reductions have led us to:

- Reduce the church to a place and gathering.
- Reduce mission to evangelism.
- Reduce worship to singing songs.
- Reduce the gospel to bullet points.
- Reduce Christology to the cross.
- Reduce discipleship to information transfer.
- Reduce ministry callings/functions to shepherd and teacher.
- Reduce spirituality to withdrawal.
- Reduce church planting to starting worship services.

Have we so reduced the truth that we cannot enter a culture seeking meaning? If so, can we accept our responsibility in this eclipse?

## Deadly Religion

Our propensity to confine God to doctrine has created a safe, controlled zone—a belief in "belief about God" rather than God Himself. Matthew Skinner's reading of Stephen’s martyrdom in Acts 7 suggests that religious leaders, clinging to tradition, lashed out in violence from a place of theological idolatry: they presumed to know how God works and resisted any challenge.

This idolatry worships the creation over the Creator, giving symbols more weight than their referents. Idolators—sure of the treasure—punish explorers, even violently.

Stephen’s speech echoes the prophets: "God’s dwelling encompasses all of heaven and earth." The temptation to turn the pursuit of God into self-assured arrogance is universal. The text isn’t just about "bad guys"—it’s about our own tendency to reject messengers and cling to what we know.

Skinner suggests the antidote isn’t irreligion, but the memory of the purpose of convictions: encounter with the Living God. The invitation is relationship, not mere rule-following. Reductionism makes following God less than relationship.

> When defending truth without love, we violate the purpose of truth: to make us like Jesus. If our convictions leave broken bodies in the wake, "then we are almost certainly doing something wrong."

Are we too defending reduced truths, a god-in-a-box, confusing a part for the whole? As C.S. Lewis warns:

> "My idea of God is not a divine idea. It has to be shattered time after time. He shatters it Himself. He is the great iconoclast.…"

Reductionism is easier than relationship. Have we built ossified, wooden, empty, legalistic religions that reduce God's reality? The God of the Scriptures—is not containable. In Scripture, God is Spirit and Fire—always more, never less (Hebrews 12:18, 29).

## Martin Luther's Panic Attacks

One reason for the eclipse of God among Protestants is our tuning to the theological and anthropological concerns of past eras, blind to the crises of our own. Ironically, this blindness partly arises from Martin Luther's own spiritual struggles—his *anfechtungen* or spiritual crises—amidst the symbols and culture of Christendom.

Luther’s breakthrough (through Romans 1:16-17) that righteousness is a gift transformed the culture of guilt-ridden Europe. But this powerful context-specific truth soon became the sole formulation of the gospel, turning "objective guilt before God" into the only issue the gospel was permitted to address. So the evangelical gospel became one-dimensional: the "Romans Road," "Four Spiritual Laws," and similar reductions ruled.

We do affirm humanity’s desperate need for forgiveness and reconciliation. Still, God’s good news is not exhausted by the forgiveness of personal sin. The incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus addresses much more than guilt.

If justification by faith is the only permitted entry point, evangelism begins by shaming people, instead of pointing to good news. This is not our role; it belongs to the Spirit (John 16:8–11).

Deb Hirsch recounts an exchange where Christians answered the question, "What should be the first thing that can be said about any human being?" with the claim that people are fallen sinners. The speaker challenged this, emphasizing that more fundamentally, all are made in God’s image—before the fall, there is a blessing.

Evangelical culture often starts with the problem of sin (Genesis 3), rather than the original blessing of creation (Genesis 1). If the gospel starts with the problem, seeking God becomes a negative, problem-solving journey. For those searching for meaning, reducing the good news to problem-solving and moralism is futile.

Humanity’s needs are much wider than guilt. A holistic gospel responds to all dimensions of our brokenness, not only sin.

## One Size Fits All: The Procrustean Bed

> "Procrustes," in Greek myth, "he who stretches," was infamous for his one-size-fits-all bed—making guests fit by force.

The "procrustean" approach in theology: a single idea, tool, or formula applied universally, regardless of fit. As Abraham Maslow writes: "If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

This approach is evident in church history, with theological systems designed to fit prior assumptions. Christendom often imposed violent conformity, outdoing even Procrustes in forcing reality to fit formulas.

There are now more than 25,000 denominations worldwide, each built on reductions of the greater reality of God and church. Nearly every denomination is, to some degree, a victim of Procrustes.

---

## A Way Past the Eclipse

Section three of this book will propose ways to reverse this eclipse and move beyond our procrustean ways. For now, we need to recognize this as a problem common to both Christians and non-Christians—a reduction of truth, story, and living.

These reductions obscure our capacity to see God’s transcendence and immanence in all things. We must adjust our perspective, for in an eclipse of God, it is not God who moves, but us who obscure His light.

# A Story Greatly Reduced

> "God made man, because he liked to hear a story."
> — African Proverb

> "Telling stories is as basic to human beings as eating. More so, in fact, for while food makes us live, stories are what make our lives worth living."
> — Richard Kearney

Brueggemann warns: when we reduce God and truth, the story we tell likewise suffers. The result is a lifeless, drained version of the story of Jesus—flattened, moralistic, and devoid of transformative power.

This reduction leaves us ill-prepared for the missional contexts in which we find ourselves.

## Tofu vs. Warheads

Don Everts likens the reduced Jesus to tofu: tasteless, bland, merely absorbing the flavor of what's around it. In contrast, the Jesus of the Gospels is like Warheads sour candy: jarring, powerful, and provocative—"I feel alive," or "I cannot handle the taste!"

As Tim Keller notes, Jesus’ message attracted the irreligious and offended the religious; our churches rarely provoke this dual response because we do not preach the same message. Reducing Jesus makes Him palatable but powerless, absorbing rather than transforming.

---

## Wired for Story

Why is story essential? Because we are formed by narrative—corporately, personally, existentially. Stories are how we make sense of ourselves, our world, and our role in it.

As Alasdair McIntyre writes in *After Virtue*:

> "I can answer the question, 'What am I to do?' only if I can answer the prior question, 'Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?'"

We live within stories. The Bible itself is a drama, not a code or a mere list of propositions. Jewish tradition balances *halakhah* (ethics, code) with *haggadah* (story, parable, history), interpreting each through the other.

When we forget our story, we lose our way—as Israel did repeatedly. The story grounds identity, meaning, and direction.

---

## Three Ways to Make Tofu

Our reductionism comes through three key practices:

1. **Demythologizing**: Shrinking the gospel by weeding out supernatural or "primitive" elements.
2. **Demystifying**: Removing mystery, wonder, and awe from our approach to God.
3. **Depoeticizing**: Narrowing language and imagination, reducing theology to religious formula.

These practices contributed to the "disenchantment of Western culture," collapsing the premodern openness to the divine into rationalistic, secularized forms.

---

### Demythologized

> "[Myth is] a story that has ‘supermeaning’—stories that contain the roots of defining themes with cultural, religious, or spiritual significance… narrative frames through which we understand our roles in the world."
> — James Menzies

Demythologization renders stories rational, scientific, and disenchanted—stripping them of resonance. Biblical stories, once vibrant and "magic," become dusty history or doctrine.

Humans are wired for mythic story—it reaches below reason, touching our deepest longings. When God’s story is reduced, people turn elsewhere for meaning—films, games, and culture seize the mythic territory left vacant by the church.

---

### Demystified

Great stories are always mysterious, charged with "magic" and enchantment. Modernity's drive to classify and control has demystified the world, replacing awe with skepticism.

The premodern world was alive with the experience of the divine; modernity often denies or ignores it. The Bible, written with this openness to mystery, is full of theophanies—encounters with the "Numinous," what Rudolf Otto describes as *mysterium tremendum et fascinans*—mystery, awe, and fascination, all at once.

This sense of the ineffable, foundational to the awe and love of God, is absent from much modern theology and preaching. Without it, we lose wonder and, with it, the possibility of true transformation.

---

### Depoeticized

Attempts to rationalize and systematize the gospel have squeezed out beauty, creativity, and artistry. David Lipscomb and others warned against imagination and poetic readings, urging literalism at the expense of narrative and metaphor.

The result: a powerful story is flattened into lists of propositions; the grandeur of creation, rescue, and restoration is reduced to lifeless "tofu."

---

# Conclusion

Reductions—in thought, story, and practice—have left the church and its message pale and ineffectual. Rediscovering the fullness of God's story, with mythic resonance, mystery, and poetic depth, is essential for authentic witness and transformational faith. As we move forward, we must resist the temptation to box God, settle for formulas, or rob the story of its power. The gospel is bigger than our categories, the Jesus story more startling than our systems, and God always more than we imagine.
