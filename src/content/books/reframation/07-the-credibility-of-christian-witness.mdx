# The Credibility of Christian Witness

J. V. Taylor, the British missiologist, once remarked:

> "How secondary, indeed how futile, are all the means of communication unless they are actually born out of the very truth they are meant to convey."

The authentic witness of a faithful believer enables others to be receptive to the Christian message and more open to the intellectual content of theology. The appeal of the theology being espoused is therefore inextricably linked to the credibility and integrity of the believer. This also explains why poor or false witness—or the apparent hypocrisy of believers—gives people and society grounds to dismiss the claims of Christ.

Importantly, this is not simply about individual witnesses reframing God and the gospel, but also the irreplaceable role of the faith community. Lesslie Newbigin, one of the preeminent missiologists of our time, was convinced that:

> "The primary reality of which we have to take account in seeking for a Christian impact on public life is the Christian congregation."

Newbigin pondered how it might be possible for the gospel to be taken seriously in the West, where Christ’s claims have been undermined by the false witness of historical Christendom. He concluded:

> "The only [believable] hermeneutic of the gospel is a congregation of men and women who believe it and live by it."

While Newbigin does not deny the importance of evangelistic campaigns, Bible distribution, Christian literature, and conferences, he maintains that these are secondary to the lived reality of a believing community. Their power is derived only from their rootedness in, and return to, the believing community.

Hugh Halter, a respected practitioner of incarnational mission, puts it succinctly:

> "The incarnational big-story gospel will require a place of discovery, where people will be able to see the truth before they hear about it. This place will not be a location but a community of people who are inclusive of everyone. These people will be making eternity attractive by how they live such selfless lives now, and will be modeling life in a New Kingdom in ways that will make it easy for other people to give it a try. People like this aren’t desperate to convert everyone; they are desperate to be like Jesus and to be where Jesus is."

# Adding Beauty to Holiness

Judaism has a name for the idea of making life and spirituality beautiful: *hiddur mitzvah*—with *hiddur* meaning "to make beautiful" and *mitzvah* meaning "commandment" or "good deed." This ancient teaching communicates that it is not enough simply to obey commandments; life must be lived in such a way that beautifies them, and in so doing, life itself is beautified.

According to the rabbis, every opportunity to obey God is also an opportunity to "adorn" or "beautify" God. To reframe God and the world in ways that make the gospel accessible and appealing, we need to adopt this ethos: adding beauty to holiness. 

To understand this call is to realize that life should not be reduced to obeying rules in order to fulfill a code of morality. Rather, it is an invitation to live a life that adorns the ways of God with mind-blowing beauty—not as a way to earn God's love, but in response to it.

This concept is likely what Paul and Peter mean when they encourage disciples to "adorn" the gospel (Titus 2:10; 1 Peter 2:12; 4:11): good works and holy lives, lived beautifully, glorify God and serve as credible witness. A person pleases God when they decorate their lives with good works, and the gospel itself becomes beautiful in the eyes of those who behold it.

Paul expresses a similar idea when he encourages the Ephesian believers to "live to the praise of his glorious grace" (Ephesians 1:6, 12, 14). Markus Barth, in his commentary on the epistle, says that God has lavished grace on his people so abundantly that they cannot help but praise his splendid grace. According to 1 Corinthians 10:31 and Romans 15:5–6, every action—eating, drinking, abstention—serves to praise God's glory.

> "By its singing, shouting, dancing, moaning, in the face of sin or misery, but equally under the mercies of God, God’s people are appointed to be a witness to God and a light among the nations, ‘my chosen people, the people whom I formed for myself that they might declare my praise.’"

## Living Beautifully: An Example

Fred Rogers—“Mister Rogers”—serves as a modern example of living beautifully. Host of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood for thirty-three years and an ordained Presbyterian minister, Rogers taught generations how to live a life that told a different story. In a prophetic commencement address at Dartmouth College in 2002, he urged:

> "Be true to the best within you. Not just true to yourself, but to the best within you. I’m talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things, without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate. Peace that rises triumphant over war. And justice that proves more powerful than greed."

He summed up the mission for a new millennium in four simple words: **"Make goodness attractive again."** A life embodied by goodness and beauty is deeply compelling to those searching for meaning and purpose.

# Two Responses to a Broken World

Consider two contrasting responses to a world in crisis:

- **Nero and the Burning of Rome (AD 64):** As a fire devastated much of Rome, Emperor Nero, detached and indifferent, "fiddled while Rome burned," building palaces on the ashes of tragedy and showing little compassion for the suffering.

- **Vedran Smailović, the Cellist of Sarajevo (1992):** During the Bosnian War, after twenty-two people were killed by a shell while waiting in line at a bakery, Smailović, principal cellist of the Sarajevo Opera, played his cello at the site every day for twenty-two days—one for each victim—protesting chaos and hatred by holding up beauty to counteract the ugliness.

In an ugly and broken world, the ideal still matters. Living beautifully in an otherwise reduced world is essential. Such acts remind us that something more, something higher and better, is possible.

Blaise Pascal once wrote that the challenge is not so much to persuade people of the truth of religious belief, but to make them **wish it were true** by offering a vision of reality that is rich and satisfying. Once this desire is stirred, the mind often finds its way to deeper understanding.

# Living a Questionable Life

Michael Frost encourages Christians to "live a questionable life." That is, followers of Jesus should live lives that arouse curiosity among unbelievers—lives that are surprising and invite others to ask "Why?" This often leads to conversations about the impact of the gospel.

An axiom of communication theory underpins this: when predictability is high, impact is low. Surprising, intriguing lives create room for deeper listening and engagement.

Throughout the Book of Acts, early Christians were surprising: sharing possessions, feeding the poor, supporting widows, embracing outcasts, honoring slaves, and empowering women. Their "questionable" lives made such an impact that even the Roman emperor Julian feared their influence.

Julian's concerns:

- These people feed those not of their faith.
- They tend the graves of outsiders.
- They forgive debts and persecutors.
- They practice hospitality indiscriminately.
- They treat slaves as family.

In contrast to predictable approaches—placards at sporting events, street evangelism that ignores personal stories, formulaic altar calls, tracts and flyers, or moralistic rants—the most powerful testimony is a life that makes others say, **"I'll have what they're having."**

# An Antidote for the Emptiness of Existence

This book explores the possibility that there is a larger story to live into. The emptiness many experience does not have to define existence. Living a questionable and surprising life can offer an invitation into another reality—a life filled with beauty and meaning.

Ursula K. Le Guin points to the importance of art in breaking through routine and reopening our perception:

> "The daily routine of most adults is so heavy and artificial that we are closed off to much of the world. I think one purpose of art is to get us out of those routines. When we hear music or poetry or stories, the world opens up again."

James K. A. Smith adds:

> "If you want to change how the world thinks, you first have to change how they imagine. That’s why, today, artists are our apologists."

The arts challenge our reductionistic mindsets, revealing that we are made for delight, play, and profound hope. The arts are evidence of what Smith calls "cracks in the secular"—mysteries at the heart of humanity that resist disenchantment.

## The Poet/Priest

Have we considered that those with the greatest influence in reframing the story of God are often not the "right" people in the "right" places? G. K. Chesterton wrote:

> "I don’t deny that there should be priests to remind men that they will one day die. I only say that at certain strange epochs it is necessary to have another kind of priests, called poets, actually to remind men that they are not dead yet."

Today, we live at such an epoch, in need of "other kinds of priests"—the artists, poets, writers, dancers, actors, musicians, directors, teachers, and storytellers. Bringing about God's beauty is not only for clergy or professionals; it is for all who enter the search for meaning and truth through artistic expression.

The arts do not convince people to believe in God; they are frames that invite contemplation and deeper questions. Eugene Peterson observes:

> "Artists make us insiders to the complexity and beauty of what we deal with every day but so often miss. They bring to our attention what is right before our eyes, within reach of our touch, help us hear sounds and combinations of sounds that our noise-deafened ears have never heard."

Art is inherently a powerful and surprising witness—like a banquet for the hungry, or possibility for the weary. The true artist seeks both to feel the world's pain and to unveil its beauty.

As Emily Dickinson said, ideas should "dazzle gradually." Christian artists, open to the Spirit, faithfully use their gifts to realize God's vision in the world. We are similarly called to live with openness, alert to encounters with God on His terms.

# Repairing the Universe

In a world fractured by reductionism, the calling to live artistically and beautifully offers a way forward. In Jewish spirituality, *tikkun olam* ("to repair the world/universe") signals the task of identifying what is broken and restoring it. The faithful Jew participates in this renewal through mitzvah—acts of goodness aligned with God's instruction.

For Christian disciples, this responsibility extends beyond personal welfare to encompass societal renewal—being agents of healing and restoration. Although "tikkun olam" is a Jewish phrase, Christians recognize echoes of Jesus’ mission in it. Scripture is replete with references to renewal and restoration (Ephesians 1:9–10; Matthew 19:28; Acts 3:19–21; Colossians 1:19–20).

Paul commissions believers:

> "For we are the product of His hand, heaven’s poetry etched on lives [poema], created in the Anointed, Jesus, to accomplish the good works God arranged long ago." (Ephesians 2:10, The Voice)

Repairing the world is a potent metaphor for articulating the mission of the church in light of Jesus. Through his ministry, Jesus repaired the breach between God and humanity, restored relationships, modeled love and service, and ultimately, through the cross and resurrection, atoned for and began the restoration of the world.

Christians, following in Christ's pattern, extend this mission through their lives and actions. In all this, Jesus blazes the trail for those who follow. Repairing, healing, and restoring the world in Jesus’ name is a powerful way to live a surprising and impactful life. It compels us to take ownership of the story we live and tell—a story that can either contribute to, or repair, the world’s brokenness.

> "There is no such thing as an unwritten life, only a badly written one."

Our lives will communicate either individualism and self-reliance, or restoration and redemption—ugliness or beauty. We choose our way.

## Theo-Drama: Playing Our Part

N. T. Wright uses the analogy of an unfinished Shakespearean play: imagine four of five acts are written, but the final, crucial act is missing. We are invited to participate and give life to the story as it unfolds, drawing on all that has come before to fulfill the author’s intention.

Wright sees believers living in this "fifth act" of the story of God: from creation, to brokenness, to promise and fulfillment in Christ. Early believers gave us a start; now, we join God’s mission to repair the world in the image of the final act.

As Walt Whitman wrote:

> "The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse."

# Section Four: A Re/Learning

Having explored the depths of reductionism (Section One), the nature of our limitations and longings (Section Two), and a re-enchanted understanding of the world (Section Three), we now offer two final chapters to reorient the reader: to see what God is doing in the world and join Him, providing practical next steps in the process of reframation.

Our formulaic understanding often means we fail to notice the details and nuances of those around us, missing opportunities to connect people with God in resonant ways. Our spiritual radar, attuned to the frequencies of bygone eras, must be reset to the contemporary realities we now face.

Over the next two chapters, we will explore:

- The adjustment of our spiritual "frequency" to current issues.
- Basic rhythms of life that make space for sacred encounters.
- Recognizing the image of God within every soul.

> The Lord is closer to us than we are to ourselves: higher than my highest and more inward than my innermost self.

## The Narrative of Buried Sacredness

In Willa Cather's *Death Comes for the Archbishop*, set in early twentieth-century New Mexico, Father Vaillant is shown sacred objects hidden by a Pima Indian convert’s ancestors. The faith, in that wild frontier, is like a buried treasure; it is guarded, but its true use is unknown until someone helps restore it.

For Father Vaillant, the missionary task is not to bring God to others, but to unearth the artifacts already buried within their souls—to help them use this knowledge to pursue restoration in the gospel. His vocation is to "restore to God his own."

## Missing the Key

Sometimes, the keys to a person’s soul are easy to overlook. Alan tells of his father, a man uninterested in spirituality, whose only book was *Chariots of the Gods*, a work positing alien intervention in history. In his last days, Alan's father fixated on the "rod and the staff" from Psalm 23, which Alan realized later was tied to his father’s alien theories—not a search for comfort, but a link to meaning.

After his father’s death, Alan saw that this obsession was a "key" to his father’s soul—one he had overlooked, missing an opportunity for deeper connection. This story illustrates our point: every person and culture offers keys to their soul, but we often miss them by clinging to a limited understanding.

As von Balthasar writes:

> "Man is the creature with a mystery in his heart that is bigger than himself. He is built like a tabernacle around a most sacred mystery... The room itself does not need to be built: it is already there and always has been, at the very center of man."

# Becoming a Detective of Divinity

As followers of Jesus, attuned to an enchanted universe, we should recognize the many ways God touches us outside traditionally "religious" settings. These encounters—through grief, athletic achievement, relationships, artistic expression—are God’s footprints, or prevenient grace.

Bruxy Cavey captures this mission:

> "God leaves a trail of breadcrumbs in nature, art, science, religion, and every individual life—all leading toward Jesus. Today, let’s be alert, stay curious, ask questions, and share the Gospel so we can partner with God and help people complete the journey."

Jesuits articulate this as "finding God in all things." Being a detective involves following clues—emotions, hungers, fears, loves—elements that unlock deeper realities.

## Show Me Your Idols…

Idols are the quick substitutes for God—anything to which we ascribe ultimate value in an attempt to satisfy our deepest longings. They are signposts to what a culture truly values and seeks. As Paul observed in Athens (Acts 17:16 NRSV), the city’s idols spoke volumes about its quest for meaning.

> "Show me your idols and I’ll show you who you are."

Tim Keller insists that approaching people through their idols provides a better key to their souls than justification by faith alone. Paul understood this in his engagement with the Athenians.

---

## Paul Found His Keys

Paul’s three-step approach in Athens offers a model:

1. **Immersion in Culture:**  
   "People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious..." (Acts 17:22)
   
   Paul studied their religions, attempting to understand the dynamics of their quests and the existential dilemmas they addressed.

2. **Philosophical Engagement:**  
   "A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some...asked, 'What is this babbler trying to say?'" (Acts 17:18)

   Paul was seen as a "scavenger of thoughts," engaging deeply with their philosophical inquiries and searching for meaning.

3. **Artistic Resonance:**  
   "As some of your own poets have said..." (Acts 17:28)

   Recognizing that all art seeks meaning and beauty, Paul quoted Greek poets, connecting their search with the gospel story.

To be effective missionaries in today’s world, we must:

- Decode dominant cultural narratives and understand their emotional imprints (as with Japan’s tea culture).
- Engage with artists, authors, filmmakers, and musicians who function as prophets and commentators for their generation.
- Explore the "why" behind the "what" of cultural practices, recognizing the existential issues at play.

> "All great art is religious, an act of homage before the glory of what exists." — Von Balthasar

---

## Not Simply "What" But "Why"

Missional anthropologists must learn not only what people and cultures do, but why. The story of instant coffee in Japan—where meaning was lacking, success was elusive—illustrates that without deep emotional and narrative resonance, transformation will not occur.

This aligns with Jesus, who rarely answered questions directly but spoke to the underlying heart issues—the existential "why" behind outward expressions.

---

# Follow the Traces

Inspired by Paul’s approach, mission-minded people should engage their neighborhoods, workplaces, and lives for traces of God:

**Suggestions for Detecting the Divine:**

- Begin with prayerful attention.  
  Ask: "Lord, what are you already doing in this context or person's life?"

- Look for dominant cultural metaphors.  
  (E.g., "digital natives" are comfortable with invisible realities.)

- Employ all your (spiritual) senses.  
  - What is the flavor or atmosphere of the place?
  - What do you see with eyes of faith?
  - What cries or joys do you hear?
  - What draws you in or repels you?

- Assess values and activities.  
  - Where do people spend time?
  - What do they value most?
  - Who are their heroes? ("Show me your heroes and I will show you who you are.")

- Listen to music; observe literature and media.  
  - What do people listen to and read?
  - What messages resonate?
  - What stories do they tell themselves to make meaning?

By attending to these clues, we better position ourselves to recognize the image of God in others and join God’s work in the world.
