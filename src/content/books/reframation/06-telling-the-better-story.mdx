> Tell all the Truth but tell it slant—  
> Success in Circuit lies  
> Too bright for our infirm Delight  
> The Truth’s superb surprise [...]  
> The Truth must dazzle gradually  
> Or every man be blind  
> —Emily Dickinson

Emily Dickinson’s appeal to tell the truth “slant,” and for it to “dazzle gradually,” is a reminder that truth often finds its way past preconceptions, prejudices, defenses, stereotypes, and an overemphasis on literal facts—all barriers to true receptivity. Notably, C.S. Lewis, the great Christian apologist, reached a point where he no longer wrote “straight theology.” Declining an invitation from Carl Henry to write for *Christianity Today*, Lewis explained:

> I wish your project heartily well, but can’t write you articles. My thought and talent (such as they are) now flow in different, though I trust not less Christian, channels, and I do not think I am at all likely to write more directly theological pieces [...] If I am now good for anything it is for catching the reader unawares—thro’ fiction and symbol. I have done what I could in the way of frontal attacks, but I now feel quite sure those days are over.

Lewis’s reason was clear: the times had changed, and new strategies were required.

# Telling the Better Story

Our desire in this work is to engage the same questions Lewis faced when writing the *Chronicles of Narnia*: How can we slip past the watchful dragons guarding the hearts of those around us in order to convey the story of God in a way that makes sense to pilgrims on the Camino, the Playa, and everywhere else? How can we bring about a “great reframation” so that God’s story can once more be communicated in its full power?

Today, the twenty-first-century church often lacks the method and language necessary for expressing God to the world’s pilgrims. We may possess desire, knowledge, and compassion, yet our efforts often feel powerless to communicate the true potency of God’s story. Where, then, might we turn?

As so often, the answer is Jesus.

## Jesus Told a Better Story

Jesus told a beautiful story—not “destitute of poetry and barren of imagination,” but one rich in both. He neither eclipsed, diluted, nor trivialized the truth, story, or life. Frederick Buechner, in *Telling the Truth: The Gospel as Tragedy, Comedy and Fairy Tale*, writes:

> When Jesus spoke, he spoke “not in the incendiary rhetoric of the revolutionary or the systematic abstractions of the theologian but in the language of images and metaphor, which is finally the only language you can use if you want not just to elucidate the hidden thing but to make it come alive.”
>
> What is the kingdom of God? He [Jesus] does not speak of a reorganization of society as a political possibility or of the doctrine of salvation as a doctrine. He speaks of what it is like to find a diamond ring that you thought you'd lost forever. He speaks of what it is like to win the Irish Sweepstakes. He suggests rather than spells out. He evokes rather than explains. He catches by surprise. He doesn’t let the homiletic seams show. He is sometimes cryptic, sometimes obscure, sometimes irreverent, always provocative. He tells stories. He speaks in parables.

In Mark’s gospel, Jesus explains to his disciples why he speaks in stories:

> “You’ve been given insight into God’s kingdom—you know how it works. But to those who can’t see it yet, everything comes in stories, creating readiness, nudging them toward receptive insight. [...] With many stories like these, he presented his message to them, fitting the stories to their experience and maturity. He was never without a story when he spoke. When he was alone with his disciples, he went over everything, sorting out the tangles, untying the knots.”  
> —Mark 4:11–12, 33–34 MSG

When Jesus spoke, tangles were sorted and knots untied; things unraveled and raveled again. In telling parables, Jesus unraveled a tradition and culture rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, not to abolish or overturn, but to fulfill, accomplish, and bring to fruition the restoration of the world.

Jesus offered a new perspective on God’s story:  
> “I am going to put it all together, pull it all together in a vast panorama”  
> —Matthew 5:18 MSG

Jesus reframed the story—and it changed everything.

## Telling a Subversive Story

A central part of our theological and missional task today is to participate in this reframing: to “tell this story as clearly as possible, and to allow it to subvert other ways of telling the story of the world.” We are called to tell a subversive story.

Philosopher Ivan Illich, asked how to change society, said,

> Neither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light into the future so that we can take the next step forward. If you want to change a society, then you have to tell an alternative story.

Jesus brought about a reframation by telling a subversive, alternative story—one richer than science, history, philosophy, anthropology, or morality. A story that not only happened once, but is happening still.

> “Like every truly great story, its truth may lie not so much in its historical or even philosophical veracity as in its effect on the soul of the reader.”

The true power of a story is seen in its effect upon the soul. Reframing the narrative is not about clever quips or theological gimmicks—it’s about communicating a soul-shaping paradigm to real people: the twenty-eight-year-old social studies teacher on the trail in Melide, Spain, or the forty-eight-year-old artist at Black Rock City—and everyone in between.

To do this, we need to alter how we articulate the sacred. We need new frames.

# Looking Through Re/Enchanted Frames

Throughout this book, we have argued that our culture has moved away from openness to the divine, toward a rationalistic, technique-driven approach. This has led to disenchantment and a crisis of interpretation, causing non-participatory and non-transformative encounters with God. Disenchantment is brought about by:

- **Demystifying**: Eliminating mystery, wonder, love, and awe from our approach to God.
- **Depoeticizing**: Narrowing our perceptive range and reducing theology to formula.
- **Demythologizing**: Shrinking revelation to fit anti-supernatural, atheistic presuppositions.

To recover what has been lost, we propose a re/enchantment in our language about faith in God—a process involving **remystifying**, **repoeticizing**, and **remythologizing** the story. This, with apologies to the sixteenth-century Reformers, results in a "Great Reframation."

## Remystify

The modern quest to name, categorize, and control God has stripped our faith conversations of mystery. The premodern world was open to enchantment, but faith today is rarely open to the mysteries of the divine. Many believe that if an encounter with God cannot be cataloged or systematized, it cannot be real.

How might we awaken a culture numbed to wonder and move people toward what Abraham Heschel calls "radical amazement"? Heschel writes:

> Radical amazement has a wider scope than any other human act; it refers to the whole of reality, not only to what we see, but to the very fact that we do see and to the very self that sees. We must strive to keep this radical amazement alive within us. Beyond all our scientific theories and explanations lies the profound experience of radical amazement.

A critical first step in remystification is the recovery of wonder. Dr. Mary Catherine Bateson observes:

> Wonder can take you into science. It can take you into art. Other human beings are amazing and beautiful. The natural world around us; the more we study it, the more fascinating and intricate and elegant it turns out to be. Which is my interpretation of the Book of Job incidentally.

The Book of Job features Job, who suffers unspeakable loss. His cries of "why?" are met not with answers, but with more questions from God, reminding Job of his "appropriate size" before the mysteries of creation.

> “Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.”  
> —Job 38:4–5, 18, 25–27, 39:1–3 NRSV

Job asked God 210 questions; God replied with 78 of His own. In the end, Job received no answers—only an invitation into the awe-inspiring mystery of God. Balthasar noted:

> Unless a person is acquainted with trembling awe that reaches down to the very ground of one’s being—what the Bible calls the ‘fear of God’—they are not yet ready for the contemplation of Jesus Christ.

True contemplation begins in astonishment. Anyone encountering Christ is "impelled either to worship him or to pick up stones with which to stone him. Evidently, the gospel does not foresee any other kind of response."

Let us learn to present a God none of us expect—one who takes our breath away, whether in awe, astonishment, or surprise. The good news, properly articulated, should leave us breathless, inviting us not to contentment, but to deeper questions and greater mystery.

Don Everts, in *Jesus with Dirty Feet*, recounts the story of a non-religious reader who, after reading about Jesus, whispered, “Did he, uh,... did he get in trouble?” This reader didn't encounter a bland, palatable Jesus, but one who was offensive, impressive, awe-inspiring—and dangerous.

Let us recover the wonder and astonishment at the truth of God and the gospel, so that we may communicate a remystified story to a world starved for awe.

## Repoeticize

It is a great tragedy that the articulation of the sacred is, at times proudly, "destitute of poetry and barren of imagination." We must plead for a recovery of language, a resurrection of imagination, and a reinvigoration of poetry.

Although most of the Bible is narrative and poetry, faith conversations today have largely excluded both—resulting in a stripped, unpoetic language that cannot capture the divine. Amos Wilder, in his seminal *Theopoetic: Theology and the Religious Imagination*, wrote:

> It is at the level of the imagination that the fateful issues of our new world-experience must first be mastered. It is here that culture and history are broken, and here that the church is polarized. Old words do not reach across the new gulfs, and it is only in vision and oracle that we can chart the unknown and new-name the creatures. Before the message there must be the vision, before the sermon the hymn, before the prose the poem.

Wilder called for a renewal of deep religious imagination. Walter Brueggemann echoes this:

> The poetry just keeps opening and opening, whereas the doctrinal practice of the church is always to close and close and close until you’re left with nothing that has transformative power. [...] If you want an experience of God that is healthier than that, you’re going to have to take time to sit with the biblical metaphors and poetic images, to relish them and allow them to become a part of your prayer life and to seep into your very vocabulary and your conceptual frame.

### Wakening the Mind

The modern, disenchanted worldview presumed that eliminating art, metaphor, and imagination would lead to pure truth. In reality, this has led to a theology devoid of poetry and imagination—truth reduced to technical process. Meaning is not to be found in more information, but in deeper, poetic perception.

Eugene Peterson observes:

> Poets don’t simply tell us about something; they force us “into the middle of it. Poetry grabs for the jugular. Far from being cosmetic language, it is intestinal. It is root language. Poetry doesn’t so much tell us something we never knew as bring into recognition what is latent, forgotten, overlooked, or suppressed.”

Repoeticizing, then, is about re-framing—not just disseminating information, but inviting participation in reality's mystery through poetic speech. The biblical prophets spoke with subversive, alternative stories expressed through poetic imagination.

Martin Luther King's “I Have a Dream” speech stands as a prime example of prophetic poetics—awakening yearning for justice, not by technical language, but by poetry.

C.S. Lewis advised interpreters of Scripture to let figurative language speak for itself:

> “Never take the metaphors literally. When the significance of the poetic images seems to conflict with any theological abstractions we might adhere to, trust the image every time. Abstract theology is not likely to be more adequate than the sensuous, organic, and personal images of Scripture—light and darkness, river and well, seed and harvest, master and servant, hen and chickens, father and child.”

The willingness to repoeticize opens us to a deeper, wider gospel.

## Remythologize

Remythologization reinserts a way of making sense in a senseless world. Myth, as used here and by C.S. Lewis, is not a falsehood or superstition, nor merely an engaging tale. Rather, myth wraps truth in narrative, conveying primal realities.

Lewis argued that myth “draws a reader out of himself or herself and into something greater.” Myths reach to the core of human consciousness, resonating because of their universal, fundamental truth.

### A Unifying Vision of Reality

A pivotal night on Addison’s Walk in 1931, Oxford, saw C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Hugo Dyson discuss the nature of myth. At that time, Lewis explained he found Christian language about sacrifice and propitiation “either silly or shocking.” Tolkien guided Lewis in seeing that:

> “The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened.”

Christianity, then, is not just one myth among many, but the fulfillment of all myth. It draws together fragments of truth, “shines light into the future so we can take the next step forward.” Alister McGrath notes:

> Myths awaken a longing for something that lies beyond our grasp. Myths expand our consciousness, allowing us to transcend ourselves. [...] Christianity tells a true story about humanity, which makes sense of all the stories that humanity tells about itself.

For Lewis, myth made possible the integration of reason and imagination. We, too, are invited to merge reason with imagination—a synthesis yielding an imaginative apologetics, eliminating reduced, trivial gospel telling.

# Life Is a Cabaret

If this emphasis on poetry and imagination feels foreign, listen to Paul’s encouragement to the Ephesians:

> “Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”  
> —Ephesians 5:18–20 NIV

Paul suggests not that we become characters in a Broadway musical, but that we cultivate a “hymnic” speech, drawn from the Psalms and New Testament hymns. By living “inside the metaphor of a spiritual song,” the Christian’s daily life becomes suffused with mystery and thankfulness.

Adrienne von Speyr puts it this way:

> If Paul expresses the wish that we might live in the fullness of the Spirit so that he rules in a living way our whole life [...] we must make a personal effort to converse with one another in the language of the Spirit [...] In this way both we ourselves as well as our interlocutors are placed in an atmosphere of God [...] psalms and hymns give their imprint to our everyday speech.

The language of psalms and hymns is theopoetic speech, laden with mystery, wonder, suffering, joy, desire, and longing. It opens us up to God's presence and gospel in fresh ways. As we repoeticize, remystify, and remythologize our speech about God, we rediscover the truth's transformative power.

# Re-digging the Wells

In Genesis 26, Isaac was forced to re-dig the wells his father, Abraham, had established—wells the Philistines had filled with earth. Only by clearing away the debris could Isaac’s people drink deeply of the life-giving water.

Today, the story of Jesus needs “re-digging.” Many church attempts to tell this story have become artless, cluttered by inferior craft, kitsch artistry, or trivial comparisons. We must, instead, tell a better story and tell the story better—one that surprises, gives hope, and evokes wonder.

Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical *Hamilton* is an example of “re-digging” a cultural story for new resonance. Miranda did not change Alexander Hamilton’s story; he put a new frame around it:

> “I’m just doing what everyone else that’s writing musicals is doing. I’m finding a musical vocabulary to tell this story. For me, hip hop seems to be the only way to tell Alexander Hamilton’s story because it’s a story about words and it’s a story about using words to save your life and destroy your life.”

Likewise, C.S. Lewis’ *Chronicles of Narnia* aimed to “rearrange reality”—to re-enchant a disenchanted world. Lewis, heeding Dickinson’s advice, told the truth “slant.” When illustrator Pauline Baynes, finally understood Aslan as Jesus, she was “dazzled gradually.” The effect was profound and transformative.

# I'll Have What She's Having  
*(The Parable of the In/credible Witness)*

> Every time you live an attribute of Jesus you create a metaphor through which you can share the gospel.  
> —Jeff Vanderstelt
>
> Jesus refuses to allow us to abstract our knowing from our living. The gospel is not information; it is a way of life.  
> —Stanley Hauerwas
>
> What we are teaches the child far more than what we say, so we must be what we want our children to become.  
> —Joseph Chilton Pearce

How, then, should we live? In contrast to living small lives of mediocrity, how might we embody a repoeticized, remythologized, and remystified gospel?

Consider Clarence Jordan. Born in 1912 in Georgia, Jordan saw things differently from a young age. He is known for his *Cotton Patch Bible* and for being a preacher/storyteller in the segregated South. But it was not his public preaching or scholarship that set him apart; it was his life.

Disturbed by racial injustice, Jordan purchased a 400-acre farm in 1942, founding the “Koinonia” community to live out the story of Jesus in tangible ways. He paid equal wages across racial lines, welcomed all to his table, and taught best agricultural practices to the poor. This subversive living led Jordan and his family to be excommunicated from their church and targeted by the Ku Klux Klan.

Despite persecution, Koinonia’s radical way of life inspired the founders of Habitat for Humanity. Linda Fuller, co-founder, wrote:

> “We had never met a man with such deep understanding of what it means to be a Christian nor anyone who was as much like Jesus as Clarence Jordan. [...] He believed the essence of Christianity was incarnation; a spoken word without it being acted upon was absolutely meaningless.”

# Becoming a Theological Person: Let Your Life Speak

This is more than a call for better theology or storytelling—it is a call to live as “living letters” (2 Corinthians 3:1–3). We seek a new demonstration of the way of Jesus—a living, visible theology.

To “know” God is less about intellectual mastery than about union and loving participation. True discipleship is incarnational: living what we proclaim. Søren Kierkegaard wisely said that all truth demands subjective change. If it is true, it must change us—or our lives will betray our lack of belief.

David Tracy says, “there is never an authentic disclosure of truth which is not also transformative.” Jesus, the Word made flesh, is our model; his life was the message. Discipleship means we, too, must become—by analogy—incarnations of Christ in the world.

von Balthasar wrote of the “theological person”—the one whose life bespeaks theology. The definition of a saint, it has been said, “is someone who makes it easier to believe in God.”

> “Every person, by living authentically, shall become a Torah, an instruction.”

Authentic disciples restore the vital balance between theory and practice.

---

# The Disciple as Ordinary Hero

Love is the final defense of the faith. Jesus himself insisted that the world would know his disciples “by [their] love” (John 13:34–35). It is not theological manuals, but the faithful, authentic, heroic disciples—people like Mother Teresa, and Clarence Jordan—who embody the beauty of God’s revelation in Christ.

The in/credible witness of such lives reframes others’ perceptions of God, church, and world. Their holiness and authenticity draw others to God and provoke fresh questions about Jesus.

*Is the story we are telling big enough, mysterious enough, poetic enough, and mythical enough to help us encounter God beyond the eclipse of smallness and reduction? Only then will we drink deeply of the story that changed the world at its beginning, and can still do so today.*
