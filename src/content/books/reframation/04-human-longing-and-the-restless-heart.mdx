# Human Longing and the Restless Heart

> "For Thou hast made us for Thyself and our hearts are restless until they rest in Thee."  
> — *St. Augustine, Confessions*

## Desire as the Core of Human Nature

In Western theology, St. Augustine stands out as the one who defined humanity as essentially motivated by desire (*eros*). Augustine teaches that what one loves—what one desires—determines to which city one belongs: the earthly or the heavenly. Passion, in its negative sense (lust and covetousness), is nothing more than disordered desire—a longing that fails to acknowledge God as the true subject of our hearts’ yearnings.

Augustine begins his *Confessions* with these timeless words:  
> "For Thou hast made us for Thyself and our hearts are restless until they rest in Thee."  
> (*Confessions*, Book I)

*Confessions* tells the story of Augustine’s own restless heart in search of fulfillment. Chronicling his first forty years—including his conversion—Augustine writes little about his beliefs, and focuses instead on his longings, desires, and passions. His confessions recount a life spent seeking satisfaction in the wrong places, finding no rest until his story intersected with God’s.

Augustine’s argument unfolds thus: human desire, unlike animal desire, is at its root insatiable. Humans hunger for the infinite—an eternity of life, love, and joy—which, whether recognized or not, can be nothing other than God. Assuming God exists, it follows that God is humanity’s true end, for the appetite of any living organism suggests its function. The stomach hungers for food because its function is to digest food. So too, spiritual hunger misdirected—for wealth, power, or physical pleasure—leaves the soul unsatisfied, because only God can fulfill deeper desires.

As discussed in chapter three, everyone worships something. When worship is misplaced (toward anything less than God—an idol), dissatisfaction and discontent result. Our real appetite is for God, for whom all lesser goals are merely unsatisfactory analogues and substitutes:
> "Those who set their hearts on finite goals are always discontented; they must always have more and more and more of what they desire, and failing this are frustrated and miserable."

James K. A. Smith suggests that humanity’s restlessness—even the boredom of secular tedium—signals a deeper truth:
> "There seems to be something here that we just can’t shake—that no amount of ‘rational’ atheism seems to be able to excise. Might its persistence be reason to think that there’s something to this?"

This restless condition, religious or secular, drives the ongoing and universal human search for truth. Insatiable desire, longing, and restlessness are present in every human being. All are familiar with the experience of intensely desiring something that would make life more complete, even if they cannot name it.

However, few evangelicals possess a spiritual vocabulary that incorporates this Augustinian understanding of insatiable longing. Many are suspicious or judgmental of seekers following their desires. If we are to faithfully witness to God and unlock human hearts, we must reckon with the dialectic of desire—which alone can open people to the wonders of God and the gospel.

Without such understanding, we cannot interpret much of what transpires on the Playa, the Camino, or in any workplace or neighborhood.

# Sehnsucht: The Longing for More

## The Experience of Sehnsucht and "Joy" in Lewis and McGrath

Alister E. McGrath, theologian influenced by C. S. Lewis, notes:

> "Like Augustine, C. S. Lewis was aware of deep human drives that point to a dimension of our existence beyond time and space, a deep and intense feeling of longing that no earthly object or experience can satisfy."  
> — *Alister E. McGrath*

In his autobiographical *Surprised by Joy*, Lewis names this experience "joy":  
> "An unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable than any other satisfaction [...] anyone who has experienced it will want it again."

This common human experience is broadly known as *sehnsucht*. Literally meaning "longing" or "yearning," *sehnsucht* is the unexpressed sense that something is not right, that much is broken and left unfinished, and that life is not as it was meant to be. It expresses a relentless urge—a deeply emotional state of missing something—an indefinite longing that may or may not be recognized.

In the social sciences, *sehnsucht* is defined as thoughts and feelings about life's incomplete or imperfect past, present, and future, coupled with a desire for ideal, alternative states. These thoughts are intense and recurring, accompanied by ambivalent emotion.

Lewis describes this vividly in his autobiography:

> "[...] There suddenly rose in me without warning, as if from a depth not of years but of centuries, the memory of that earlier morning at the Old House when my brother had brought his toy garden into the nursery. It is difficult to find words strong enough for the sensation which came over me; Milton’s ‘enormous bliss’ of Eden [...] comes somewhere near it. It was a sensation, of course, of desire; but desire for what? Not, certainly, for a biscuit tin filled with moss, nor even (though that came into it) for my own past [...] and before I knew what I desired, the desire itself was gone, the whole glimpse withdrawn, the world turned commonplace again, or only stirred by a longing for the longing that had just ceased. It had only taken a moment of time; and in a certain sense everything else that had ever happened to me was insignificant in comparison."  
> —*Surprised by Joy*

Lewis' experience is archetypal: a brief moment of insight, of being caught up in something beyond ordinary reality. It is perhaps best described as a soul-wound, a longing, the sense of an absence of something once present—a love for something lost. This longing is an experience of transcendence; we long for peace, justice, love, beauty, goodness—for God. These things, elusive as they are, point our desire beyond themselves.

Lewis writes:

> "There have been times when I think we do not desire heaven; but more often I find myself wondering whether, in our heart of hearts, we ever have desires for anything else. [...] It is the secret signature of each soul, the incommunicable and unappeasable want, the thing we desired before we met our wives or made our friends or chose our work and which we shall still desire on our deathbeds when the mind no longer knows a wife or friend or work. [...] All your life an unattainable ecstasy has hovered just beyond the grasp of your consciousness. The day is coming when you will wake to find, beyond all hope, that you have attained it, or else that it was within your reach and you have lost it forever."

Crucially, Lewis insists this joy is not mere pleasure or momentary happiness; it must have "the stab, the pang, the inconsolable longing."

Human desire—this bittersweet longing for ultimate satisfaction—cannot be fulfilled by finite objects or persons. Rather, desire points through them toward its ultimate fulfillment in God Himself:

> "That we are haunted by unquenchable longings points to a goal for that longing—in eternity if not in time."  
> — *C. S. Lewis*

At the end of all human longing, as poets and mystics suggest, is God as the true completion of *sehnsucht*.

Lewis writes:

> "We do not want merely to see beauty, though, God knows, even that is bounty enough. We want something else which can hardly be put into words—to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves, to bathe in it, to become part of it."

Elsewhere, he adds:

> "God is what is at the other end of our wounded desire, of our experience of transcendence. If transcendence is an experience of longing, God is the object of that longing. God … is the reason for our experience of it."

Solomon expresses a similar thought:

> "He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end."  
> — *Ecclesiastes 3:11*

God has placed within each of us a longing for the eternal. The fact that we grieve over the loss of loved ones reveals that we were not made merely to be finite; we are made for eternity.

## Sehnsucht in Poetry and Culture

All poets understand and write about *sehnsucht* in universal terms. D. H. Lawrence, in his poem "Terra Incognita," writes:

> There are vast realms of consciousness  
> still undreamed of  
> vast ranges of experience,  
> like the humming of unseen harps,  
> we know nothing of, within us.

*Sehnsucht*, this universal longing, this instinctive searching in every person, vibrates like the "humming of unseen harps within us." It may be disregarded, neglected, or suppressed, but can never be eliminated.

Thus we conclude that "Alex from London," on her pilgrimage, exemplifies "every person"—including those professing no faith. Alex’s awe, her desire for purpose, is not unique to her; our Creator has set eternity in the human heart.

As noted, all humans are culturally imprinted and act upon often-unconscious assumptions. The unbelief of many is rooted less in argument than in these latent cultural imprints—beliefs inherited, not critically chosen. Even professed unbelief cannot silence the humming. Whether acknowledged or not, every heart is in search of God; no amount of suffering or disappointment can eradicate the restlessness within.

# Echoes of a Voice

This divinely placed longing—the humming within the soul—generates much of our collective culture. If our missional proclamation is to open human hearts today, it must recover this dialectic of desire, as Lewis and Augustine did, and speak to the reality of restless hearts.

N. T. Wright, in *Simply Christian*, identifies four "echoes of a voice"—universal desires that lead us towards something beyond ourselves:

1. **A Longing for Justice**  
   A universal desire to set the broken world right.

2. **A Thirst for Spirituality**  
   The intuition that we are made for communion with something far greater than mere physical reality.

3. **A Hunger for Relationship**  
   The innate need to belong, to know and be known. We were intended for relationship.

4. **A Delight in Beauty**  
   All experience and yearn for beauty, which nourishes the spirit though it cannot fully satisfy earthly longing.
   > "Beauty is to the spirit what food is to the flesh. A glimpse of it in a young face, say, or an echo of it in a song fills an emptiness in you that nothing else under the sun can. Unlike food, however, it is something you never get your fill of. It leaves you always aching with longing not so much for more of the same as for whatever it is that makes it beautiful."

To these, we might add a **yearning for significance and meaning**. Humans are meaning-hungry creatures, withering for lack of hope or direction.

These echoes do not, by themselves, compel belief or point definitively to the Christian God, but can open honest minds to look beyond the meager offerings of consumer culture and flat materialism.

Wright observes that not all truth is available via observation and experiment. We see moral chaos, and yet still thirst for justice, spirituality, relationships, beauty, and significance. Such knowledge requires resources beyond science or engineering. The cause of these echoes must be something or someone not simply part of the universe, but transcendent.

> These are echoes of the voice of God.

To study human longing is to realize that the search is on—a quest for transcendence in a world where it has been "reduced to a rumour." For seekers like Alex on the Camino, this longing is more than a physical journey; it is a spiritual one, an opening of doors to new experiences and possibilities. To be fully human is to seek answers to the deepest questions of life and death. Failing to recognize these ultimate desires distorts our vision of reality and our communication of the gospel.

### Application for Missional Living

We are not telling the story of God to people who lack for nothing; we are addressing the longings that already underlie every human life. Living missionally means pointing seekers beyond the temporal to the transcendent.

## What About Alex?

I (Mark) last saw "Alex from London" on the day we reached Santiago de Compostela, the longed-for destination of the Camino. Virtually all Camino pilgrims attend the noon Pilgrim’s Mass at the cathedral—a majestic, serene, and, some would say, transcendent experience.

I entered early, inclined to reflect on the beauty and history of the place and to observe fellow pilgrims as they arrived. To my astonishment, as I walked down the center aisle, I found Alex, alone in a pew with her backpack beside her, quietly weeping.

I never learned exactly why, but it appeared to be related to the Mass being conducted in Italian—her grandmother’s native tongue—a significance she could not put into words. We spoke briefly. Then Alex said something that hinted at a spiritual awareness she had passionately denied a few days earlier. Though a small step, it seemed significant.

She said with longing, "You know, I live in a flat in London that is right next to a church. I mean, right next to the church. I share a wall with them."  
She gestured, touching the air as if feeling the wall.

Looking at me as if revealing something weighty, she continued:  
> "So, when I touch the wall like this, it’s kind of like I’m there—in church—with all those people who believe in God."

I tried not to cry myself.  
"‘What do you think that means?" I asked.  
"I’m not sure," she replied.  
"Me neither," I said. "But I think all of this—your pilgrimage, your deep questions about your life and what you want to change, your tears—it has to mean something."

Alex said nothing, but her face, reflecting hope, wonder, questioning, and restlessness, spoke of searching, longing, and desire. She turned and sat back down, eyes toward the altar.

# Thro’ Narrow Chinks in the Cavern: The Dungeoning of Human Perception

> "We behold something illustrious that cannot undergo an end—lofty, heavenly, infinite, older than heaven, older than primordial chaos."  
> — *Vespers Hymn on the Feast of the Transfiguration*

> "Unless the eye catch fire  
> The God will not be seen  
> Unless the ear catch fire  
> The God will not be heard  
> Unless the tongue catch fire  
> The God will not be named  
> Unless the heart catch fire  
> The God will not be loved  
> Unless the mind catch fire  
> The God will not be known"  
> — *William Blake*

> "There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry, Mine!"  
> — *Abraham Kuyper*

William Blake dedicated his art to awakening people to their own divine nature. Through poetry and visionary images, he tried to break through dull familiarity to stimulate response and imagination. In his epic *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*—exploring the spiritual interconnectedness of all things—he writes:

> "If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro’ narrow chinks of his cavern."

This passage is key to understanding the central themes explored here. Becoming aware of spiritual blindness in ourselves and society is the first step toward reframing reality. Humans are attuned for eternity—the "humming of unseen harps"—but our perception must be cleansed if we are to discern and respond to it.

Blake’s imagery—"doors of perception," "cleansed," "closed," "narrow chinks," and "cavern"—pictures us as prisoners, pressed into the back of a cave, seeing the world only through a diminishing slit of light, perceiving reality as filtered, overwhelming, and threatening. Though the cave might feel safe, the darkness within limits our perception and participation in true reality.

C. S. Lewis, in parable, describes a woman in a dungeon with her son. She draws pictures of the outside world for him, which he cannot truly understand. When told that the real world is not made of "pencil lines," the boy’s whole notion of the outside turns to a blank. He cannot imagine what reality is without those lines.

> The prison's points of reference fail to help him perceive reality outside his limited world.

Blake thus speaks to perceptions, not objective reality. The actual results of living in such a reduced world are tangible, but the deeper root is our narrowed theory of knowledge—how we perceive, interpret, and make sense of existence. It is not just truth that has been reduced; our very capacity to receive and perceive truth is confined.

# A System of Hideouts

Apart from sheltering prehistoric cavemen and a few monks, caves are not places to live, but to hide. Scripturally, caves symbolize concealment and avoidance—a place where "the Adam in all of us" hides from God. Preferring darkness to the exposure of divine light, Adam hides to escape responsibility.

The Rabbinic tradition places more weight on Adam’s hiding than his disobedience. Human avoidance of God leads to rebellion and irresponsibility. With every new hideout, the situation grows more questionable. To hide, the rebel creates an illusion of safety, filling their world with the figments of fantasy. This fantasy leads to a life void of meaning, to diluted being, and to ultimately fractured identity.

Sin is essentially untruth—a lie that generates ideologies (religious or not) attempting to fill the gaps left by Truth’s absence. These beliefs become central, turning into our "primary truths." All people deny inconvenient truths that challenge settled beliefs—atheists and Christians alike.

Sir Anthony Hopkins, a former atheist, likened atheism to "living in a locked cell with no windows"—a cave again. In compassion, God continually asks, "Where are you?"—a summons to responsibility, to leave our hideouts. Answering begins to crumble the walls of callousness; God draws near to the honest and repentant, always revealing Himself.

# The Disenchanted Paradigm

The New Testament term for mind (*nous*, *dianoia*) refers to a mode or mind-set—a particular way of seeing. This is similar to the idea of cultural imprint, but mind-set runs deeper, forming the very consciousness of a person. For example, in Ephesians 2:3, Paul speaks of the "cravings of the flesh" as a form of darkened perception, while in Romans 12:2, he urges the "renewing of the nous."

Mind-set approximates our worldview or paradigm: a framework for perceiving the world. Every paradigm, however, brings "paradigm-blindness." Choosing one view automatically rules out others, allowing us only to see or be blinded to what is truly before us.

The terrifying aspect of living in a cave is this cave-rationality—a mind-set adjusted to the reduced reality of the hideout, which passes for normal. Inhabitants rarely notice, having inherited a way of seeing, and use it to evade existential accountability.

Lewis’s image of hell in *The Great Divorce*—named in response to Blake’s poem—reminds us that the true problem is rooted in human consciousness:

> "Hell is a state of mind... every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind—is, in the end, Hell."  
> — *C. S. Lewis*

This "darkening of the nous" is disenchantment—a refusal to see and acknowledge the living God. Disenchantment is more dangerous than revolt; it silences the inner voice that keeps the heart lively, extinguishing the imagination and wonder of the child.

Jesus taught that only the eyes of a child, open to wonder and imagination, can truly comprehend God. Disenchantment is thus as dense as hell itself: the wise become fools (Romans 1:22). The solution is a cleansed nous—a renewed paradigm, restored in relationship with God.

According to Paul, the gospel addresses disenchantment by:

- Restoring a right relationship with God (Romans 3–4)
- Reconstituting humanity around Christ (Romans 5)
- Reorienting lives (Romans 6)
- Bestowing His Spirit (Romans 8)
- Granting a new mind-set (Romans 12)

Through Christ, God offers a comprehensive vision of reality—far beyond the confines of the cave.

# Seeing is Believing and Believing is Seeing

> "To see what is in front of one’s nose requires a constant struggle."  
> — *George Orwell*

A well-known story describes how, upon Columbus’s arrival in the Caribbean, the indigenous people could not "see" his ships on the horizon—these were beyond their conceptual experience, and therefore beyond possibility.

This illustrates that limited perceptual categories mean people often do not "see" what is before them. We tend to perceive only what fits our established frames of reference, rejecting what cannot be easily incorporated. This is "seeing what we believe is possible."

As N. T. Wright notes in *Simply Good News*, Jesus encountered the same problem: many could not see or receive his message, as it did not match their expectations or mental categories.

> "How we understand things is a function of our whole personality. But if that personality is flawed, this will affect our mental framework. [...] If we insist on keeping our mental, emotional, and imaginative world the way it’s always been, the good news just won’t fit."

Jesus, like no other, challenged his hearers to see differently—to face new and dangerous questions, to look at familiar ideas from unexpected angles. Most find such change disturbing.

We are long-term inmates of our respective dungeon-hideouts, seeing not reality, but delusions about the human condition. Scientific "facts," for all their value, are abstractions—missing each thing’s uniqueness. A veil of thinking lies between us and reality. Illumination involves removing this veil and experiencing what simply is.

---

# Removing the Veil

Scripture employs the metaphor of unveiling to describe the coming of truth and revelation. The New Testament word for truth (*aletheia*) means "unveiling" or "disclosedness."

- **2 Corinthians 3:15–16 (NRSV):**  
  "To this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds; but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed."
- **Ezekiel 37:**  
  God unveils Ezekiel’s eyes to see Israel’s future.
- **Genesis 28:**  
  Jacob, at Bethel, dreams of a ladder and encounters God personally. The revelation is not merely a vision, but the realization that
  > "Surely the Lord is in this place—and I did not know it!" (Genesis 28:16 NRSV)

Like many before and after him, Jacob’s perception is cleansed; he sees reality as it has always been, yet had remained unnoticed. This unveiling reorients, expands, and transforms life.

In *The Truman Show*, Jim Carrey’s character slowly realizes his world is "plastic," not ultimate reality. His growing dissatisfaction signals the existence of a larger, truer world. Once aware, each person must decide: remain in the counterfeit, or seek the truth, even if it disrupts comfort?

If we are locked into certain patterns of perception, talk about unveiling and expanding our world can seem threatening. Yet to grow in our experience of God, we must cleanse our "doors of perception" and open ourselves to greater reality.

---

# "All I Know Is All There Is"

William James, in *The Varieties of Religious Experience*, laments the human tendency toward a "fixed mind-set"—clinging to static ideas long after they have outlived their truth or relevance. Selfishness, rebellion, and a refusal to pursue God cloud perception; each generation perpetuates this narrative, often unconsciously.

This kind of unbelief is self-generating; it excludes God from consideration. Most people, open to new concepts in youth, grow fixed in their views soon after. As James observes, "intellectual senility" sets in well before physical infirmity.

Rather than believing "all I know is all there is," we must learn to see that our knowledge is limited, and reality is more expansive than we imagine. Otherwise, we risk missing the very truth that can set us free.

For example, a disenchanted view of beauty divorces it from context and transcendence; it snares the viewer in idolatry, unable to point beyond itself to splendor and glory. Our cave-dwelling existence offers a false reality—chains largely of our own making.

> "We need no urging to choose what it is that will destroy us because, again and again, we choose it without urging. We are more than half in love with our own destruction. All of us are."  
> — *W. H. Auden*

To avoid intellectual imprisonment, we must keep questioning:
- What does it mean to exist?
- How does one come to know Truth?
- Can God truly draw near in Christ?
- How then should we live?

No formulas or propositions suffice; the answer is found in relationship with God.

> Authentic Christian faith, real discipleship, must always be characterized by a "transformation of the individual under the impact of revelation."  
> — *Murray Rae*

---

# Metanoia: The Cleansing of Perception

Owen Barfield, of the Inklings, reminds us:

> "The first step of all is to realize that mental habit is a prison. [...] What matters is our coming to realize that the way we habitually think and perceive is not the only possible way, not even a way that has been going on very long. It is the way we have come to think, the way we have come to perceive."

Scripture is clear: real transformation begins with the call to metanoia—repentance, a radical turning and renewal of mind and heart. Jesus begins his ministry with this call:

> "The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!"  
> — *Mark 1:14–15*

Repentance is addressed, first, to the people of God—the religious insiders, who most need perception cleansed and hearts transformed.

We must let go of narrow frameworks and receive anew, by grace, the world as it truly is. Despite postmodern celebration of "openness," real change is always challenging.

## The Role of Repentance

Repentance is:
- Standing on the desk to see the world differently.
- Refused by residents of "Grey Town" (in Lewis's metaphor); they make hell for themselves by closing off to metanoia.
- The key to Harold Crick’s transformation.
- The right response to any reductionism or idolatry.
- How we renew and reenchant our darkened *nous*.
- A prerequisite to the art of seeing again.

Communicating the bigger picture of God—with theology, story, and life—draws people to repentance, as beauty lures us away from lesser loves toward God, the infinitely lovely.

> "God replaces our desire for worldly things by luring us away from them by showing us Himself, which is infinitely more lovely, valuable, and sweeter than all our other lusts and desires."  
> — *Romans 2:4 paraphrased*

No spiritual progress is possible without humility—the confession that "all I know is not all there is." True change is not merely intellectual but the conversion of the heart.

## The Work of the Spirit

Repentance and transformation come only as the Holy Spirit opens our hearts and minds:
> "When he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth."  
> — *John 16:13*

The Spirit illumines us, sensitizes us to Christ, helps us understand and appropriate truth, and leads us out of the dungeon.

As Paul affirms:

> "What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived—the things God has prepared for those who love him—these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. [...] The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit."  
> — *1 Corinthians 2:9–16*

To overcome the problems of limiting perception and illusion, we must learn to pray—for ourselves and for those around us...
