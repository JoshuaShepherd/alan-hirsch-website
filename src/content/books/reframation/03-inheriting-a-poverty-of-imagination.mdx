# Inheriting a Poverty of Imagination

Tolbert Fanning's legacy, it seems, included a negative assessment of imagination—a perspective later inherited by Lipscomb. In Fanning's eulogy, H. R. Moore wrote:

> “He waved no plumes, wreathed no garlands, but struck from the shoulder and at the vitals. He was destitute of poetry and barren of imagination.”<sup>38</sup>

Eulogies are meant to represent the highest praise for someone—a summary of their life's achievements. Yet, what kind of logic considers the words “destitute of poetry and barren of imagination” as high praise? Read that tragic line again: *He was destitute of poetry and barren of imagination.* Such a sorrowful lament.

## Is This Poverty Still Prevalent?

Is this poverty of imagination and poetry still prevalent in our circles? We believe it is. From our experience, most classical evangelical education fails to pass on any appreciation of poetry or a hermeneutic that understands how revelation impacts the godly imagination. Students are often instructed in what to believe and trained in analytical, rationalistic approaches to theology and exegesis. This leaves a huge deficiency in our capacity to enter into relationship both with God and His story.

As Robert Frost reportedly noted:

> “Poetry is what gets lost in translation.”<sup>39</sup>

But what a loss this is! Consider that much of the Bible is written in poetic form—prophecies with fertile symbolism and rhetorical rhythm; apocalyptic texts with a multitude of images and metaphors; the Psalms with their lyrical cadence of joy and lament. Symbols, metaphors, and other verbal devices—the very stuff of poetry—are woven throughout Scripture. If we fail to interpret these as intended, we cannot grasp what is being communicated. Poetry cannot and must not be read as rational, systematic code.

John Piper writes:

> “The imagination calls up new words, new images, new analogies, new metaphors, new illustrations, new connections to say old, glorious truth—whether from the world or from the Word of God. Imagination is the faculty of the mind that God has given us to make the communication of His beauty beautiful.”

To communicate breathtaking truth in a boring way is “probably a sin,” Piper says, because God is “infinitely worthy of ever-new verbal, musical, and visual expressions.”<sup>40</sup>

Because Scripture's appeal is to the imagination, the story of Jesus is not meant to be read without an understanding of metaphor and other literary forms. All the prophets were poets—try reading them literally and see where it gets you. They pile metaphor upon metaphor. Metaphors are remarkable tools: they mean both what they say and what they do not say. One does not “figure out” a metaphor; rather, one enters into what is being communicated.<sup>41</sup>

For instance, when Jesus is called “the Lamb of God,” He is not a literal lamb. When Peter calls Jesus a “living Stone,” it does not mean His chemical makeup had changed to rock. These are creative forms of speech, designed to communicate richer, more meaningful understandings of Jesus’ person and work, and to invite a response.

All language forms—narrative, poetry, prose, etc.—become destitute and barren when read one-dimensionally; in fact, it can be dangerous to do so. How can we come to grips with God’s story if we fail to engage poetry and prose on their own terms? Consider the consequences: draining the Gospels of their narrative power leads to misinterpretation. People “destitute of poetry and barren of imagination” cannot grasp what Jesus truly meant—whether in His metaphors about the “yeast of the Pharisees” (Matthew 16), references to places where others “could not go” (John 14), the eating of His body and drinking of His blood (John 6), or the meaning of being “born again” (John 3). The inability to think poetically and metaphorically results in profound misunderstanding.

Often, people cannot grasp Jesus because He speaks poetically—evoking imagination—and literalistic interpretations reduce His words to doctrinal templates devoid of imagination.<sup>42</sup> Failing to engage God and the Bible poetically and imaginatively will almost guarantee we misread both, for we are forcing sacred experiences into flat, informational categories.

It’s like interpreting a multi-dimensional reality with a one-dimensional method—it flattens revelation. When we force univocal literalism onto a multivocal text, the Bible becomes an echo of our own mentality: everything is cut and dried, predictable rather than surprising, religious rather than spiritual, benign rather than liminal. The Word is entrapped in literalist hermeneutics; the resonance and voluptuousness of Truth are gone.

This “depoeticized” (“destitute and barren”) perspective of theology, God, and the story of Jesus contributes to a story reduced to “a curd made from mashed soybeans.” Tragically, we have all become effectively blinded to this great reduction.

# The Red Terror

> We cannot allow the story to be reduced. We cannot allow it to be demythologized, demystified, or depoeticized.

We must resist reductionist tendencies and instead recognize the power of story in our lives—especially in the proclamation of the gospel.

The October Revolution refers to a socialist revolt in Russia in 1917. Led by Vladimir Lenin, the Bolsheviks overthrew an autocratic government, seizing control of both rural and urban domains. To suppress dissension, the Cheka—Bolshevik secret police—were tasked with quashing all rebellion, leading to thousands of Russians being arrested, detained, tortured, or executed over three to four years in what became known as “The Red Terror.”

One story from this era tells of a lone horseman entering a small rural village in the Ural Mountains. He asked to meet the leaders:

> “Do you have many storytellers here in your village?”

Of course they did—the narratives of history and culture had always been passed down through stories. Men gathered to hear accomplished storytellers recount tales of village heroes and past deeds. Children gathered in the square, weaving magical tales into the fabric of young lives.

The visitor announced:

> “I would like to recognize and give honor to your storytellers and to all storytellers from villages throughout this region. My comrades and I wish to celebrate with a festival just for them.”

The village was thrilled. On the day of the festival, the town hall filled with storytellers from miles around, awaiting celebration. The organizer arrived, addressed the crowd and asked them to wait a few more moments. Suddenly, the sound of horses filled the courtyard, and torches set the building ablaze. Doors had been sealed. The storytellers for miles around perished as the hall burnt to the ground.<sup>43</sup>

Similar events happened across Russia. The Bolsheviks understood a deep truth: *remove a people’s story, and they no longer know who they are*. Without story, there is no sense of values, origins, or destiny. Remove their story and you can substitute anything in its place.

We need an unreduced and unleashed story to make sense of God, our lives, and the world. The influence of story on identity, behavior, and calling cannot be underestimated. Our inability to invite people into “The definitive Story of life” by extracting myth, mystery, and imagination results in the reduction of both truth and story and a failure to comprehend what is at stake.

# Stranded in Grey Town — A Life Greatly Reduced

> Hell is a state of mind—ye never said a truer word. And every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind—is, in the end, Hell.  
> But Heaven is not a state of mind. Heaven is reality itself. All that is fully real is Heavenly. For all that can be shaken will be shaken and only the unshakeable remains.  
> —C.S. Lewis, *The Great Divorce*

> “It is not sufficient for us to be once called by the Lord, unless we live as new creatures. This is the long and short of it.”  
> —Calvin

> The word given and received in the gospel announced to us “begets” a new people whose life together might itself become, in turn, good news to the world.  
> —Douglas Harink

> The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed.  
> —Albert Einstein

## Stranger Than Fiction

In the film *Stranger Than Fiction*, Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, a solitary IRS agent whose life is suddenly narrated in real time by a disembodied female voice—controlling, predicting, and ultimately threatening his fate. Told his death is imminent, Harold realizes he must enter into the narrative, take action, and change his life's course, rather than succumb to mere routine.

Near the film’s end, the narrator observes:

> Harold Crick became stronger in who he was, what he wanted, and why he was alive... Harold Crick lived his life.

*Stranger Than Fiction* illustrates the universal desire to wake up from a passive existence and—before life is over—embrace a better story.

# A Third Reduction

In many ways, this is a parable of the contemporary Christian experience. If we are honest, the church has largely failed to live out the fullness of life Jesus has given. The eclipse of grandeur and failure to live into God’s story have a sad outcome: a cramped existence, eking out a spiritual life as it passes by.

In this chapter, as part of the first section exploring various reductionisms, we consider how God’s people often end up with a sad, attenuated, moralistic, adventure-less, and “churchy” spirituality.

Why would any pilgrim or seeker want a version of life offered by the average churchly Christian—one that is little better than eating pancakes when we have been called to experience “real and eternal life, more and better life than they ever dreamed of” (John 10:10 MSG)?

# Hell's Doors Are Locked from the Inside

Perhaps one of the starkest depictions of the reduced life appears in *The Great Divorce* by C. S. Lewis. The novel unfolds in Grey Town, a loveless, grumpy, and alienated "place," whose ghost-like inhabitants quarrel and drift endlessly apart. In Grey Town, anyone can have whatever house they dream of—but all is of poor quality and increasingly insubstantial.

In contrast, Lewis’ vision of heaven is a place where everything is granted on God’s terms—substantial, authentic gifts as opposed to Grey Town's emptiness. The novel imagines if the damned could board a bus from hell towards heaven and encounter the blessed, invited to give up their pride and accept mercy mid-journey. Astonishingly, almost all choose to return to Grey Town, freely preferring their thin existence to grace.

One of Lewis’ most sobering points: *many live in hell without knowing it*. For them, hellish existence is the norm—even among some who claim to be believers but refuse to follow Jesus.

Lewis wrote:

> Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing into a heavenly creature or into a hellish creature.<sup>6</sup>

Key to *The Great Divorce* is the realization that the damned are, in a sense, successful rebels—the doors of hell are locked from the inside.<sup>7</sup>

Our choices and perspectives matter immensely. There is a quality of heaven or hell in our daily decisions determining the meaning and trajectory of our lives—processes that begin long before death.

# Living Civilized in the United States of Generica

Timothy Tennent, President of Asbury Seminary, laments:

> Our long sojourn under the spell of Christendom has also meant that we find ourselves adhering to a rather domesticated version of the gospel... Christian identity and cultural identity became virtually seamless.<sup>9</sup>

David Bosch similarly observes:

> “Christianity has become nothing but the religious dimension of the culture... listening to the church, society hears only the sound of its own music.”<sup>10</sup>

Contemporary Christianity has become the product of a long domestication, smoothing away the gospel’s rough prophetic edges, and Mickey Goldmill’s words from *Rocky* apply: “The worst thing happened that could happen to any fighter: you got civilized.”<sup>11</sup>

Western Christians are now largely unaware of living out a significantly reduced good news.

# Unca Lonny Says

Lonny Davis, affectionately known as Unca Lonny, points out how many Christians effectively live as deists:

> Deism pretty much sums up the present state of things with regard to the faith posture of the Western world. It goes like this: God created the world, sent Jesus, gave us the Bible, and then walked away... We have to settle for a religion pretty much void of wonder, the supernatural, and an unmediated engagement with God, but we get to go to church instead...<sup>12</sup>

Sociologists Christian Smith and Melinda Lundquist Denton identified this phenomenon as “Moralistic Therapeutic Deism” (MTD).<sup>13</sup> According to their research:

- **Moralistic**: Faith reduces to rules for a happy life—do not hurt others, be decent.
- **Therapeutic**: Religion serves as self-help, to be used as needed.
- **Deistic**: God is distant, uninvolved in daily life.

This renders faith reduced: knowledge about God without engagement or covenantal relationship—closed, codified, controlled. It is a life of “church-going goodness” never questioning if there is more than dutiful participation in programs—a belief that doing the right things (moralistic) results in happiness (therapeutic), for which you thank the distant God (deistic).

Why would anyone, pilgrim or seeker, desire a spiritual life built only around moral rules and happiness, sung to a far-off God?

A civilized, domesticated, MTD faith responds to life's great longings and questions with a shrug—a result both of sinful pride and a lack of dynamic openness to a God fully involved in every dimension of life.

### The Dangers of Closed Faith

This habit of closing off faith, of aiming for safety and security, leads only to meaninglessness and lovelessness. As C. S. Lewis wrote:

> There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable... Wrap your heart carefully... lock it up safe in the casket of selfishness. But in that casket... it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable... The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.<sup>15</sup>

---

# Settling, Atrophy, and Second Things

A hellish, loveless existence means a reduced life and settling for substitutes. Our occupational hazard as humans is to settle for less:

- We choose purity and piety when invited to exquisite holiness.
- We settle for fear-driven living instead of love.
- We cling to a small, vindictive god when nudged toward the God beyond any life.

Our “settling” and avoidance of transformation reduce us, chasing “second things” instead of “first things.” Even when we talk about “life to the full,” it is often defined in shallow terms: safety, security, prosperity.

Non-believers see the disconnect between what we say (“life to the full”) and what we live—and this discredits our testimony, rendering the story impotent.

True life in Christ is not safe or predictable; it is action, adventure, pain, struggle, joy, and resurrection. Abiding in Christ is as far from the banality of MTD as can be imagined.

As Walker Percy noted:

> We are the only civilization in history which has enshrined mediocrity as its cultural ideal.<sup>20</sup>

A life settled on second things and mediocrity is one of despair and hopelessness. A reduced, controlled life requires no faith and is the opposite of “the assurance of things you have hoped for” (Hebrews 11:1, The Voice).

# Less Than Ultimate: The Roots of Idolatry

Greg Boyd claims that at the source of all that is wrong with humans is a false, ugly—and we would add, “reduced”—mental image of God.<sup>21</sup> Adam and Eve believed the serpent’s story, leading to an impoverished, broken life separated from God. We repeat this error daily.

Our reduction of God leads inevitably to a reduction in life. The domino effect is clear: diminished views of God lead to diminished lives.

Idolatry is the ancient practice of reducing God—giving ourselves to “that which is less than ultimate.”<sup>23</sup> Paul Tillich explains: When anything becomes the source of our quest for unconditional love, worth, and security, it becomes an idol.<sup>24</sup>

Boyd describes varieties of idols:

- Seeking life in achievement, possessions, or impressing others.
- Chasing peak experiences to stave off boredom.
- Defining ourselves by what we can control, experience, or consume.

The Scriptures warn: we who worship idols become like them—empty, without meaning (Psalm 115:8, 135:18; Isaiah 44:9).

David Foster Wallace, in a commencement speech at Kenyon College, expressed it this way:

> There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And... pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive... Worship money and things—you'll never have enough... Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure—you will always feel ugly...[...] The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.<sup>27</sup>

Reduced gods, reduced stories—reduced lives. Grey Town.

# The False Presence of the Kingdom

Martin Buber wrote that the role of those who speak of God is to shatter the false security of idolatry and invite others into engagement with the sovereign God, who demands that we involve Him in all arenas of life. Jacques Ellul called the substitution of ritual for the real presence “the false presence of the Kingdom.”

Seasons of apparent safety and security eventually give way to moments of awakening—a chasm opens at our feet, and we must respond. Our only choice: continue in safety and rules, or risk dynamic engagement and responsibility.

Buber observes:

> Only in such “holy insecurity” can we approach the mystery of God.<sup>29</sup>

This is the *fear of the Lord*—the reverence, amazement, awe, and recognition of God’s otherness. It is the gateway to intimacy with God and to being radically receptive to God’s story (Proverbs 1:7, 9).

Idols pull us away from this relationship, betraying the Ultimate and ultimately failing to satisfy our needs and desires. We must call people into a story that exposes both the power of idols and of God—and the perils of settling for less than ultimate.

---

# A Loss of Wonder

So much is lost when we resign ourselves to a settled life—including the ability to wonder.

> “The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed.”<sup>32</sup>

A culture without wonder cannot invite anyone—including Harold Crick—into genuine story. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote:

> The awareness of grandeur and wonder has all but disappeared in the present age. Our educational system stresses control, power, and knowledge, but there is little education for wonder, for the sublime... The sense of wonder and awe... without it, the world becomes flat and the human person hollow.<sup>33</sup>

He suggested that indifference to wonder is “the root of all human failings.” We cast wonder aside, assuming all enigmas will be solved.

Heschel and Harold Crick came to a profound realization: a life void of awe and wonder—reduced to answers and right behaviors—is tragic, settling for mediocrity. Abundant life is not about answers, but about renewed wonder, vital questioning, and a search deeper than the nearest pancake house.

## The Worst of All Sins?

In Aimee Bender’s “The Doctor and the Rabbi,” the rabbi cautions:

> At the end of your life, you will need to apologize to God for the ways you have not lived.  
> “Not for the usual sins,” she said. “But for the sin of living small.”<sup>35</sup>

---

# Section 2: A Longing

There is so much that has been lost through our reduction of God, story, and life. Section one has detailed factors that have eclipsed our vision of God and the consequences for the Church and culture alike—a loss of big-picture perspective.

In section two, we examine how our understanding of what it means to be human has also been reduced; not only are our theological frameworks narrowed, but our anthropological frames—how we understand people—have diminished as well.

All of us suffer a diminished view of humanity. We must look again at the human search for meaning, a quest that involves the deepest aspects of our natures. Humans are inherently created for the divine, and how we seek fulfillment in this realm marks the difference between meaning and meaninglessness.

*The Spiritual Anatomy of Desire*

> —Elizabeth Barrett Browning

I (Mark) met Alex three weeks into the Camino de Santiago. Alex—a thirty-something London Underground manager—walked slowly, yet always found her way to each day's destination. After a long day’s walk, meals were shared with fellow pilgrims. One evening, Alex led the discussion:

- What was the best part of your day?
- What was the most beautiful thing you saw?
- What will be different in your life after the pilgrimage?

When her turn came, Alex began: “First of all, just so you know, I don’t believe in God.” Yet she described her day with poetic awe, marveling at creation and sensing deep transformation. She wanted to make a difference. Her words described a restless longing—a stirring in her soul.

Three days later, I saw Alex again. I told her: “You said you didn’t believe in God. I don’t believe you. I think you know there’s Something out there bigger than you, calling you to a different life. The god you don’t believe in is probably one I don’t believe in either.”

As David Brooks wrote in *The New York Times*:

> [Faith] begins for many people with an elusive experience of wonder and mystery. These moments provide an intimation of ethical perfection and merciful love. They arouse a longing within many people to integrate that glimpsed eternal goodness into their practical lives. This longing is faith...<sup>2</sup>

That is what I should have said.

# The Question and the Quest

Albert Einstein suggested that given one hour to solve a problem, he would spend the first fifty-five minutes determining the right question. Evangelicals, however, are often uncomfortable with questions. To understand the “Alexes” of our world, we must remain curious and willing to explore.

Our inability for holy curiosity has led us to a diminished understanding of God, and of people—a failed missional understanding.

We need a reframation: a fresh look at what has become all too familiar, enlarging our capacity to see human existence as more than just separation from God, but as a struggle with meaning, tragedy, and desire. Without a renewed index of the human soul, our proclamation will lack resonance—reduced, flavorless.

# A Missional Anthropology

In *The Culture Code*, Clotaire Rapaille demonstrates the importance of proper cultural exegesis. He observed that marketers often fail, not by asking questions, but by not asking the right ones—not uncovering the primal emotional “imprints” that drive behavior.<sup>4</sup> These imprints contribute to a collective “culture code”—the unconscious meanings we attach to things.

Rapaille’s research for Chrysler on the Jeep Wrangler revealed that Jeep’s “code” in America is *HORSE*: the desire for rugged, open freedom. Luxury appointments did not fit; what people wanted was the primal sense of adventure. The adjusted marketing was a huge success.

Similarly, the people we meet on the Camino and at Burning Man have imprints of faith—stories, memories, emotional associations, disappointments, and hopes. If we do not understand these primal encounters, we cannot meaningfully reframe their (or our own) understanding of God.

---

# A Dialectic of Desire

The first step in developing a missional anthropology is wrestling honestly with questions:

- What do we really desire?
- What are our deepest longings?
- What are we searching for?

James K. A. Smith, philosopher and theologian, asserts that culture is not primarily intellectual—humans are not first of all thinkers, but lovers.<sup>9</sup>

> Human persons are fundamentally lovers and if you start here and understand this, that will generate a very different account of what culture is.

To know a person, we must know:

- What do you want?
- What do you love?

Smith’s insight: we are defined by our desires. And this is not a new idea...
