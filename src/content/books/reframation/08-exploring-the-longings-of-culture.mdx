# Exploring the Longings of Culture

> "The effect of the brokenness in the world is not that we stop being lovers, not that it turns off our love and desires. The effect of sin and brokenness and fallenness is that we start loving the wrong things."  
> —James K. A. Smith

## The Scent of a Flower We Have Not Found

Songs and movies are some of the most fertile grounds for cultural detective work. The lyrical content alone is vast and significant. Try reading the lyrics of great songs—by U2, Bob Dylan, Tupac, Hozier, Passenger, Joni Mitchell, or Kanye West—and assess their poetic strength. But go beyond the lyrics: What is the mood of the music? What makes it resonate with the soul’s search for beauty, justice, relationship, and spirituality?

Similarly, pay attention to films that resonate with your community. Movies provide multiple clues about our culture. Ask yourself:

- What questions are these films answering?
- What yearnings are they appealing to?
- Who is the viewer bonding with, and why?
- Does the movie embody a cry for redemption, rescue, adventure, love, or lament the despair of lovelessness?

These are foundational, existential questions that concern us all.

To explore the nature of the religious quest, both implicit and explicit, suspend your judgment about whether you agree or disagree. Outline the basic themes of the human search for meaning, identity, purpose, and belonging as revealed not only in overt forms of religion but also in art, poetry, and literature. At root, all people are spiritual—humanity is haunted by divinity.

Paul’s example in Athens teaches us to consider not only the “what” but also the “why” of cultural expressions. The deepest longings of humanity remain persistent, regardless of brokenness, pain, or even “unbelief.” The search is always on. The good news is that people are looking for the right thing; the bad news is that they are often looking in the wrong places.

As Johnny Lee sings in *Urban Cowboy*: “We are looking for love in all the wrong places.” Even the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode “Looking for par’Mach in All the Wrong Places” (with *par’Mach* being the Klingon word for “love, but with more aggressive overtones”) illustrates this universal phenomenon: the search for good things in the wrong places.

C.S. Lewis reflected on these longings:

> "The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came through them, and what came through them was longing. These things—the beauty, the memory of our own past—are good images of what we really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself, they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their worshippers. For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited."
>
> —C.S. Lewis, *The Weight of Glory*

### Recognizing Misdirected Longings

Whether it’s a person knocking on the door of a brothel or swiping right on Tinder, the deep yearnings remain the same, though the direction of desire may be disordered or broken. Rather than judging these actions, ask: what is really being sought? Is it connection, relief from pain, power, or the quest for Beauty? Even addiction can be understood as a misdirected search for ecstasy, escape from suffering, or the shame of meaninglessness—a hunger at the very core of our being for something only God can fulfill.

Addiction and idolatry provide insight into our inner motivations. As Augustine wrote, there are not only ordered loves but also disordered loves; all vices are virtues gone wrong. As C.S. Lewis poignantly noted:

> "It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased."
>
> —C.S. Lewis

Recognizing these misdirected desires in ourselves cultivates empathy. We are all beggars showing other beggars where to find the bread, and that understanding forms the basis for authentic connection across cultural and personal divides.

# Unwrapping the Wounds of Culture

The gospel’s good news is this: even in the midst of humanity’s common brokenness, Jesus has entered our world, offering the opportunity to find what we seek in the right place. We can look to Jesus for an example of how to do this.

In John 4, Jesus “had to go through Samaria,” a region marked by division and centuries of animosity. At a well, he meets a Samaritan woman ostracized from her community. By asking for a drink, he breaks both ethnic and gender barriers. Their conversation goes deeper:

> Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.”  
> The woman answered, “I have no husband.”  
> Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!”  
> —John 4:16–18 NRSV

Notice, there is no condemnation in Jesus’ tone—only compassion. He appeals to her deepest longings, uncovering the cycles of brokenness that have neither met her needs nor fulfilled her desires. In response, she changes the subject to religious debates—safer territory than vulnerability. Jesus, however, redirects her attention from religious places toward personal encounter with God.

Jesus bridges the distance, transgressing cultural norms and offering what she has always sought—a reframation of her understanding of the divine.

# Romancing the City (Like Getting Caught in the Rain)

> "If the signals of transcendence have become rumors in our time, then we can set out to explore these rumors—and perhaps to follow them up to their source."
>
> —Peter Berger

> "If you love each thing, you will perceive the mystery of God in things."
>
> —Zosima in *The Brothers Karamazov*

> "Being incarnational is like getting married. Being incarnational is like making love. Being incarnational is like candlelit dinners. Being incarnational is like Piña Coladas and getting caught in the rain."
>
> —Michael Frost

Recall the awkward “engagement interview” of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer. When prompted if they were “in love,” Diana responded, “Of course”; Charles hesitantly replied, “Well, I suppose so ... whatever being in love means.” Such cautious, transactional affection is no model for the church’s approach to evangelism.

The church must not follow the “Prince Charles way of thinking,” relying on grand gestures or ceremonial declarations alone. Instead, we must learn to truly court those we encounter—moving beyond episodic or “speed-dating” encounters and into the daily, attentive, persistent work of relationship-building.

Just as a healthy marriage requires ongoing acts of wooing and deep listening beyond the ceremony, so too must our evangelistic engagement move beyond grand gestures to rhythms of attentive, loving presence.

## The Art of Paying Attention

Australian missional leader John Smith exemplified prevenient grace by making it his practice to find out what God was already doing in unexpected places. Once, after an event, a young woman invited him to continue their conversation at a local strip club. Smith went, listened to her story of heartbreak, hope, and estrangement from the church, and witnessed her weaving her loss of faith into her art. That evening, he prayed with her as she recommitted herself to Jesus—right there in the strip club.

Smith’s question to his audience was simple: “Was Jesus in that strip club that night?” The only biblical answer: “Yes, of course.” God is indeed present in places of tragedy, longing, and brokenness.

The point is not that every believer should evangelize in such places, but that we must learn to pay attention—wherever we are—to the activity of God who precedes us.

### Find Out What God Is Already Doing

> "The truth is that the Son does nothing on His own; all these actions are led by the Father. The Son watches the Father closely and then mimics the work of the Father."
>
> —John 5:19, The Voice

Jesus modeled attentive presence, seeking out what the Father was already doing in each context and joining in. Our primary task is to become aware of God’s activity in every person, place, and situation.

Brad Brisco reminds us that “the primary activity of God is in the world, and the church is the chief instrument created by God to be sent into the world to participate in what he is already doing.” Lesslie Newbigin similarly writes that mission is enacted by the Spirit, who always goes before the church.

Guder notes that when missionaries enter a new place, “they do not bring the gospel: Christ, as Lord over heaven and earth, is already there.”

This theme stretches back to early church teachings—*praeparatio evangelica*—recognizing that God’s grace and presence are anticipated in every human heart and culture.

## Finding God in a Thorny Shrub

In Exodus 3, Moses encounters God in the burning bush—a theophany that had likely been present for some time, unrecognized until Moses paid attention. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner suggests: “The burning bush was not a miracle. It was a test. God wanted to find out whether or not Moses could pay attention to something for more than a few minutes. When Moses did, God spoke.”

Are we too busy to notice the holy ground beneath our feet, or the invitations God extends amidst our crowded schedules? As Frederick Buechner reflects:

> "Day by day, year by year, your own story unfolds...The unexpected sound of your name on somebody’s lips. The good dream. The odd coincidence. The moment that brings tears to your eyes. The person who brings life to your life. Maybe even the smallest events hold the greatest clues. If it is God we are looking for...maybe the reason we haven’t found him is that we are not looking in the right places. Pay attention."

## The Art of Listening

Learning to listen well is essential to cultural engagement. Too often, the church prefers to talk rather than listen, like a bad first date. Yet every culture, every person, is telling us how to love them—how to bring good news—if we will listen.

Mike Breen recalls missionaries in India who offered to build grand projects, but the local leaders simply asked for a PIN code so they would be recognized as a legitimate community. By truly listening, the missionaries realized that registration—and thus recognition—was the real good news their hosts needed.

Often, churches proclaim from soapboxes, failing to listen or dialogue. What would it look like to reverse the megaphone—listening with amplification rather than broadcasting our message louder?

### Listening to Everyone’s Story

Research in *Church Refugees* highlights common tensions among those who have left the church:

- They wanted community, but got judgment.
- They wanted to affect the life of the church, but got bureaucracy.
- They wanted conversation, but got doctrine.
- They wanted meaningful engagement with the world, but got moral prescription.

The deep longing is for authentic community—a home where people are known, loved, challenged, and can make a meaningful impact.

## The Art of Interpathy

> "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."
>
> —Atticus Finch, *To Kill a Mockingbird*

Interpathy—a term used by missiologists—describes a cross-cultural form of empathy, “feeling with” the other, climbing into another’s skin. It involves bracketing one’s own beliefs long enough to enter a different world and to sense what matters most to another person or community.

A powerful illustration is the French poet Jacques Prévert, who, upon meeting a blind beggar whose sign read “Blind Man without a home,” rewrote it to “Spring is coming, but I won’t see it.” The new phrasing invited passersby into the blind man’s lived experience, opening their hearts rather than just their wallets.

To begin with observation, rather than applying preconceived theories or models, is to open yourself to the real needs and stories of others.

### Key Questions for Understanding a Neighborhood

Dory and Rich Gorman of NewStory Church recommend asking the following:

1. **Power**: Who are the powerful? Who are the powerless, and why? What does the gospel say about that?
2. **Pennies**: Who are the rich? Who are the poor? What does the gospel say about that?
3. **Pain**: Where is the pain in the neighborhood? What does the gospel say about that?
4. **Parties**: Where are the celebrations? How can we affirm and join in?
5. **Persons of Peace**: Who are the community’s gatekeepers, and how can we serve them?

Jon Ritner at Ecclesia Hollywood simplifies it: “Find out what sucks in the neighborhood, find others that agree with you, and do something about it.”

# Like Falling in Love for the First Time

These rhythms—of paying attention, listening, and practicing interpathy—allow us to discern what truly is good news for people in their context. Steve Hollinghurst writes:

> "Cross-cultural evangelism is not about changing the cultural clothing of an explanation of Jesus’ death, but finding which parts of the whole story are 'good news' within each culture and starting from these to explore the rest. The art of the skillful missionary is to read the unknown soil and understand the seeds in the gospel packet well enough to know which ones to plant first, to discern when they have taken root in a healthy way, and know when it is time to plant the seeds that will be harder to nurture."

As we engage cultures and people, may we offer news that is more than wishful thinking, more than an illusion to ease our anxieties. The good news of Jesus is cause for celebration, inviting a radically new situation into the world—like someone falling in love for the first time, awakened to a joy and fulfillment never before imagined.

# Afterword

> "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not more so."  
> —attributed to Albert Einstein

We live in a culture drawn to oversimplification and reductionism—flattening complex realities into slogans and programs. The church, too, succumbs to this temptation: reducing the gospel to a plan of salvation, turning mission into recruitment, and misunderstanding what it means to be missional.

As Walter Brueggemann observes:

> "The gospel is […] a truth widely held, but a truth greatly reduced. It is a truth that has been flattened, trivialized, and rendered inane. Partly, the gospel is simply an old habit among us, neither valued nor questioned. But more than that, our technical way of thinking reduces mystery to problem, transforms assurance into certitude, quality into quantity, and so takes the categories of biblical faith and represents them in manageable shapes."

We want to take a truth as big as an ox and compress it into a bouillon cube. We talk before we listen, argue before we converse, and assume before we know.  
But the gospel is wide and deep enough to surprise, challenge, and fulfill the deepest yearnings of all. 

G.K. Chesterton offers a concluding contrast:

> "Perhaps the shortest statement of it is that the Buddhist saint always has his eyes shut, while the Christian saint always has them wide open. The Buddhist is looking with a peculiar intentness inwards. The Christian is staring with frantic intentness outwards."
```
