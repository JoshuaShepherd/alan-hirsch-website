# Reframing Faith: Rediscovering the Art of Seeing

> “Prayer is the atmosphere of all conversion; other discourse leaves in shadow what the self does not wish to see.”  
> — Jean Danielou

## Looking “At” or “Through” a Window

I (Mark) lived for ten years in a beautiful, one-hundred-year-old home in a small, rural Midwestern town. Among its many unique features was the front corner window. Because of the home’s age and our limited funds, the windows remained the originals—old, oversized panes, five feet tall by five feet wide. Though several such windows graced the house, the front corner one was my favorite, mostly because of the view.

Our house stood on the corner of the main street, and by turning off all the lights and peering out through that window, I had a picturesque view—especially when it snowed. Looking through the window at falling snow, illuminated by the corner streetlight that made each flake shimmer, was, or nearly was, a holy experience.

Yet, one day when I examined a small crack in the lower right corner, I also noticed paint flecks from sloppy trim work, layers of dust, dirt, and enough ladybug corpses to fill an insect graveyard. From this perspective, the euphoric, holy experience vanished.

Here’s what I learned: there is a huge difference between looking at a window and looking through a window.

- Looking "at" the window, I saw cracked glass and dirt that needed attention.
- Looking "through" the window, I glimpsed the beautiful, snow-covered streets of my own personal Narnia.

How I saw the world depended on how I approached the window.

We need to see the world differently—to see the pilgrims on the Camino and Playa with another set of eyes. We can look at the window and see only overwhelming brokenness. Or, we can look through the window—beyond our assumptions and perceptions—and understand that perhaps all of us, believer and non-believer alike, have been peering through “narrow chinks of a cavern.”

## Lift Up Your Gates, You Ancient Doors!

Blake’s poetry suggests that instead of endlessly wandering deeper into the cave, we should approach the opening, even extend our heads through the aperture, where we can see things as they are—vast and unbounded.

To our collective condition—reductionism, idolatry, irresponsibility, withdrawal, fear, self-protection, rebellion, unreality—the psalmist calls us to cleanse our perception and fling open the ancient doors.

> The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it,  
> the world, and all who live in it;  
> for he founded it on the seas  
> and established it on the waters.  
> Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord?  
> Who may stand in his holy place?  
> The one who has clean hands and a pure heart,  
> who does not trust in an idol  
> or swear by a false god.  
> They will receive blessing from the Lord  
> and vindication from God their Savior.  
> Such is the generation of those who seek him,  
> who seek your face, God of Jacob.  
> Lift up your heads, you gates;  
> lift them up, you ancient doors,  
> that the King of glory may come in.  
> Who is he, this King of glory?  
> The Lord Almighty—he is the King of glory.  
> — **Psalm 24:1–7, 9–10**

We surely have some kind of role in leading people to deeper awareness—to tell a story where God’s reality is experienced, one richer and deeper than we have ever imagined. But how do we begin with a generation that seems unwilling to hear a story about a reality that has always been present?

Philosopher Martin Buber answered:

> "This generation must be made receptive [...] to the voice of the mystery which speaks in those utterances. And we should not do all this with the purpose of preparing them to repeat the teachings and perform rites, but so that they may acquire the power to make the original choice, that—listening to the voice with that power—they may hear the message it has for their hour and their work; that they may learn to trust the voice, and through this trust, come to faith, to a faith of their own."

Can we really make this generation receptive? Can we help “cleanse these doors of perception and open wide these ancient doors?”

## Section 3: A Re/Enchanting

In section one, we explored the eclipse of God and the reduction of our experience of Him, resulting in a diminished, heretical faith. In section two, we examined cultural and missional anthropology and confronted our longing and lack of knowledge, as well as our cave-dwelling existence. 

This third section introduces ways to reimagine our view of God and the world. To correct theological reductionism, we must recover the art of seeing God in larger and wider frames. Moving away from ossified doctrines and legalistic ethics, we propose a re/enchanting of that which has been drained from the story. Enlarging our perspectives, we will begin to see a “bigger” God and, consequently, live and tell a bigger, more beautiful story.

# The Art of Seeing: A Re[Framed] Vision of God and Gospel

> "The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes."  
> — Marcel Proust

> "Design. Story. Symphony. Empathy. Play. Meaning. These six senses increasingly will guide our lives and shape our world."  
> — Daniel H. Pink

> "Lacking a systematic framework for understanding the clash of forces in today’s world, we are like a ship’s crew, trapped in a storm, navigating between dangerous reefs without compass or chart. In a culture of warring specialisms, drowned in fragmented data and analysis, synthesis is not merely useful—it is crucial."  
> — Alvin Toffler

In *The Art of Seeing*, Aldous Huxley recounts how, at sixteen, an attack of keratitis punctata (an inflammation of the cornea) rendered him nearly blind. For the next several years, he relied on Braille and a guide to walk and read, until a method of “visual re-education” enabled him to learn to see again—eventually, better than he’d managed for years.

Huxley realized that ophthalmology had focused solely on the physiological, neglecting the mind that makes use of the eyes. Perceiving and comprehending requires engagement of the mind (nous), synthesized with the senses. Sensing is not the same as perceiving; while our eyes and nervous system sense, the mind perceives. Improvement in perception brings improvement in sensing. This is what Huxley calls “the art of seeing”—an active, disciplined approach to re-educating oneself to perceive anew, much like the habits unconsciously acquired in childhood: seeing with the enchanted eyes of a child.

### The Genius of Both/And

Organization guru Jim Collins observed that many problems arise when we think in ever more analytical, reduced terms; these ideas then monopolize our thinking. To break free—to instigate real, systemic change—we must learn to view things in terms of wholeness, synthesis, and possibility.

Reductionist thinking, which he calls the “Tyranny of the OR,” is unable to accept mystery or paradox, forcing either/or answers. This leads, in William Blake’s words, to seeing “all things thro’ narrow chinks of his cavern.”

Consider:

- Theological controversies and denominational splits are built upon ever-reducing understandings.
- The word *denomination* itself is inherently sectarian.

Opposed to the “Tyranny of the OR” is the “Genius of the AND”—embracing synthesis, holding together multiple possibilities, finding unity in diversity.

> "In any mosaic, the pattern is only visible when we step back and see the wondrous whole. The meaning of all the pieces is found in the completed whole." — Michael Heiser

To heal, we must always attempt to resituate the broken pieces within the context of the whole. This is at the heart of Jesus’ atoning work—a call to wholeness.

We suggest that the main clue for escaping the heresy of reduction is to realize that the answer is always bigger than we think; every partial truth must be located within the totality from which it is drawn.

Let us think both/and: truth and goodness and beauty; faith and hope and grace; love and truth and obedience.

### Paradoxology

Foundational Christian truths are paradoxical. Paradox is the dynamic holding together of irreconcilable poles—like the Trinity, the Incarnation, predestination and free will. These truths require “adoring eyes of faith,” a love for mystery, and respect for paradox.

> "All the central truths of Christianity only reveal themselves to those who love the incomprehensibility of mystery and can respect paradoxical truth. The paradox is the truth … To attempt to resolve it is to lose its dynamic."

What if the tension between apparently opposing doctrines is where faith comes alive? What if Christianity survives not despite, but because of, its apparent contradictions?

Krish Kandiah’s *Paradoxology* claims that paradox is vital for a vibrant faith. Only by wrestling with paradoxes can we truly worship God.

When paradox is lost, we end up with:

- Unbelieving doubt that avoids awe
- Sentimental liberalism
- Black-and-white fundamentalism

### Just Wiggle Your Shoulders Like This

I (Alan) was recently at an exhibition of Wassily Kandinsky’s abstract works. Kandinsky tried to paint music—visualizing what he was hearing. In an interview, he advised viewers to look with the eyes of a child. Like Jesus’ advice to become like children, we must re-educate our eyes for the art of seeing.

Children are humble, playful, always learning—traits necessary for entering God’s kingdom (Matthew 18:3–4). The early Church Fathers and Mothers, similarly, approached God with humble, curious wonder, plumbing the depths of His beauty, goodness, and truth.

> “The feeling of wonderment is the inexhaustible fountainhead of the child’s desire for knowledge. The adult who no longer wonders merely shows that he has lost the art of reflective reasoning.”  
> — Max Planck

As noted in chapter two, God is transcendent and immanent; we must widen our perception to discern the presence of God in everything.

> "Earth’s crammed with heaven,  
> And every common bush afire with God;  
> But only he who sees, takes off his shoes,  
> The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries,  
> And daub their natural faces unaware."  
> — Elizabeth Barrett Browning

> “The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in the way ... As a man is, so he sees.”  
> — William Blake

To live in God’s world is to have a willingness to see through the spiritual eyes of faith—a paradigm shift of vision.

> “When the service was over that day I walked out of it into a God-enchanted world, where every leaf, every ant, every shiny rock called out to me—begging to be watched, listened to, handled. I became a detective of divinity, collecting evidence of God’s genius ...”  
> — Barbara Brown Taylor

Ben (a friend of Alan’s) once played a “mad scientist” for kindergartners. When he explained magnets, a little girl insisted it was “magic.” Ben had to agree—sometimes, you have to simply “wiggle your shoulders like this and let go ...”

### Always Yearning, Always Learning

In *Your God Is Too Small*, J. B. Phillips called Christians to reframe their understanding of God. He argued that the trouble in contemporary faith is that our conception of God is too limited for this expanding, complex world. Our inherited maps no longer fit the territories.

If we truly believe in a God who created the cosmos, then we should expect to have our minds blown at every encounter. Consider the incalculable size of the universe, and that the being we call “God” spoke all into existence.

If we recast God’s love and grace in a wider frame, consider the Incarnation: the eternal, all-knowing God emptied Himself to enter into our limited human experience, enduring the depths of darkness and sin on our behalf. Why would the Infinite do this for us? Because of inconceivable love—grace beyond measure.

Consider Nicodemus (John 3), overwhelmed by Jesus’ words. To encounter Jesus is to have the doors blown off of our small-minded religious assumptions. His call is always to more: a bigger God. A bigger story. A bigger life.

The unquenchable yearning for God persists—even at the end of all things. Augustine called this “insatiable satisfaction.” In seeing the Face that surpasses all desire, "we will be insatiably satisfied, without growing weary. We will always be hungering and always being filled."

> “We will have attuned the ear for that Voice, which, once heard, leaves one forever listening. When God sends His own living Word to His creatures, He does so not to inform them about the mysteries of the world, nor primarily to fulfill their deepest needs, but to actively demonstrate such unheard-of things that man is left awestruck by a love he could never have hoped to experience.”

### Learn More, Understand Less

A lament of contemporary Christianity is our failure to instill a love of learning—a searching theology that rests in the mysteries of God. Where in our faith communities are we grappling with the deep things? Where can the “Jacobs” wrestle with God? Churches often prioritize entertaining, three-point sermons with no room for dialogue, leaving us immature in the faith.

Our call is to:

- Learn. Feed yourself and others.
- Read the greats, beyond your own tradition.
- Engage books, podcasts—challenge yourself.
- Learn together in diverse community.

> “Wisdom is the recovery of innocence at the far end of experience; it is the ability to see again what most have forgotten how to see ... God is not only the ultimate reality sought by intellect and will, but is also the primordial reality engaged in every moment. Only when we understand this do we know what the word ‘God’ truly means.”  
> — David Bentley Hart

## From a One-Dimensional to a Three-Dimensional Gospel

Re-educating our vision applies not only to God but also to the gospel itself. Our reduced explanations of the good news need reframing. Core existential questions—identity, justice, belonging, purpose, brokenness, allegiance—inform how people receive the gospel, and cultural narratives matter.

### The Western Frame

- Focus: **Guilt/Innocence, True/False, Right/Wrong**
- Emphasis: Individual, personal salvation
- Metaphor: Legal standing before God—substitutionary atonement, forensic righteousness
- Limitation: When isolated, becomes a reduced “gospel of sin-management”

### The Eastern Frame

- Focus: **Honor/Shame, Grace/Disgrace**
- Emphasis: Relational, community standing, loss or restoration of honor
- Shame is pervasive; it is about who one is, not just what one has done. It is felt internally and collectively.
- Predominant in 65% of the world, 80% of the unreached. Honor/shame is the pivotal cultural value throughout Scripture.
- Limitation: Western theologies struggle to see beyond their own cultural paradigms.

### The Southern Frame

- Focus: **Power/Powerlessness, Fear/Freedom**
- Emphasis: Bondage/freedom, political and communal dynamics
- The awareness of spiritual forces, the role of liberation, and community-based justice are central.
- The gospel must address liberation from oppression, redemption from bondage, and engagement with supernatural realities.

---

### The “Glocal” Gospel

In our globalized world, all three perspectives increasingly coexist. People now experience:

- **Guilt:** The need for forgiveness for broken standards
- **Shame:** The need for honor, dignity, acceptance, and love
- **Fear:** The need for freedom—from oppression, bondage, or spiritual forces

A comprehensive proclamation is needed—addressing the full spectrum of human experience:

- **Forgiveness** addresses guilt.
- **Unconditional love and acceptance** address shame.
- **Redemption and liberation** address powerlessness and fear.

#### Examples in Contemporary Culture

- **Shame:** Permeates Western cultures through competitiveness, celebrity aesthetics, and the resulting sense of “losing.”
- **Power/Powerlessness:** Social movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo reflect the craving for justice, dignity, and freedom from oppression.
- **Guilt:** Remains foundational—God forgives real sins, establishing right relationship. We are also called to forgive others.

A reframed gospel must address guilt, shame, and fear, as well as related existential issues: depression, loneliness, alienation, meaninglessness, addiction. God’s good news places us in family, gives purpose, reclaims identity, offers eternal hope, and pursues us relentlessly.

> Why settle for a one-dimensional gospel when there is so much more good news to experience?

## So Many More Rooms

In *5Q*, I (Alan) wrote that to grow in God, we must first unlearn. The first price of admission to the "symphony of fullness" is repentance—an openness to unlearning, to regular metanoia. After conversion, we don't just look at reality; we look out from within it. Paul’s phrase “in Christ” expresses such participation: “I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.” (Galatians 2:20) A transformed life is not self-authored, but God-authored.

Embracing a bigger picture will require change—letting go of obsolete ideas and opening both eyes and heart to growth and maturity. Breakthroughs arise when we step out of arbitrary, conventional boundaries—when we dare to open new doors.

> “God’s will is mystery and remains so as well. God introduces us into this mystery ... every aspect of God’s mystery that he gives us to understand is surrounded by mystery and opens into greater mystery.”  
> — Adrienne von Speyr

Have we settled for a one-room perspective of God and the gospel, believing our tradition’s room is the whole palace? There is so much more to God. When we admit there are more rooms to explore, we open ourselves to repentance and re-education. Keeping nothing assumed, we may be drawn—sometimes in fear and trembling—through doors we never before dared open.

# The Great Re[Framation]: Stealing Past the Watchful Dragons

> "God is the perfect poet who in his person acts his own creations."  
> — Robert Browning

> "Awe is the finest portion of mankind: However scarce the world may make this sense—In awe one feels profoundly the immense."  
> — Goethe

> “In our world,” said Eustace, “a star is a huge ball of flaming gas.”  
> “Even in your world, my son, that is not what a star is but only what it is made of.”  
> — C. S. Lewis

The *Chronicles of Narnia* by C. S. Lewis—a world of talking animals, mythical beasts, and “a deeper magic still”—narrate the adventures of children in a fantasy land, but are far from mere escapism. Lewis bemoaned the “parochial moralism” of Sunday School religion, which he felt quenched natural desire for God and hindered faith.

Lewis likened these inhibitions to watchful dragons that must be bypassed to find true knowledge of God. Story, through imagination, sneaks past these dragons. By casting potent truths into imaginative narrative, we see them for the first time in their real potency.

> "But supposing that by casting all these things into an imaginary world, stripping them of their stained-glass and Sunday School associations, one could make them for the first time appear in their real potency? Could one not thus steal past those watchful dragons? I thought one could."  
> — C. S. Lewis

Stories require a “willing suspension of disbelief.” Unlike lectures, which often meet resistance, stories bypass defenses and reach deeper places. Upon returning to reality, stories leave us seeing the world with more clarity and joy—enlivening the familiar, enriching the known, and most swiftly penetrating the human heart. Jesus himself understood this power better than anyone.

Lewis’ Narnia was thus not an escape from reality, but a means to rediscover what is most real.
