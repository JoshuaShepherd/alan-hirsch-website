# Afterword

> "So these days. As I’ve mentioned, we seem to prefer our eyes closed to complexity. That is until a book like this one shakes us from our slumber and demands we look again. And having seen it, we cannot look away. We cannot un-see what has been revealed to us."

As you reach the conclusion of this book, a clear burden of responsibility now falls on you. Alan and Mark have fulfilled theirs. Those of us who have heard and seen—whose doors have been blown from their hinges, whose windows have been shattered, who now see as they hadn’t seen before—are charged with the duty to act on what we now know.

Alan and Mark began this book by expressing their deep conviction “that there is a great need for a reframation that allows us to see God, people, and mission through re/enchanted frames.” Now, as you close these pages, you are left with an incredible commission: to tell and to live the full story of God wherever you find yourself—in your town, village, suburb, on the Camino, at Burning Man, or wherever God may send you in this world.

# Appendix 1  
## The Great Omission

Perhaps the most significant factor contributing to the dilution of our sense of life and humanity is what we can call the non-discipleship of the church—or what Dallas Willard termed "The Great Omission" (as an inversion of the Great Commission of Matthew 28:16–20).[^1] In fact, non-discipleship might be the single biggest flaw in the Western form of Christianity. It is almost as if the church as we know it is designed to exclude active discipleship and to encourage stunted forms of Christianity—remember, we know the tree by its fruit.

### What Is Discipleship? What Is at Stake?

At its core, discipleship is a Jesus-saturated affair:  
- It is based squarely on Jesus.  
- Discipleship involves actively modeling my life on his (imitation of Christ) and the willingness to let him live his life in and through me (union or abiding in Christ).

Discipleship is how Jesus gets into his church. It has rightly been said that discipleship means being who Jesus would be if he were you.[^2] Or perhaps, it is doing the kind of things Jesus did for the same sorts of reasons.

Discipleship is the means by which Jesus establishes a people and a community rooted in the ideal of human holiness, embodied and exemplified in him. Jesus is not only my Savior (though he is that), but he is also my Hero (someone I want to be like) and my Lord, whose life and words contain eternal life that can and must be accessed now.

Making disciples was clearly at the center of Jesus’ own approach to changing the world. Over time, however, the church became the dominant religion and settled into a domesticated form. The active focus on following and imitating Jesus has been incrementally replaced with simply believing certain tenets about him. Objective, theological-confessional language has replaced the immediate and subjective knowledge of Jesus that is gained by actively adhering to him. As a result, the more human—and revolutionary—image of Jesus himself has been effectively decentered.

In some Protestant circles (particularly Lutheran and Calvinist), Jesus is less and less the example and Lord, and more the eternal Savior. Many theologians in these traditions assert that Jesus cannot be held as the ideal human image because it’s an impossible standard to follow, and any attempt to do so simply creates guilt. As a result, they have effectively abandoned the imitation of Christ as an ideal of Christian life.

In this view:
- The purpose of the Incarnation (and other dimensions of Christ's person and work) has meaning only in substantiating the work accomplished on the cross.
- Jesus simply became one of us in order to save us on the cross.
- The model of his humanity (and thus his teachings) have limited authority for Christian life.

This is exactly what Bonhoeffer condemns as "cheap grace": a highly selective view of the work of Christ.[^3] As shown in the diagram below, this reduction elevates the cross (and perhaps the resurrection) over all other key dimensions of Christology. In theological jargon, one might say these interpreters have reduced Christology to soteriology. Its heretical implications are easy to discern.

### What Is Lost?

The loss in this reduction related to the central person in the biblical story is phenomenal.
- Its impact on our understanding of Jesus and the gospel, as well as of discipleship and spirituality, is immeasurable.
- If Jesus is not put front and center in the cosmos—not just in the church (the Alpha and Omega)—and not considered the archetypal human being (the Second Adam), then the theological system is broken where it matters most.
- Without an active vision and following of Jesus, the gospel becomes just another ideology.

As a result, we have ended up with an attenuated, ideologically co-opted gospel that limits the work of Jesus to the private salvation of the soul while having little to say beyond the narrow confines of the privatized individual. More dangerously, a church without discipleship always ends up with what Bonhoeffer calls a Christ-less Christianity, as seen in pre-war Germany—and in the culturally captive evangelical church in our day.

> “Discipleship means adherence to Christ and, because Christ is the object of that adherence, it must take the form of discipleship. An abstract Christology, a doctrinal system, a general religious knowledge on the subject of grace or the forgiveness of sins renders discipleship superfluous and positively excludes any idea of discipleship whatever. They are essentially inimical to the whole conception of following Christ. With an abstract idea, it is possible to enter into a relation of formal knowledge, to become enthusiastic about it, and perhaps even to put it into practice, but it can never be followed in personal obedience. Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Christianity without discipleship, and Christianity without discipleship is always Christianity without Christ. It remains an abstract idea, a myth which has a place for the Fatherhood of God but omits Christ as the living Son. And a Christianity of that kind is nothing more or less than the end of discipleship. In such a religion there is […] no following of Christ.”[^4]

This is a very dangerous reduction that inevitably leads to false and oppressive religion—as history sadly demonstrates.[^5]

### The Point

The aim here is not to offer a precise definition of discipleship, but to highlight what we lose when we fail to make discipleship central in the life of the church. The loss of the living and active presence of Christ among his people means the loss of the life he came to bring to those who adhere to him (John 10:10).

# Appendix 2  
## Blinded By Disobedience

Visitors to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at Langley, Virginia, are confronted with the slogan:

> "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."  
> —John 8:32 (KJV)

Besides this being a rather blasphemous appropriation of the words of our Lord, this application nonetheless reflects the generally held view that any truth, regardless of context or origin, can set the knower free. But this is not what Jesus was saying.

True knowledge of God is always tied to repentance and change. Any theological truth—truth about God—requires something far more demanding and personal from the would-be knower.

Jesus actually attaches a covenantal condition to the promise in John 8:  
> “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”  
> —John 8:31–32

The freedom Jesus promises is conditional on discipleship. Similarly, he says in John 7:17 that one must be predisposed to obey God in order to discern the truth:
> “Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.”

And, in the parable of the wise and foolish builders, Jesus warns:
> “Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.”  
> —Matthew 7:26

James explicitly admonishes:
> “Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror, and after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.”  
> —James 1:22–24

In summary, true knowledge of God can only be gained through a relationship with God and obedience to him. As Calvin says:
> "All knowledge is born in obedience […] God cannot be truly served unless we obey his voice."[^2]

Without discipleship, there can be no true—nor liberating—knowledge of God.
> “Only he who believes is obedient, and only he who is obedient believes.”[^3]

The Scriptures teach what we might call a bias toward obedient action. In other words, faith is not just about belief systems or dogmas, as we have often made it:
> “The Word of God is telling us very clearly that if you do not do it, you, in fact, do not believe it and have not heard or understood it.”[^4]

#### Consequences

When believers confess who Jesus is, they also, and inevitably, confess what they must become. Jesus is not an objective datum to be examined in neutrality. The statement “You are the Christ” (Mark 8:29) imposes a claim on the one who says it. The Son of Man calls those who would know him to follow him.

We cannot know Jesus without, in principle, first submitting to his claims and then learning to obey him. The intrinsic non-discipleship of our inherited forms of Christianity means that we cannot truly interpret or understand the Scriptures. As a result, we have ended up with a reduced understanding of God’s Word—just as Bonhoeffer confronted within culturally captive Christianity in pre-war Germany.

Bonhoeffer notes:
> “By eliminating simple obedience on principle, we drift into an unevangelical interpretation of the Bible. We take it for granted as we open the Bible that we have a key to its interpretation.”[^6]

Obedience unlocks the meaning of Scripture; disobedience obscures and even distorts the intended meaning. When Scripture calls us to hear, it means to listen with the intent to obey.[^7]

> “To deal with the word of Jesus otherwise than by doing it is to give him the lie […] The word we thought we had was not Christ’s, but a word we had wrested from him and made our own by reflecting on it instead of doing it.”[^8]

By leaving obedience and discipleship out of our interpretive framework, we will never faithfully understand Scripture, nor can we gain true knowledge of God.

#### In Summary

- Disobedient, non-discipling Christianity leads to a heretical, deistic, "god-in-the-back-pocket" religion.
- Discipleship is the right way for us to come to a knowledge of God.
- Non-discipleship cannot deliver a true knowledge of God.

# Appendix 3  
## Having the Mind of Christ

One of the ways we have limited our vision is by looking at the world through the distorting lens of what Paul calls "the flesh" and its associated rationality. The fleshly mind is contrasted with the spiritual mind. Each "mind" is, in essence, a paradigm—a way of seeing and interpreting the world.

The fleshly mind interprets the world from a self-oriented perspective, excluding information that can only be apprehended by the "spiritual" or "mature" mind. This is echoed in the distinction Paul draws between the "Spirit and the letter" of the Word (2 Corinthians 3:4–6). The fleshly person, focusing solely on the literal Word, fails to recognize God and the things of God—they simply cannot "get it." To use another metaphor, they cannot see the real meaning of things from within the darkness of the cave.

Because Christ lives in those who have received the Spirit, their stance and outlook can be those of Christ; in this sense they are "spiritual."  
- Life in the Spirit is about how we read the world and how the world reads us.
- The spiritual person sees the world as a space filled with the sacred and the possibility of sacredness; everything carries meaning and possibility because it is a world where God truly reigns.

This perspective does not mean spiritual people are experts in every area, only that they are able to appraise all things spiritually. Conversely, the worldly (soulish—psychichoi) person refuses this vision; the self and its survival become everything. The "false self" refuses God’s reign and actively objects to it, resulting in spiritual blindness:

- Life in the flesh is closed and ultimately tragic.
- There are depths and dimensions to life in the Spirit which those living on the merely human plane (1 Corinthians 2:14) simply cannot fathom.

Jesus, Paul, and John write about perception: the issue of seeing through spiritual rather than worldly eyes. This is what it means to have our perceptions cleansed and opened to the realm of God through the Spirit—seeing things from the perspective of eternity.

> "But we have the mind of Christ."  
> —1 Corinthians 2:16 (cf. Philippians 2:5–8)

This means that the believer is able to understand Jesus' *nous* (paradigm), his way of thinking, as revealed in and through God’s Spirit who mediates Jesus to us. Jesus’ paradigm is the "realm of the real," a worldview in sync with God’s will:  
> "I only do/see/speak as I see the Father doing/seeing/speaking."  
> —John 5:19, 8:28, 12:49

This opens up a whole new way of seeing for the believer—a flinging open of the doors of perception to see the world as the Son sees it, to experience it as he does. Living under the sovereign lordship of Jesus, we must do all we can to see the world through Christ's mind, rationality, and perspective.

The Holy Spirit is God with us and will enable us to live into what the Bible calls the reign of God.

### How Do We Begin?

Perhaps the best way to escape "cave rationality" is to engage Jesus as if you were a participant among his original audiences. Jesus uses metaphors constantly—seeds, birds, vineyards, trees, servants and masters—parables that provoke questioning and require a quest. His vision can hardly be called small or mind-closed; in fact, he calls us all out of the cave to see things as they truly are: eternal.

Encountering Jesus always gives the seeker a wider and deeper perspective on God—always, then and now. In his ministry, Jesus engages the predetermined "dungeon rationality" of his time. For example, he says to the traditionalists:
> "You have heard it said … but I tell you"  
> —Matthew 5:17–48

He offers a radically different interpretation that unlocks people from pre-determined thinking. In any circumstance, Jesus always surprises. He speaks in parables and uses life metaphors—not rational codes—to force people to see God in new ways. He appeals to a deeper perception:
> "Whoever has ears, let them hear."  
> —Matthew 11:15

We need to see and hear beyond what is merely heard and said. Jesus calls for a radical openness of the heart, a searching for deeper and truer perceptions of truth.
