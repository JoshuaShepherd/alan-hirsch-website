## Reframing Mission: The Missio Dei

One of the most celebrated missiologists in the world, during his years of service, underwent a series of experiences that transformed him from a bigoted Afrikaner to a deeply compassionate missionary in a poor black community in the Transkei region of South Africa. Exhausted from the back-breaking labors of working with the poor, he eventually accepted a position in 1975 as professor of missiology at UNISA (University of South Africa), Pretoria, where he served until his untimely death in a car accident in 1992.

What he discovered about the mission of Jesus can be summed up as follows:

> Mission is understood as being derived from the very nature of God. It is thus placed in the context of the doctrine of the Trinity, not primarily of ecclesiology or soteriology. The classical doctrine of the missio Dei—God the Father sending the Son, and God the Father and the Son sending the Spirit—is expanded to include yet another movement: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit sending the church into the world.

When we see God as Jesus understood Him, we see a God so devoted to His broken planet that He issues Himself forth to redeem it. In the incarnation of Jesus, we hear the missio Dei presented in His teaching and embodied in His flesh. Further, the ministry of the Spirit continues to testify to God’s character and His core missional orientation. As Jacques Matthey notes:

> "We have not separated the Father from the Son and the Spirit. This has consequences: we cannot limit the scope of Christ or the Spirit to inner-church circles."

In effect, the Trinity cannot be confined within the church. God—the Father, Son, and Spirit—escapes the stained-glass crypt and sends Himself throughout the world.

### The Role of the Church in Missio Dei

This does not mean the church is excluded; on the contrary, as Bosch pointed out, the cycle continues with the triune God sending the church into the world. It is essential that we recapture the church’s role within the overall framework of missio Dei, without reverting to an old ecclesiocentric approach.

Nonetheless, to "reJesus" the church will involve dismantling its much-loved temple theology. While Jesus embodies the fact that the Trinity is both sent and sending, His followers often prefer a deity who reveals Himself only in sacred buildings, liturgies, and sacramental practices. Temple theology locates God as a withdrawn deity, calling recalcitrants back to His temple or church. But an encounter with the Jesus of the Gospels overturns this idea.

Though Jesus reveres the Jerusalem temple as "my Father’s house" (Luke 2:49), He never claims that His Father lives in that building. Rather, within the Jewish system of His time, the temple was seen as a physical embodiment of God’s presence in Israel. Jesus equates His own person as such an embodiment when He says, "I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days" (Matthew 26:61). He refers to His own body and its impending death and resurrection—not merely as a prediction of resurrection, but as a statement about where God's physical presence is located. Jesus is the temple, the physical embodiment of God. Through Jesus’ death, God’s dwelling place is now among those who serve Him.

## We Will See the Church Differently

Through Jesus’ eyes, the church is the sent people of God. A church is not a building or an organization, but an organic collective of believers—the body of Christ—centered on Jesus and sent into the world to serve others in His name. When captivated by the Nazarene carpenter, we can no longer see ourselves as participants in the same system Jesus came to subvert.

Jesus undermines temple theology by becoming the temple Himself, and He undermines the sacrificial system by dispensing with sin without reference to ceremonial washings, rituals, or liturgies ("Go in peace, your sins are forgiven"). He also defies the legalism of Sabbath keeping, subverting the whole religious system. Why would Jesus do all that simply to replace it with a Christian religious system? He does not. He offers His followers direct access to the Father, forgiveness in His name, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

To be "reJesused" is to recognize that the church, as the New Testament defines it, is not a religious institution but a dynamic community of believers participating in the way and work of Jesus.

As Ann Morisy observes:

> "The church, if it is to honor the Gospel, has to journey out, embrace strangers, work for social peace and justice, and partake of God’s gracious gift of salvation."

God’s mission is His and His alone; the glory of God, not the church, is the ultimate goal of mission. We do not determine our own agenda nor merely imitate Him, but participate in the marvelous plan of God according to His call and guidance. Bosch eloquently states:

> Mission takes place where the church, in its total involvement with the world, bears its testimony in the form of a servant, with reference to unbelief, exploitation, discrimination and violence, but also with reference to salvation, healing, liberation, reconciliation and righteousness... Looked at from this perspective, mission is, quite simply, the participation of Christians in the liberating mission of Jesus, wagering on a future that verifiable experience seems to belie. It is the good news of God’s love, incarnated in the witness of a community, for the sake of the world.

### Participation and Identity: _Participati Christi_

Participation in Christ’s liberating mission—_participati Christi_—is fundamental. Lynn Cohick, in her commentary on Philippians, writes:

> "...being 'in Christ' involves union, participation, identification, and incorporation into Christ’s life. These terms capture the multifaceted redemption brought by Christ."

To be redeemed necessarily involves participation in Christ’s work. Bosch warns against reductionism: mission is not merely evangelism or social justice; it is everything Jesus is about in the world.

Tish Harrison Warren, in _Liturgy of the Ordinary_, beautifully captures this idea:

> "A sign hangs on the wall in a New Monastic Christian community house: 'Everyone wants a revolution. No one wants to do the dishes.'... you can’t get to the revolution without learning to do the dishes. The kind of spiritual life and disciplines needed to sustain the Christian life are quiet, repetitive, and ordinary... it’s in the dailiness of the Christian faith—the making the bed, the doing the dishes...that God’s transformation takes root and grows."

### The Inclusiveness of Jesus' Mission

In Luke 9:49-50, the disciple John notifies Jesus of a stranger performing exorcisms in His name. Jesus replies, "Do not stop him; for whoever is not against you is for you." Rather than drawing lines of demarcation between insiders and outsiders, Jesus calls us to bless all who participate in His work. The kingdom cannot be contained within borders; it is living, wild, and bursting out everywhere.

One of the church's greatest mistakes is to equate itself with the kingdom of God. The kingdom is broader than the church—it is both ordinary and cosmic in scope. The church is the primary agent of the kingdom but must not be equated fully with it. We must see kingdom activity wherever it expresses itself and join with God in it.

Jesus tells the parable of the wheat and tares (Matt 13:24–30) to illustrate that separation of true and false is God’s job, not ours. We are to tend to the wheat and participate in the kingdom’s growth, leaving the business of weeding to God and His angels.

### The Communal Commitment: _Corpus Christi_ and _Ecclesia_

This participation is not a solo pursuit. The doctrine of _corpus Christi_ (the body of Christ) calls together bodies of believers for His mission. Interestingly, the term _ecclesia_, used by Jesus and Paul to describe a gathering of Christians, was not originally religious. In ancient usage, _ecclesia_ referred to a community of elders who met to deliberate on social and political matters for the common good. 

Paul adapted this term for his fledgling communities, emphasizing unity, diversity (1 Cor 12:12–31), familial devotion (Gal 6:9–11), holiness (Eph 5:22–32), and discipline (Eph 6:10–13). The Christian _ecclesia_ was to be a body that added value and wisdom to its community, binding its destiny to that of the village in which it resided.

To be the sent people of God means having our neighborhood’s best interests at heart, sent by Jesus to add value, bring wisdom, and foster a better community—in short, to participate in Christ's work all around us.

## We Will See the World Differently

We recognize that each person is created in the image of God (_imago Dei_) and possesses inherent dignity and value. God is at work within each individual, leading them on a unique and sacred journey.

_Preveient grace_ affirms that God goes before us, preparing our participation in His work and leaving His mark—His fingerprints—on every soul.

To be made in the image of God acknowledges the unique, special qualities of human nature that allow God to manifest Himself in us. While the doctrine recognizes humanity's sinfulness, it asserts that God's image cannot be erased, and through us, God's plans and purposes are known.

Jesus powerfully illustrates this in the parable of the sheep and the goats (Matt 25:31–46). The repeated refrain—"whatever you did/do not do for the least of these, you did/do not do for me"—underscores the _imago Dei_ in every person. Jesus modeled recognizing and affirming God's image, even among the most unlikely—foreigners, criminals, lepers, adulteresses, Samaritans, the marginalized.

If we "reJesus" the church, we will lead it towards greater respect, grace, and love for those outside its walls, recognizing the image of God in all.

### Parable of Mission: "Death Comes for the Archbishop"

Willa Cather’s _Death Comes for the Archbishop_ provides a vivid illustration of this missional perspective. Father Vaillant, a missionary priest, describes discovering buried Mass vessels hidden by a Pima Indian family for generations:

> "Down near Tucson, a Pima Indian convert once asked me to go off into the desert with him... We descended into a terrifying canyon, and there in a cave, he showed me a golden chalice, vestments and cruets... His ancestors had hidden these sacred objects when the mission was sacked by Apaches, he did not know how many generations ago. The secret had been handed down and I was the first priest to restore them to God. To me, that is the situation in a parable. The Faith, in that wild frontier, is like a buried treasure; they guard it, but do not know how to use it to their soul’s salvation. A word, a prayer, a service is all that is needed to free these souls in bondage. I confess I am covetous of that mission."

The church's role is not to bring God to others, but to unearth the gospel, the _imago Dei_, already buried in every soul.

## Marked by Jesus

To be "reJesused," one must be committed to being marked by Jesus—shaped and changed to reflect His life and teaching. Flannery O’Connor's story, "Parker’s Back," illustrates this vividly.

Obadiah Elihue Parker, a rootless laborer, has tattooed his body with countless images—except for his back. Wanting to please his fundamentalist, disapproving wife, he seeks the ultimate tattoo: an icon of Christ on his back. As O’Connor describes, Parker is moved by the image of Jesus and has it inscribed on himself—an act symbolizing being marked, and transformed, by the face of Christ.

Ironically, his religious wife cannot recognize Jesus: "It ain’t nobody I know," she says. Parker, bruised and battered by her rejection, stands as an embodiment of the suffering servant, marked by Christ, misunderstood yet finally true to his calling. 

As disciples, our calling is the same: to be marked by Jesus and see God, the church, and the world differently.

> Let us see Your hand at work, even in small and obscure places, so that we might join You.
>
> Teach us again about our calling as a sent people,
> Drive us outward into the lives of those You love and toil amongst,
> Empower us by Your Holy Spirit to be agents of reconciliation, justice, and love,
> And give us eyes to see the image of God the Father in everyone we meet.  
> Amen.

## ReJesus and Personal Renewal

Rainn Wilson, actor and cultural commentator, brought this perspective into sharp relief:

> "The metamorphosis of Jesus Christ from a humble servant of the abject poor to a symbol that stands for gun rights, prosperity theology, antiscience, limited government (that neglects the destitute) and fierce nationalism is truly the strangest transformation in human history."

Wilson’s comment forces us to reflect: How do we read the Gospels and arrive at a Jesus who supports greed, nationalism, or violence? The church’s lack of discipleship may be its single biggest flaw in the West. Far too often, church life excludes active discipleship in favor of cultural Christianity.

### The Meaning and Cost of Discipleship

At its core, discipleship means allowing Jesus to live in and through us. It is a life modeled on His—"doing the same kind of things Jesus did for the same kind of reasons." Discipleship is how Jesus becomes real in His church.

Discipleship is not simply about believing certain things about Jesus; it is about actively following and imitating Him. The loss of this focus explains much of the spiritual bankruptcy in Western Christianity.

### Renewal: Returning to Jesus

When the church gets stuck or loses its way, it must recover its primal identity in the person of Jesus. Christology (our understanding of Jesus) must drive our mission (missiology), which in turn shapes our forms and expressions of community (ecclesiology). No church renewal project can succeed unless it is anchored in biblical Christology.

Wilhelm Visser ’t Hooft notes:

> "It belongs to the very life of the people of God that it must accept again and again to have its life renewed by a new confrontation with its Lord and his holy will."

Recalibrating or "rebooting" to Jesus revitalizes the mission and community of the church.

## The Capturing of Our Imaginations

Our imaginations are shaped—often controlled—by powerful forces: media, entertainment, consumer culture. Like previous empires, modern society seeks to capture our imaginations and secure our allegiance. Early Christians confronted Roman imperial imagery by reorienting themselves around Christ.

Brian Walsh and Sylvia Keesmaat, commenting on Colossians, observe:

> "Economic growth is the driving force of history, consumer choice is what makes us human, and greed is normal. If we live in an empire, it is an empire of global consumerism."

Into this world steps Jesus, offering an alternative imagination. The "WWJD?"—What Would Jesus Do?—question must move beyond personal piety to the pressing issues of economics, the environment, and politics.

> "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" (Matt 6:21).

If our imaginations are captured by Jesus, our actions and priorities will follow.

## The Conspiracy of Little Jesuses

David Bosch writes:

> "Discipleship is determined by the relation to Christ himself, not by mere conformity to impersonal commands."

Mission flows not out of obligation, but out of devotion and participation in Christ. The Great Commission is not a remote order; it is a creative statement about the new reality inaugurated in Jesus.

Dallas Willard laments:

> "Churches in the Western world have not made discipleship a condition of being a Christian. One is not required to be, or to intend to be, a disciple in order to become a Christian, and one may remain a Christian without any signs of progress toward or in discipleship."

To avoid a Christianity without Christ, we must focus on making disciples who embody and transmit the gospel in both word and deed.

Jacques Ellul reinforces the cohesion of life and witness:

> "No recognizable revelation exists apart from the life and witness of those who bear it. The life of Christians is what gives testimony to God and to the meaning of this revelation... If Christians are not conformed in their lives to their truth, there is [effectively] no truth."

---

## Face Time with Jesus: The Practice of Conformation

Christianity has always grappled with the challenge of embodying the faith. The New Testament understands discipleship not as information transfer or programmatic activity, but as conformation—being shaped into the image of Jesus (see Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote:

> "It comes only as formation into his likeness, as conformation with the unique form of Him who was made man, was crucified, and rose again."

Conformation is not abstract theologizing or program development, but tangible obedience and transformation. The pattern to be imitated is none other than Jesus, the model of true humanity.

## Conclusion

To "reJesus" the church and our lives is to return, again and again, to Jesus as our center—the source, Lord, and shaper of our mission, community, and spirituality. It calls us to see God, the church, and the world through the lens of Jesus; to embody His image; and to participate in His mission—marked by grace, justice, and love.
