# Not Your Own Personal Jesus

> Monotheism is an outcome of the exclusive claim of Yahweh, rather than a conceptual hypothesis resulting from human effort to gain a unitary view of his world.  
> — Paul Minear

> Joshua ben Korba said: Why does the section “Hear, O Israel” (Deut 6:4–9) precede the section “And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently to my commandments”? So that a man may first take upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven and afterward take upon him the yoke of the commandments.  
> — *The Talmud*

In the seventeenth chapter of the Book of Judges, we meet a man named Micah from Ephraim. His mother, a God-fearing Israelite matriarch, is shocked to discover that twenty-eight pounds (about thirteen kilograms) of silver has been stolen from her household. Outraged, she calls down a curse upon the unknown thief. Given what happens later, it probably isn’t Yahweh she prays to. For all we know, she might have invoked some kind of ancient Canaanite death curse.

But it has the desired effect. Her own son, Micah, owns up to the ruse and sheepishly repays the silver. To express her gratitude to Yahweh (or some other god), she takes a portion of the returned silver and has it melted down and turned into an idol, which she installs in Micah’s place in the hill country of Ephraim.

Perhaps grateful that he hadn’t fallen victim to some Canaanite death god, Micah decides on an unusual course of action: he starts a whole new religion! Micah sets up a private shrine in his house, where he worships idols, wears a priestly ephod of his own making, and even installs one of his sons as his household priest.

Things escalate when a wandering Levite arrives in the hill country and seeks refuge at Micah’s house of worship. Levites were the priestly tribe of Israel. Their forefathers were the enforcers of proper worship and had once hacked idol-worshiping Israelites to pieces! You might expect that an itinerant Levite wouldn’t take kindly to Micah’s idol worship. But Micah is shameless to the core. He happily shows the Levite his collection of silver gods and even offers his visitor a job, inviting him to be the high priest of Micah’s new homegrown religion:

> “Live with me and be my father and priest, and I’ll give you ten shekels of silver a year, your clothes and your food.”  
> — Judges 17:10

Surprisingly, the wandering Levite thinks it sounds like a great idea and agrees. Micah is quite pleased with the arrangement. Despite being a thief, a liar, and an idolater, he figures that having his own personal Levite will keep him in good stead with Yahweh.

Paying your own personal Levite isn’t that different from the practice of Medieval European kings who paid their own priests to officiate at an altar in specially consecrated rooms in their castles. Often, these castle chapels were located near the gate or in the upper story of the gate tower, to claim God’s protection over the most vulnerable point in the castle.

Having your own personal priest sounds a lot like that old Depeche Mode song, "Personal Jesus." You might also have heard Johnny Cash’s cover version, which he recorded very late in his life. In his aged growl, he sings about needing his own personal Jesus, someone who will especially be available to him, to hear his prayers and look after him. The song was originally written as a critique of televangelist strategies, in which donors were encouraged to make phone calls and reach out their hands to the television screen to have their prayers met.

Whether it’s Micah’s pampered Levite (who later gets traded up to a bigger job with the Danites), a Teutonic castle priest, or a contemporary televangelist, they’re all offering the same thing: convenient, personalized religion. You get God’s protection for a minimum of fuss. Your own personal Jesus, tucked away in the corner.

This attitude seems to describe much of contemporary Christianity. Jesus doesn’t lay claim to the totality of a believer’s life; he just blesses their current behavior and offers protection in the life to come. Oh, and he’s useful for finding you a spot in a crowded parking lot.

Instead, we want to frame any discussion about Jesus within the most fundamental revelation of God in the Bible. We are going to look at biblical monotheism and its implications for a missional worldview, as well as some of its practical applications for life and faith.

Monotheism, interpreted from within the biblical worldview, is the belief that the one God, Lord and Creator of all, has rightful claim to sovereignty over all that he has created. Viewed this way, Jesus’ teachings on the kingdom of God are one way of expressing the claim of the one God over all creation. He’s not your own personal Jesus — he is the King of the universe, and he asks for your total allegiance.

# One God

The key biblical text on this topic is what Jewish people call the Shema:

> “Hear, O Israel: The LORD is our God, the LORD alone. You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.”  
> — Deuteronomy 6:4–5

As a righteous Jew, Jesus himself affirms that there are no greater commandments than these (Mark 12:31). The word shema is the first word in the text of Deuteronomy 6:4–9, and it means “hear” or “pay attention” to what follows. What follows is more than simply a statement about God and his relationship to the people of God; it contains the fundamentals of the biblical worldview because it ties together a distinct way of ethical living with a distinct understanding of God.

The Shema also assumes the whole idea of a covenant relationship between the players — a deeply personal and well-defined connection between God and the people of Israel. This text is of particular importance because it contains the guiding idea of God that is basic to Jewish faith and is assumed by all the writers of the New Testament.

This concept of the oneness of God represents a striking contrast to the cultures that surrounded Israel, where the multiplicity of gods led to great upheaval and tension in human life. Though a polytheist might carry out their religious duties with care, they could not be guaranteed any security, for if there was strife among the gods, this would radically affect human life. One god might promise much to the individual person, but a more powerful god might still bring disaster. The resulting tension often led to a deep pessimism in religious life and thought.

This is not as theoretical as it may sound. The average modern polytheist-next-door also lacks an integrating center of life. They live under the rules of economics, nationalism, sex, family — and whatever other idols they set up. These are idols that can dominate a person’s life and consciousness. History is clear: people will kill for these, if necessary. These idols compete with one another and demand loyalty and obeisance, but they can never deliver ultimate meaning to life.

In radical contrast, Yahweh is the one and only God who redeems his people and subsequently requires that they love him as he has already loved them. The form this love of God takes is made known to us in Scripture, nature, and history. He is good, holy, just, and compassionate, and he requires us to be the same. To be in relationship with him brings meaning, focus, moral vision, and ultimate reality to human life.

This revelation of “God as One” speaks not only of the uniqueness of God (over against the many) but also the unity within God and therefore the world God has created. The God of the universe is the God of history. This understanding of God lies at the root of the whole biblical worldview. It is clear that it motivates and inspires the faith of the New Testament.

Monotheistic statements permeate the New Testament, whether they are statements of faith in the one God, the only God, or the God from whom all things derive. These affirmations demonstrate a complete continuity with the Old Testament and its fundamental proclamation of existential (Deut 5:7) and theoretical (Deut 4:35) monotheism.

But this concern with monotheism is especially present in the teachings of Jesus, where he places strong emphasis on the affirmation of one God. In Mark 12:28–34, Jesus responds to a question about the greatest commandment by directly quoting the Shema (Deut 6:4–5), thus affirming the primacy of monotheistic faith. Yet the fullness of this quotation, with its emphasis on total devotion to God, and the addition of a “second like it” (the loving of one’s neighbors as oneself), draws out the ethical consequence of faith that is so distinctly rooted in the Shema.

In Mark 10:18–19, this same idea is stressed. The affirmation of God’s unique goodness (“No one is good but God alone”) is immediately followed by a list of ethical imperatives that derive from the uniquely good God. The monotheistic confession was thus taken seriously by Jesus, not because there was a pervasive rational challenge to it, but because its ethical implications were so serious. Dedication to the one God, according to Jesus, must be demonstrated by living out God’s ethical demands.

This connection between belief in the one God and the way of life of the believer has been given the rather unappealing label “ethical monotheism.” We prefer, for reasons that will become obvious, to call it “existential monotheism.” This term refers to the notion that genuine relationship with the biblical God must result in a lifestyle consistent with the nature of the covenant God.

So, the Shema is not so much a statement about the unity and oneness of God as it is a statement about the relationship that God has with Israel and the church. Existential monotheism has implications for the whole spirituality of the people born of this revelation. Therefore, discipleship, worship, and mission must take a direct cue from the claim of the one Lord over our lives. This has far-reaching consequences for us, as it also implies the obliteration of all the life-cramping dualisms (e.g., sacred and secular, body and spirit) that have plagued Christian thinking in the Western tradition.

> **Existential Monotheism Diagram:**  
> *One God → redemptive claim → our response*  
> The diagram illustrates the unifying and all-encompassing nature of the claim that God makes over the lives of his chosen people. Everything is caught up into the redemptive lordship of the One. We prefer the term existential to ethical because we think it best describes the dynamics of biblical monotheism, not so much as a philosophy or doctrine, but as the impact that an encounter with the One God has on the whole lives of those who truly meet him.

# One Love

Monotheism, as the biblical players experienced it, was a response to an encounter with the living God. There is a clear, direct, and indissoluble link between God and the lifestyles that ought to emerge from an encounter with God. But biblical faith in God moves us beyond mere ethics and intellectual knowledge of God to something far more impactful and all-embracing. The whole of life is caught up, focused, and directed in the God encounter.

To attempt to avoid this far-reaching claim that God makes on our lives is to miss a truly godly experience. There is a gulf of difference between this existential view of monotheism and the philosophical one. The philosopher poses the question of the nature of God in a form quite alien to the outlook of the biblical writers. The philosopher makes the problem one of intellect rather than of action; he or she views the problem speculatively, seeking objective understanding of a concept of God rather than existentially to grow in personal involvement with God.

To those who claim the name of Jesus, only one power is sovereign — the God we encounter in the Lord Jesus Christ. And we are called to respond with our lives. Yale University theologian Paul Minear explains:

> "Christian belief does not consist in saying 'there is one God.' The devil knows that! Christians respond to their God by faith in his deeds, by trusting in his power, hoping in his promise, and passionately abandoning themselves to do his will. Only within the context of such a passionate vocation does the knowledge of the one Lord live. And this knowledge necessitates rather than eliminates the struggle with the devil and all his works. To paraphrase Kierkegaard, only in unconditional obedience, spurred by infinite passion, infinite resignation, infinite enthusiasm, is such 'monotheism' wholly manifested in human existence, as for example, in Jesus."

# Seek First the Kingdom

Beyond the defining encounter with the One who claims us, the existential approach gets us much closer to what the Bible teaches about discipleship and genuine belief in God. All these aspects come into clearer focus in Jesus’ teaching on the kingdom of God.

Viewed from the angle of existential monotheism, the kingdom of God can be seen as "the business, or working, end" of the claim of the One God over all of life. The New Testament writers’ use of the phrase "the kingdom of God" is another way of saying that God is One, that he is King, and that he claims all and rules over all.

Many miss this because we don’t understand monotheism the way first-century Jews did. While there might be a difference of opinion over Jesus’ use of this phrase, most scholars agree that the kingdom of God refers to the active reign of God everywhere and over everyone. It is the activity of God in all spheres of life, especially in the church, but also well beyond it.

Eugene Peterson captures it well:

> "The 'political' metaphor, 'Kingdom,' insists on a gospel that includes everything and everyone under the rule of God. God is no religious glow to warm a dark night. Christ is no esoteric truth with which to form a Gnostic elite. The Christian faith is an out-in-the-open, strenuous, legislating, conquering totality. God is sovereign: nothing and no one is exempt from his rule."

The concepts of monotheism and the kingdom of God are intertwined. The earliest Christians expressed this by restating Israel’s ancient belief in the kingdom of Yahweh and recognizing the lordship of Jesus. This lordship is expressed as the covenant claim of God over our lives, the unshakable center of the Christian creed and confession.

> **Kingdom Diagram:**  
> *redemptive claim → the active reign of God in Jesus (the kingdom) → our response*  
> *JESUS IS LORD/KING*

The kingdom of God is the arena in which God exercises his sovereign rule over his world; all is included (and therefore nothing is excluded) in this claim. Once again, the all-encompassing nature of existential monotheism comes to the fore.

# The Loss of the Holy Other

Cultural commentator Mark Sayers suggests that while most people in Western contexts say they believe in some form of god, the god they believe in is so distant and their idea so vague that it fails to generate any transforming impact. Sayers calls this the “break-glass-in-case-of-emergency-god,” the being invoked when trouble or disaster strikes. But this god is so remote as to have no practical impact on daily life at all.

In other words, popular ideas of god — whether in new religious movements or vague notions of a higher power — fail to engender a way of life as response: an ethic, an ethos, a Way. This lack of engagement with God creates a vacuum; other things rush in to fill the gap.

In our day, consumerism is the chief idol: the provider of meaning, identity, community, and purpose. The spiritual quest for happiness (the good life) is mainly pursued through the blessings of consumption. Sayers thus rightly notes that consumerism provides us with a definite form of spirituality.

The practical irrelevance of the deity has another significant consequence: the deification of the self. With the loss of the holy Other, the self becomes the sole source of authority and thus the only real basis of ethics, guidance, and choices. When this happens, we become trapped in a vacuous prison of pleasure, under the mercies of marketers. The god of mammon rears its ugly head again.

# Consumerism as Spirituality

Christians are not exempt from the trivialization of God and resultant deification of the self. An independent observer could reasonably believe that Western Christianity is consumerist to its core. But any diminishing of the claims of the one true God, and any deification of the self, is nothing more than another form of religious idolatry.

Recall the various images that Christians entertain of Jesus: bearded-lady Jesus, spooky Jesus, or the "Iddy-Baby Jesus" of *Talladega Nights*. There is also “Buddy Jesus” from the film *Dogma*: Jesus as your pal or mate, lacking reverence and characterized by bland familiarity. If our primary image of Jesus is that he is merely our homeboy, our buddy, then we shouldn’t be surprised if the religion that develops around this is a false and profoundly consumerist one.

> "OUR ULTIMATE CONCERN  
> redemptive claim → One God  
> redemptive claim → many gods"

Monotheistic faith calls forth a response involving the whole person. It asks: What is the treasure of my heart to which I owe allegiance? Martin Luther observed that the very word "God," understood rightly, demands ultimate allegiance.

Inherent in the human condition is a strong impulse to false worship. The claim of the one true God stands against the competing claims of many false gods. Only the true God can give unity, wholeness, and security to a human being. Yet, we resist the all-encompassing claim and seek refuge in false gods.

In Paul Tillich’s existential theology, monotheism is about our ultimate concern. God, the one and only God, is the only possible object of our ultimate concern, since only the one God is ultimate. Without living monotheistic faith, life will inevitably be fragmentary. To paraphrase Yeats: things fall apart; the center does not hold.

Idolatry is insidious. It plays upon our deepest insecurities, appeals to our fearfulness, and nourishes our fallen instinct to flee from the holy One whose love redeems and transforms. For the person of faith, idolatry is a constant temptation. A relationship with God raises countless questions about life, values, money, sexuality, and more. The presence of God creates a holy tension, an awe awakened by contact with the Divine.

> "God is not a problem to be solved; he creates problems through his nearness, his threats, his insistent demands, his irresistible intention. It is not so much that we raise questions about him, than that he raises questions of us."

To encounter Jesus is to be changed by him and to embark on a lifelong journey to become like him. But to become a little Jesus requires moral and spiritual effort, as well as active dependence on the sanctifying Spirit. The attempt to escape the claims of Jesus is common to all of us.

Paul Tillich writes:

> "[A person] who has never tried to escape God never has experienced God, namely, that God who is really God. A god from whom one can successfully flee is proved by that very success to be an idol. God is inescapable. He is God because he is inescapable."

To believe that Jesus is divine is to choose to make him, and what he stands for, our God. To deny this is to make someone or something else our god and to relegate Jesus to second place in our values. Our only way to God is through the redeeming love of Jesus Christ.

# The Christ-Like God

Any chapter exploring monotheism must look at how Jesus develops our understanding of God. We must ensure that the link between the one God of the Scriptures and Jesus the Messiah is properly understood, as this has massive implications for the focus of our faith.

It is clear from the New Testament that Jesus fundamentally alters our understanding of God and faith. Dennis Kinlaw notes that Jesus "affects every aspect of Christian doctrine and gives distinction to its understanding of God, humanity, sin, salvation, and the eschaton.”

Kinlaw focuses on texts in which Jesus reveals the nature of his eternal and intimate relationship to God, particularly the Father-Son relationship in the Gospel of John. In such passages, Jesus claims to be the same as God and fully claims the attributes and functions of God.

In Mark 10:17–22, the confession of "God alone" is coupled with Jesus’ command to "follow me," suggesting that faith in one God and following Jesus are one and the same (see also Mark 2:7–12). In Matthew 23:9–10, the uniqueness of God ("one Father") is paralleled by the uniqueness of Jesus, the "one Master."

1 Timothy 2:5–6 similarly contrasts one God/one Mediator with the multiplicity of gods and mediators found in Gnostic theology. Alongside the Christology of Colossians and Revelation, it becomes clear that Jesus qualifies the oneness of God but does not violate the essential monotheistic revelation of the Bible.

N. T. Wright says:

> "All the signs are that the earliest Christians came to the startling conclusion that they were under obligation, without ceasing to be Jewish monotheists, to worship Jesus… For Paul, 'there is one God (the Father, from whom are all things and we to him), and one Lord, Jesus Christ (through whom are all things and we through him)' (1 Cor 8:6). This stunning adaptation of the Shema…emphasizing creation and redemption as equally originating in the Father and equally implemented through Jesus, encapsulates, at the earliest stages of Christianity … everything that later generations and centuries would struggle to say about Jesus. From here on, we must say that if Trinitarian theology had not existed, it would be necessary to invent it."

Early Christian thinking about God began not by reflecting on God in the abstract, but by focusing first on Jesus. Albert Nolan writes:

> "By his words and praxis, Jesus himself changed the content of the word 'God.' If we do not allow him to change our image of God, we will not be able to say that he is our Lord and our God. ... To choose him as our God is to make him the source of our information about divinity and to refuse to superimpose upon him our own ideas of divinity. This is the meaning of the traditional assertion that Jesus is the Word of God. ... We cannot deduce anything about Jesus from what we think we know about God; we must deduce everything about God from what we do know about Jesus. ... To say now suddenly that Jesus is divine does not change our understanding of Jesus; it changes our understanding of divinity. ..."

Luther understood this christological reframing of God and its implications for the Christian faith. He insisted that if we want to truly see God, we need only look at Jesus, for in Jesus we have received the fullness of God. As Luther says:

> "The only God we see is the God clothed in the promises of the Gospel."

Or as Jesus says,

> “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father?’”  
> — John 14:9

This redefinition of biblical monotheism around Jesus can be called *Christocentric monotheism* because it realigns our loyalties to God around the person and work of Jesus Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Christian faith pivots on this precise point—it is Jesus who sets Christianity apart from the other two monotheistic faiths, Judaism and Islam. Jesus thus becomes the central point in our relation to God, and it is to him that we must give our allegiance and loyalty. Jesus is Lord! Our loyalty to God must now be mediated via the person of Jesus.

Paul insists that the actual function of lordship, normally associated with the Father, is now passed on to Jesus. God actually saves as well as claims us in Jesus, and this claim demands the response of our very lives.

This was a realization that could not be avoided by the Confessing Church (led by Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer) in Nazi Germany when they developed the Barmen Declaration to counter the heretical claims of the so-called Nazi Christians:

> "Just as Jesus Christ is the pledge of the forgiveness of sins, just so—and with the same earnestness—is he also God’s mighty claim on our whole life; in him we encounter a joyous liberation from the godless claims of this world to free and thankful service to his creatures. We repudiate the false teaching that there are areas of our life in which we do not belong to Jesus Christ but another lord, areas in which we do not need justification and sanctification through him."

Here, the interface between the disciple and God is through the redeeming lordship of Jesus, bringing the discussion into practical focus.

> **Response Diagram:**  
> *One God → redemptive claim → our response*

As in the Shema, all elements of monotheism are present. The link between the one God (monotheism) and lifestyle (ethics) is fully maintained. The difference between Old Testament and New Testament understandings of God is found in the person and work of the Messiah—hence Christocentric monotheism.
