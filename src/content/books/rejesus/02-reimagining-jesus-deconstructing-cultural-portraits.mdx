# Reimagining Jesus: Deconstructing Cultural Portraits

> “Who do you say that I am?”  
> — Jesus (Mark 8:29)

## The Jesus of the Culture Wars

The Christianity of the culture wars, often intent on conquering society, paradoxically presents a nonthreatening view of Jesus. The benign images of "gentle Jesus, meek and mild" often serve as mascots for these cultural skirmishes. The doe-eyed, long-haired Jesus watches appreciatively as his followers seek to dominate culture, reminiscent of comedian Will Ferrell’s character Ricky Bobby’s prayer in *Talladega Nights*:

> "Dear Lord baby Jesus..."

In a comedic grace before a family meal, Ricky Bobby thanks "baby Jesus" for fast food and family, requesting miraculous healing powers, until his wife, Carly, interrupts:

- **Carly:** You know Jesus did grow up. You don’t always have to call him “baby.”
- **Ricky:** I like the Christmas Jesus best and I’m sayin’ grace. When you say grace you can say it to grown-up Jesus, teenage Jesus, bearded Jesus, or whoever you want…  
  _[continues]_ Dear tiny Jesus, with your golden fleece diapers, with your tiny little fat balled-up fists…
- **Chip (yelling):** He was a man! He had a beard.
- **Ricky:** Look, I like the baby Jesus version the best.

Others chime in, each with their own fantasy version of Jesus:

- Jesus in a tuxedo T-shirt ("I like my Jesus to party")
- Jesus as a ninja or as lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd

This farcical scene is a reminder of how easily those unfamiliar with the Gospels can fashion Jesus in their own image.

## Remaking Jesus in Our Own Image

Gentle Jesus is expected to preside—uncritically—over everything from church "fight clubs" to purity balls and competitive preacher machismo. The Christianity of culture wars seems to have perfected a toxic brew of militarism, nationalism, and misogyny, while draining Jesus of his true power.

By contrast, the Christianity of Jesus listens to the biblical record, bravely engaging the unsettling, perplexing, unfamiliar Jesus found there. Throughout history—from the Ku Klux Klan’s racist Jesus to churches’ assorted indulgent, platitudinous, or harmless-manger-Jesuses—Christians have been tempted to construct Jesuses who merely mirror their needs.

Our concern is not that Jesus doesn’t address our deepest longings, but that he can never be limited to them. Sometimes, he challenges and contradicts those very needs.

### The Wildness of Jesus

C. S. Lewis captures this in *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe* when Lucy asks if Aslan is safe:

> “‘Safe?’ said Mr. Beaver ... ‘Who said anything about safe? ʹCourse he isn’t safe. But he’s good. He’s the King, I tell you.’”

Jesus is never “safe” when it comes to our culturally adopted lifestyles—but he is always good. His words include both tenderness ("I have desired to gather your children together...," Luke 13:34) and frustration ("Do you not perceive or understand?...," Mark 8:17–18). To limit Jesus to a well of affirmation we tap when needed is to remake him in our image, rather than being shaped into his.

## Iconoclasm: Vandalizing Our Portraits of Jesus

One way to expose our co-option of Jesus is to critically interpret the many images we hold of him. Spanish painter Bartolome Murillo, as a child, vandalized a family icon, transforming a pristine Jesus into a rough-and-ready local boy. As authors, we see ourselves as iconoclasts—holy vandals—defacing cherished but unhelpful images of Jesus.

### Richard-the-Lionheart Jesus

William Holman Hunt’s *The Light of the World* (1850s):

- Jesus stands, robed and crowned, knocking on a door that can only be opened from within.
- His image echoes a mythic English king—more Richard the Lionheart than a Middle Eastern radical.
- Intended to portray kingly grandeur, it co-opts Jesus as serene English royalty, not as the unsettling figure of the Gospels.

### Bearded-Lady Jesus

Warner Sallman’s *Head of Christ* (1940):

- Perhaps the most widely reproduced image of Jesus, showing flowing blond locks, gentle features, and abstract serenity.
- This is an unthreatening Messiah, clean and tidy, fit for sentimental devotion but bearing little resemblance to the provocative, revolutionary Jesus of the Gospels.
- As Alison Morgan notes:
  > “Jesus was a difficult and uncooperative revolutionary who so threatened the established order ... that there seemed to be no option but to have him executed.”

### Spooky Jesus

"Sacred Heart" and other ethereal, highly symbolic images:

- Present Christ as otherworldly, shrouded in halos and auras, humanity overshadowed by divinity.
- These portraits border on docetic heresy, as they portray Jesus as barely contained divinity, rather than as fully human and fully God.
- Early Christian art often erred by overemphasizing divinity, missing the hiddenness, suffering, and vulnerability depicted in the Gospels.

### Secular Liberal Jesus

Contemporary attempts, such as A. N. Wilson’s *Jesus: A Life*, strip away Christian theology to discover a simple Galilean teacher—well-meaning, perhaps radical, but ultimately powerless and ordinary. This Jesus did not intend to found a faith, was executed, and stayed dead; Paul is cast as the true architect of Christianity.

The popularity of Richard Neave’s forensic Galilean, with swarthy skin and short, curly hair, is telling: churchgoers prefer artwork that makes Jesus more attractive or otherworldly. Meanwhile, outside the church, many are drawn to a harmless, liberal Jesus who neither threatens nor restores.

But as Bono points out:

> “No, it’s not farfetched to me. ... Christ says: No. I’m not saying I’m a teacher, don’t call me teacher. ... I’m saying: ‘I’m the Messiah.’ ... So what you’re left with is: either Christ was who He said He was—the Messiah—or a complete nutcase.”

C. S. Lewis first framed this trilemma:

> "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic—on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of Hell ... But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to."

### Revolutionary Jesus

The Gospels portray Jesus as so threatening to religious and political authorities that they plot his death. He is neither harmless nor easily categorized. Pier Paolo Pasolini’s film *The Gospel According to Saint Matthew* presents Jesus as a dark, demanding, subversive reformer, aligning more with the Gospel narrative than sentimental portraits ever could.

Jesus’ aim was not to abolish Israel’s faith but to embody and call people back to its radical heart. His reformation was radical foundationalism, a threat to any system seeking to control him—including the Church today. As Ann Morisy writes in *Journeying Out*:

> "The church, like a chronic alcoholic, has to go through a process of detox, clearing out from the system the toxins that would otherwise bring death. Power has been the poison that ... prevented the institutional church from understanding the gospel."

## What Kind of Man Is This?

Michael once led a worship gathering for people alienated from traditional churches—artists, writers, and cultural creatives. Studying John’s Gospel together, they saw:

- Jesus siding with the oppressed and marginalized
- Acts of inclusion and challenge to exclusion (water into wine, cleansing of the temple)
- A call to transformation not just of the world, but of the heart

To them, the Jesus of bearded-lady and spooky icons was guilt-inducing or inaccessible. The "ordinary Galilean teacher" was safe but ultimately powerless.

## Setting Free the Wild Man

When Jesus famously healed the demoniac on the shores near Gadara (Mark 5), he sought out a reviled, wild, untamable outsider and restored him to humanity—even at economic cost to locals. Jesus then denied the healed man’s request to accompany him, sending him instead as a witness among his own people. Jesus' ministry consistently transgressed boundaries, scandalizing both society and family.

If we are to remake the church in Jesus' image, we must recover this wild, untamed, disturbing, marvelous, powerful God-Man.

## Study Guide Epigraph

> Yours is the voice that God has lent to our silent agony;  
> A voice for the plundered poor, a cry for the outcast,  
> A declaration of support for the silent victims of abuse,  
> A pronouncement of judgment against the profane riches of the world,  
> A raging against humankind’s fierce greed.  
> Trouble our hearts with the things that trouble yours;  
> Your thoughts are not our thoughts; your ways seem shrouded and perplexing,  
> Open our eyes, lift the curtain, reveal your Word to us.  
> We have become accustomed to comfort, and deaf to the cries of your children.  
> Speak your unsettling word to us afresh and rouse us from our silent slumber.  
> Amen.

# How Jesus Changes Everything

> To be fully human is perhaps why I’m Christian, because I see in the life of Jesus a way of being fully human.  
> —Barbara Brown Taylor

> If you want to know who God is, look at Jesus.  
> If you want to know what it means to be human, look at Jesus.  
> If you want to know what love is, look at Jesus.  
> If you want to know what grief is, look at Jesus.  
> And go on looking until you’re not just a spectator, but you’re actually part of the drama which has him as the central character.  
> —N. T. Wright

M. Scott Peck, in *Further Along the Road Less Traveled*, recounts Baptist theologian Harvey Cox’s retelling of Jesus raising Jairus’ daughter (Luke 8). When asked which character they identified with:

- A few chose the desperate woman
- Several hundred identified with Jairus
- The majority chose the perplexed crowd
- Only six identified with Jesus

Peck’s reflection: When only one in a hundred Christians identifies with Jesus, have we made him so divine, so otherworldly, that we cannot connect with him? This, he argues, excuses us from following Jesus closely.

> "But that is exactly what we’re supposed to do! We’re supposed to identify with Jesus, act like Jesus, be like Jesus. That is what Christianity is supposed to be about: the imitation of Christ."  
> —M. Scott Peck

Often, the church presents following Jesus as merely mystical or metaphorical, rather than an embodied imitation. Charles Sheldon’s *In His Steps* challenges Christians to ask: "What would Jesus do?"—but the question is only helpful if we genuinely know Jesus well enough to imagine his response.

## Seeing Through the Eyes of Jesus

A classic psychological experiment asked viewers to watch a basketball game and count passes, while a person in a gorilla suit walked among the players. About half failed to see the gorilla—showing we see what we expect to see.

To "reJesus" is to let Jesus transform how we see God, church, and the world.

### Three Foundational Shifts

1. **Seeing God through the Missio Dei**
2. **Seeing the Church as Participatio Christi**
3. **Seeing the World with the Imago Dei**

#### 1. We Will See God Differently

When our imagination is captivated by Jesus, we see God not as a remote Father, but as integrally involved—a God who sends himself into the world. The *missio Dei* (the mission of God) is not merely an activity, but the character of God’s being.

Jesus hints at this in John 5:

> "My Father is still working, and I also am working." (John 5:17)

He claims total devotion to the Father's mission, and in so doing, challenges us to align our own lives with the sent and sending God. As David Bosch notes, all genuine Christian life is taken up into God’s mission—sharing in what God is doing in the world (see also John 8:29).

Thus, to "reJesus" ourselves and our communities is to be drawn into the wild, unpredictable, missional life of God—unmapped by culture wars or sanitized expectations, but compelling, untamable, and ever-new.
