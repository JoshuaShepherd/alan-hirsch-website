# The Legalism That Silenced the Pharisees

How could we have overlooked Jesus’ words in Luke 6, where, after the Pharisees rebuked his disciples for eating kernels of grain on the Sabbath, he replied:

> “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave some to his companions?”  
> Then he said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”  
> — *Luke 6:3–5*

Jesus locates himself as the center of the Jewish religious life. As we’ve seen, he sees himself as the physical embodiment of the temple—doing what the temple is supposed to do. Now, he proclaims lordship over the Sabbath. It is his day. He was not shifting the focus of Sabbath keeping from Yahweh to himself. He is Yahweh! It was always his day. What he is declaring is lordship over all of life, including the Sabbath.

In Mark’s version of the same episode, Jesus says:

> “The Sabbath was made for humankind, and not humankind for the Sabbath.”  
> — *Mark 2:27*

His point was that the Sabbath was made to serve people, not the other way around. The Sabbath is a servant, not a master. He instructs that the law of the Sabbath should be applied with mercy and with consideration for human need—and he asserts that he has the authority to define how the Sabbath is observed. In short, human need (the disciples’ hunger, the ill man’s dropsy) is more important than blind Sabbath keeping. Jesus sets his friends free to enjoy snacking on the rolled husks of wheat; he attends to a sick man rather than be bound by legalism.

Likewise, the church today must rediscover that while regular times of retreat and reflection are essential, they are tools for us to use as we need. Michael has a friend who works in a downtown office in Sydney who takes his lunch two or three times a week to a nearby cathedral to reflect on Jesus and enjoy the serenity of the place. He is free to sabbath as he wills. Jesus is Lord of all of life, of every day and every place. Hallelujah!

# Jesus’ Community Will Move Outward to Serve Others

Jesus’ community is not a static band of learners. They are a moving, living, breathing, organic team of “little Jesuses.” Rather than setting up camp in Nazareth and downloading a new worldview in theoretical rhetoric, Jesus hits the road with his followers, demonstrating that community is forged by the heat of action and joint cooperation in a cause beyond themselves. They are buffeted by criticism, confused by the reactions of others, and inspired by the example of Jesus.

After he sends them (and fifty-eight others) out in pairs to preach, heal, and drive out demons, they return “with joy” to report on what they have seen (Luke 10:17). They are bound to each other as a band of brothers and sisters. Jesus even takes a tax collector (Levi/Matthew) and a zealot (Simon) into his troupe—no two people would have despised each other more. The political and theological differences that would have normally driven Simon and Matthew apart are overwhelmed by their joint commitment to the mission of Jesus. This is akin to Legolas and Gimli in *The Lord of the Rings*: sworn enemies, yet united in a quest.

While there are occasional or casual observers enjoying the ministry of Jesus—such as at the Sermon on the Mount or the feeding of the thousands—John points out that most people weren’t able to stomach Jesus’ teaching. In John 6, after the feeding of the five thousand, many turned away, offended by his uncompromising instruction (John 6:60, 66). Jesus is unfazed by this; he knows few will faithfully follow him (John 6:64b–65).

Jesus’ community is built not on casual observers, but on those who are fully committed. Listen to Peter’s plaintive cry when Jesus offers him the chance to also turn away:

> “Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words of eternal life.”  
> — *John 6:68*

### Resisting Spectator Christianity

How can churches today resist becoming a spectator sport? How can they fight against the spirit of consumerism? Often, churches seeking to grow end up trying to attract a greater share of the market with advertising ploys and promises of better religious goods and services. For instance, we heard of a church in California that gives away a Harley-Davidson motorbike each year to the person who brings the most visitors to church. Is this how Jesus mobilized his followers—by appealing to greed and self-interest?

Jesus fashioned a community of devoted, selfless servants who sought to model their lives on his selflessness and service. In so doing, they became bound to each other in the bonds of a common cause.

# Jesus’ Community Understands That Worship Encompasses All of Life

Jesus’ community was decidedly missional, defined and shaped by the Founder’s mission to usher in the kingdom of God. The term “missional church” is used widely and means different things to different people, but fundamentally, it refers to communities for whom mission is the organizing principle of all they do and are.

While the church has multiple purposes—worship, discipleship, formation, evangelism, fellowship—missional church people see *mission* as the central and organizing purpose. Rather than seeing worship as central (as most conventional churches do), there is a growing movement seeing worship as richer when organized around mission. Fellowship, discipleship, teaching, and the exercise of gifts also thrive when oriented towards mission.

What is mission? It is the outward impulse of God’s people—not limited to evangelism or social justice, but the Spirit’s propulsion, sending people out to declare Jesus’ lordship in all of life. This sending impulse infuses all of church life.

By contrast, conventional churches that make worship the organizing principle often see evangelism as recruiting new attendees, and fellowship as building up the worshiping community. Missional churches see community built best by those in league with each other in mission. They worship fervently because they see God’s lordship over all, offering all of life back to him.

Someone once told us, “In heaven there’ll be no mission, only worship.” We disagree. In the world to come, we will still be charged with declaring Jesus’ rule over all of life—worshiping as we offer our world back to God.

We never see Jesus’ community at worship in the conventional sense—singing songs in a corporate gathering—but they are always on mission. Their worship happens as they go, and they put corporate worship at the service of mission. We do well to learn from Jesus’ example.

# Jesus’ Community Practices the Presence of Jesus

If mission is the organizing principle for Jesus’ community, does that mean there is no place for private, silent, reflective worship and prayer? Far from it.

Jesus commends this practice:

> “And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.”  
> — *Matthew 6:5–6*

Personal prayer, solitude, and retreat are intrinsic to Jesus’ community. Jesus models this devotional life:

> “In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed.”  
> — *Mark 1:35*

Even at his lowest point, in Gethsemane, Jesus withdraws to pray. He prefers prayer as an intense and private connection with the Father.

Regarding fasting: It was noted that Jesus’ disciples did not fast as John the Baptist’s did. Jesus replied:

> “The wedding guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.”  
> — *Matthew 9:14–15*

For Jesus, his presence was a time for celebration, not fasting. He acknowledges fasting will come with his absence, but after his resurrection, he is returned and remains with the church. This is still the hour for feasting. There seems to be no direct injunction for Christians to fast, though it may be beneficial for spiritual discipline. Again, Jesus cautions against showiness:

> “When you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites.”  
> — *Matthew 6:16–18*

# Jesus’ Community Insists We Must Be Continually Re-Evangelized

The default state of many Christians—trying to earn their salvation by good works and church service—must be resisted. Followers of Jesus need to be “re-gospeled” regularly. Perhaps this is why Jesus told his disciples to remember his sacrificial death in the eating of the communion meal—connecting the gospel to an everyday occurrence like eating, much as the Shema unified all of life for Israel.

The Lord’s Supper was not intended as a peculiar liturgical rite, but a daily reminder of the freedom that comes through Jesus’ death, whenever believers break bread or drink wine. Paul’s instructions to the Corinthians about meals are not about institutionalizing a Christian rite, but about reminding believers of the gospel that should undergird their gatherings.

Churches today must never lose sight of the essential work of the cross and celebrate it as often as they meet. It is not pietism or personal devotion that sets us free, but the unconditional love of Jesus shown in his death.

# Jesus’ Community Learns and Lives the Values of Jesus

For many suburban, middle-class churches, “niceness” has become the supreme expression of discipleship. But the Gospels remind us: Jesus wasn’t merely “nice.” He was good, loving, and compassionate, but not always nice. The church must abandon good-manners piety and adopt the radical kingdom values taught by Jesus—which were so unconventional that they landed Jesus and his followers in trouble more than once.

## Some Core Kingdom Values

- **Meekness** (*Matthew 5:5*)
- **Mercy** (*Luke 15:4–10*)
- **Peacemaking** (*Matthew 5:9*)
- **Sexual propriety in marriage** (*Matthew 5:27*)
- **Unanxious reliance on God’s provision** (*Matthew 6:24–34*)
- **Love of enemies** (*Luke 6:27–30*)
- **Forgiveness toward those who wrong you** (*Luke 6:31–36*)
- **Reconciliation** (*Matthew 5:21–36*)
- **Truthfulness** (*Matthew 5:37*)

When Paul calls for a holy community—"without spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind...holy and blameless" (*Ephesians 5:26–27*)—he refers not to our behavior, but to the salvific work of Jesus. We cannot earn Jesus’ love by niceness; it is freely offered. Thus free, we embrace kingdom values, liberated from neurotic attempts to win divine favor.

It is these values that distinguish Jesus’ followers from the wider culture. Rodney Stark, chronicler of Christianity’s rise, observed:

> "The simple phrase, 'For God so loved the world...' would have puzzled an educated pagan. The notion that the gods care how we treat one another would have been dismissed as patently absurd.... Christianity taught that mercy is one of the primary virtues—that a merciful God requires humans to be merciful. This was revolutionary stuff..."

Christianity fostered a culture without ethnicity, welcomed all, and promoted liberating social relations—granting nothing less than restored humanity.

# Jesus’ Community Devotes Itself to Scripture and the Exercise of Spiritual Gifts

Paul writes:

> "No one ever hates his own body, but he nourishes and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church, because we are members of his body."  
> — *Ephesians 5:29–30*

Thus, Jesus nourishes and cherishes his people across the ages. Today, he does this through the spiritual gifts given to the church—so that, through the Holy Spirit’s ministry, we are built up and cared for. The Jesus who indwells us uses us to serve and care for one another.

In 1 Corinthians 12–14, Paul commends the harmonious expression of all the gifts, likening the church to a unified body. Love (1 Corinthians 13) is essential—without it, differing gifts would create division, not unity.

When Paul describes public gatherings, he writes:

> "When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. … For you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged."  
> — *1 Corinthians 14:26–31*, selected

Here is a church cooperating seamlessly with the Holy Spirit and with each other—each playing their part—nourished by the faith community.

# A Photocopy of a Photocopy of a Photocopy

In the world to come, we will still be charged with the task of declaring Jesus’ rule over all of life. Paul intentionally sought to replicate Jesus’ model—translating the original Jesus community into various global contexts. The difficulty today is that we are often making faded copies of Paul’s copies. Photocopy a document, then copy the copy several times, and the image grows faint.

To recover clarity, we must return to the original. Paul did not ask us to copy his copies, but to use the original as our template. It’s time to "reJesus" our churches so that they more closely resemble the pristine original.

At the start of this book, we visited the great cathedrals of Rome and Moscow and asked: how far has the institution of church moved from the dynamic, relational, countercultural community first forged by Jesus? The eight characteristics just discussed can be lived by any Jesus-following group, without the trappings often considered indispensable.

We do not propose a new ecclesiology. We are not inventing church. We simply call Christians to rediscover Jesus’ teaching, example, and vision. We do so without contempt for tradition, nor presumption of deeper insight. Still, we can hold up today’s professionalized, institutionalized models and ask serious questions about the disjunction with the Gospel’s example. It is time to recalibrate the church around the person of Jesus—not marketing ploys for a shallow, consumeristic age.

> Jesus communities today must never lose sight of the essential work of the cross and celebrate that work as often as they meet together.

Let us pray:

> Show us the riches of our glorious inheritance and the immeasurable greatness of your power. Enable and inspire us to use our spiritual gifts to serve one another, and to fulfill our calling to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything Jesus commanded. Strengthen us to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarrels, and to be gentle toward all people. Give us the strength to reconcile with those with whom we disagree, and grant us a spirit of unity, that we may be one, just as you and the Father are one, so that the world may believe that you truly were sent by God. Amen.

# Conclusion: Tell Me Again

In the conclusion to the first edition of *ReJesus*, we imagined Peter and Paul meeting in an ancient inn. The apostles share the joys and pains of their labors in Asia Minor, remembering difficult churches and personal trials.

Then Paul beseeches Peter,  
> “In case our paths never cross again, can you tell me about him one more time?”

Peter protests,  
> “Oh, Paul, you’ve heard those stories a million times. You tell them better than I do.”

Paul replies,  
> “I’ve been beaten, abandoned, betrayed, shipwrecked, and left for dead... At times it feels so arduous. I long for the Lord as the watchman longs for the end of night. And I wonder whether these small, struggling churches we’re planting will become the movement we dream of. Even after all we’ve seen and done.”  
>  
> [Paul fixes his eyes on Peter.]  
> “Tell me again.”

In the oral culture of the early church, eyewitnesses to Jesus were precious. They “ReJesused” the movement, telling and retelling his miracles, parables, teaching, and the events of his life. This, above all, is the gift we can give our churches: to know and love the accounts of Jesus, and help others do the same.

The gospel is not merely a theory of atonement. It is the proclamation that God has revealed his kingdom and opened it to sinners through Jesus, who will return to consummate the kingdom. We do not cross a bridge to God; God comes to us through Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection. Salvation comes where we are. From Genesis to Revelation, God seeks to dwell with humanity, bridging every divide.

Everything about Jesus points to the kingdom:  
- His birth as fulfillment of God’s promises  
- His miracles as signs of the kingdom’s presence  
- His teaching as an invitation into kingdom life  
- His death as the atoning sacrifice  
- His resurrection as triumphant declaration of his reign

> "Tell me again."

Our churches need reJesusing like never before. Recent high-profile controversies, cultural shifts, and growing disillusionment within the church all point to the need for a fresh look at Jesus. As Richard Rohr says:

> “Christianity is a lifestyle—a way of being in the world that is simple, non-violent, shared, inclusive, and loving. We made it, however, into a formal established religion, in order to avoid the demanding lifestyle itself. One could then be warlike, greedy, racist, selfish, and vain at the highest levels of the church, and still easily believe that Jesus is 'my personal Lord and Savior.' The world has no time for such silliness anymore. The suffering on Earth is too great.”

And large sections of the church are tired of that silliness too. They need reJesusing—but not the sanitized “Kid’s First Bible” version. Many want Jesus as he is: not a convenient emblem or prop, but the challenging, system-toppling, brown-skinned Son of God who ate with outcasts and opposed the proud.

The issue is not just asking “What would Jesus do?” but challenging our sanitized assumptions about him. As Kristin Kobes Du Mez writes in *Jesus and John Wayne*:

> “When evangelicals define themselves in terms of Christ’s atonement or as disciples of a risen Christ, what sort of Jesus are they imagining? Is their savior a conquering warrior... or a sacrificial lamb who offers himself up for the restoration of all things? How one answers these questions will determine what it looks like to follow Jesus.”

Jesus was a good man, but a wild one—a threat to the religious establishment, unfazed by storms or wildness. Even his stories were subversive and mysterious. If your answer to “What would Jesus do?” is that he would be safe, conventional, and indifferent to injustice or poverty, we suspect you didn’t find that answer in the Gospels.

The process of reJesusing the church begins with rediscovery of the fierce, outrageous, true-life story of Jesus. As Michael teaches “Jesus and the Gospels,” students often report meeting Jesus anew—not merely as a figure in doctrine, but as a living person. This should be the work of the church: to give Jesus away for free in all settings and to all generations.

As Sharon Hodde Miller tweeted:

> “From time to time, my kids ask me why we talk about Jesus all the time, and this is what I almost always say: ‘Jesus is the only thing I can give you that can never be taken away.’”

That brings us to tears.

> Jesus is the only thing that can never be taken away.  
>  
> Tell me again.  
>  
> And again and again.
