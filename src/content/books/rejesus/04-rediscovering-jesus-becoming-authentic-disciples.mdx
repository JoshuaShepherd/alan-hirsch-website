# Rediscovering Jesus: Becoming Authentic Disciples

> "God has given us the archetype of what it means to be truly human. Now we must become more authentically human in the way that Jesus has set out for us, using Jesus’ life as a model. It was never meant to be a matter of becoming a religious person but rather the forming of Christ in every person and in the life of the community of disciples."

This concept of conformation draws our focus to the direct link between Jesus and his people. The erosion of this relationship inevitably leads to a decline in the spiritual vitality of the Christian. Conversely, rekindling our connection with Jesus yields spiritual renewal. A true disciple is one who recognizes Christ as a present, lived reality. This is the essence of trusting Jesus: drawing near to him, living under his lordship, trusting in his salvation, and, in an act of worshipful and responsive love, conforming our lives to his.

Participating in the life of God does not come through ecstasy or religious feats of strength, but through Jesus Christ. As one writer expresses:

> "The saints are those who penetrate into the existence of Christ, who lift themselves not by their bootstraps, but by Christ’s humanity into Christ’s divinity."

Kierkegaard, in speaking of this need for immediacy between the believer and Jesus, coined the term *contemporaneousness*. Though cumbersome, it usefully highlights the need for unmediated closeness between Jesus and his followers, where Jesus is seen as a living reality—contemporaneous with every generation. This reality must transcend both time and space.

To be a disciple, then, means a continual, conscious striving to encounter Jesus afresh, beyond inherited presuppositions, and to make the existential personal decision: is Jesus the God-Man who claims our lives, or a madman to be ignored?

## Faith: Beyond Belief in Doctrines

This contemporaneousness is not achieved by simply aligning our theology. Biblical faith cannot be reduced to a set of beliefs, nor can discipleship be seen in these terms. Faith, as Martin Luther rediscovered, is "the supreme gamble in which we stake our lives upon a conviction." It is a profoundly existential act, engaging us fully and personally.

Active presence, not speculation, brings us to contemporary fellowship with Christ. Discipleship is more than initial belief; it is a way of life summed up as "the imitation of Christ." To choose this way is to become his companion, follower, and contemporary. All our acts of worship, prayer, mission, and theology are oriented toward achieving this immediacy.

Christ’s life, in all its aspects, becomes the pattern and the norm for Christians and for the Church.

## The Core Truths: Following the Light of Jesus

> **The Who? And The What?**

What can serve as our light as we travel the path toward Jesus? Foundational truths about Jesus provide the contours of faith and the compass for Christian living. These core truths include:

### 1. Jesus is King

### 9. Jesus Instigates a Countercultural Faith  
*(Matt 21, John 4:20)*  
- True worship is not bound by religious tradition.
- The Church should model Jesus, not just religiosity, and partner in the world's work for justice.

### 10. Jesus Loves the Oppressed  
*(Luke 4:18–19, 7:22–23)*  
- Serving the marginalized may mean opposing oppressive systems.

- We cultivate an urgent expectation for Christ’s return, living each day in light of eternity.

> As Martin Luther wrote:  
> "Live as if Jesus died yesterday, was raised today, and is coming tomorrow."

This list is not exhaustive, but serves as a reminder of the essentials of the faith. The Gospels present Jesus as the most compelling human being—wonderfully human, yet lifting us beyond ourselves and revealing the life of God (John 14:9).

Renewal begins with us. Like a "conspiracy of little Jesuses," it echoes outward, renewing the church.

## ReJesus for the Church and the Organization

> "Jesus, properly understood as shalom, coming into the world from the shalom community of the Trinity, is the intention of God’s once-and-for-all mission. That is, the mission of birthing and restoring shalom to the world is in Christ, by Christ, and for the honor of Christ."  
> — Randy Woodley

> "All religious institutional embeddedness—whether in the form of temple worship, unjust social systems, or repressive religious practices—is challenged by the revelation of God in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus."
> — Gail R. O’Day

### Jesus at the Church's Door

In Revelation 3:20, Jesus says:
> "Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me."

Often misapplied to personal salvation, this verse actually addresses the church at Laodicea—a church that had shut Jesus outside. Each congregation must ask: Is Jesus outside our gathering? Have we so thoroughly domesticated church that we have locked him out?

---

## ReJesusing Our Organizations

The church must regularly return to Jesus for recalibration, to ensure we are truly rooted in him. The Western church, to varying degrees, has lost touch with its founder, diluting the radical message we are meant to live out. Authentic discipleship demands significant congruence with the life and teachings of Jesus.

Some may object, citing the realities of institutional maintenance, but the question persists: Is our practice actually what Jesus intended? Does all our effort serve his mission, or obscure fresh encounter with Jesus?

We affirm that God is present in every tradition and style, but each must undergo the spiritual test of authenticity: Are we measuring ourselves by Jesus’ own life and work?

## Christianity Minus Christ Equals Religion

> Christianity – Christ = Religion

Without Jesus, Christianity becomes a mere institution—rituals, rules, and inherited structures, often devoid of vital spirituality. This phenomenon, called the "routinization of charisma," is not unique to Christianity. Every movement tends to diminish in vitality as the founding impulse fades, replaced by stabilized forms and procedures.

Rituals, creeds, and organizations can aid faith, but unless continually renewed by encounters with God, the life of faith grows stale. The crisis comes when outward forms no longer match inward spiritual reality. Renewal is then essential.

> “[Genuine] religious reality means this: it is the undiminished relation to God Himself. Man does not possess God; he encounters Him.”  
> — Martin Buber

Too often, faith is replaced with preserving souvenirs of spiritual experiences rather than seeking fresh, daily encounters with Jesus.

As Blaise Pascal observed:

> "Christendom is a union of people who, by means of the sacraments, excuse themselves from their duty to love God."

Religion may be used as means to escape the real demands of God, reducing faith to mere intellectualism or conformity. Such reduction always results in the loss of the God-experience.

## Christianity as Antireligion

Reflect on the Pharisees:

- They were sincere, zealous, and meticulous.
- Yet, sincerity and zeal without love, humility, and mercy yield dead, oppressive religion.

Jesus, the true radical, embodied and affirmed theological truth, but always in humble love and mercy. Christianity, as Jacques Ellul puts it, is not "a religion superior to others" but "an antireligion," constantly calling itself to conversion by the absolute revealed in Jesus.

Jesus invalidated mediated religious systems and opened direct access to God for all. His ministry undid religious boundaries—serving the poor, healing the outcast, confronting religious and social powers. His parables and actions consistently challenge any attempt to control God or mediated grace.

In our churches today, we would do well to ask: If the actual Jesus walked in, would we welcome him, or would he disturb us too much?

---

## The Founder and the Found

Movements are defined by the relationship between their founder and their community. Max Weber observed the criticalness of building the founder's charisma into the ongoing life of the organization. As the founding encounter fades, institutionalization takes over, risking stifling the founding vision.

Authentic renewal, Weber argued, requires a return to the charismatic center. For Christianity, this means recurring rediscovery of Jesus—refounding the movement on his life and message.

### Foundational Culture: Three Sources

1. **Beliefs, values, and assumptions of the founders**
2. **Validation through the group’s learning experiences**
3. **Enhancement by new members' contributions**

The founder’s impact is paramount in shaping a movement’s culture. For Christianity, this process of "reJesus-ing" is about rediscovering and reappropriating Jesus’ vision.

---

## Embodiment: The Found Reflecting the Founder

True renewal is more than historical fidelity—it is about *embodiment*, mirroring Jesus’ life within the community. Observers should see authentic signals of Jesus through his people.

Tony Campolo tells the story of Joe, a transformed drunk:
> “Oh God, make me like Joe! ... Is he like Jesus?”

Paul calls believers to imitate as he imitates Christ:
> "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ." (1 Cor 11:1)  
> "Join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us." (Phil 3:17)

Violent, unloving, or oppressive behaviors—and historic atrocities—are incompatible with authentic discipleship. The Founder’s influence must saturate every generation.

---

## Discerning the Inner Voice of the Organization

Steve Addison, drawing from Robert Quinn, emphasizes that organizations have an "inner voice"—their moral core. Renewal means helping members rediscover this voice, not imposing a purpose from without.

Lawrence Cada refers to the "founding charism," a divine grace unique to each organization. Renewal is not blind traditionalism, but an innovative, faithful return to the founder's original vision—radical traditionalism.

### Radical Traditionalism in Practice

Jean Piaget's child development studies reveal:
- Young children follow inherited rules uncritically.
- Adolescents reject the rules, yielding chaos.
- Older children rediscover and own the rules.

The church’s journey echoes this: moving from inherited, uncritical tradition, through crisis or chaos, to a mature, authentic rediscovery of Jesus’ way—the original "rules" now fully owned.

---

## Conclusion

ReJesus, the refounding of the church, calls us to move beyond slavish adherence to inherited rules. It compels us into the creative struggle of rediscovering Jesus afresh for our time—embracing the radical and life-giving way of our Founder, guided always by his words and example.

> Take captive our imaginations,  
> And replicate yourself in us,  
> That we might glorify you in all the world.  
> Amen.
