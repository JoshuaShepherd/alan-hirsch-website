# ReJesus

> “The wheel is come full circle.”
>
> — *William Shakespeare, King Lear*

This quote perfectly describes my feelings as I write this foreword. I first met Alan and Michael in 1995, in Melbourne, as part of the first Arrow Leadership Cohort in Australia. Back then, their passion for Jesus challenged and inspired me—and it continues to do so today, even more profoundly. Over the past twenty-six years, their lives and work have significantly shaped my thinking and practice regarding mission and evangelism.

Throughout the years, I have repeatedly turned to their books, sermons, and social media feeds—along with lengthy conversations with Alan and his wife, Deb—to ensure I had not drifted from the centrality of Christ. If I had, their words would challenge me, recalibrate me, and help ensure that my life and ministry remained informed and shaped by the Jesus of the Gospels, rather than by “cultural” Christianity. Hence, the relevance of that Shakespearean quote.

## A Journey Begun

ReJesus was first published in 2008, the same year my husband, Nick, and I founded A21, a global anti-trafficking organization that works to: 

- Reach the vulnerable
- Rescue the victims
- Restore the survivors

all with the hope of abolishing slavery everywhere, forever. As an evangelist already traveling and speaking in churches around the world, I had the opportunity to raise awareness about human trafficking and rally the church to action. However, I was stunned by the resistance I initially encountered. In church after church, I was asked why I would jeopardize my ministry by getting involved with such an issue. Apparently, it was not “appropriate” to speak about sex trafficking on Sunday mornings. I was encouraged to “stick to preaching the gospel,” as I was obviously gifted for that.

This exposed a fundamental problem: When our Sunday sermon does not impact our Monday practice, something is deeply wrong. When what happens inside the church walls does not lead to transformation outside those walls; when personal comfort is prioritized over addressing discomfort in the world; when singing about freedom and justice is preferred to actually fighting for them; when the gifts of the Spirit are used to entertain the church rather than bring healing and hope to the world—then we have gone off-course. When what I claim to believe about Jesus does not lead me to act in the ways of Jesus, something vital has been lost.

Through years of perseverance and prayer, change came. Eyes, ears, and hearts opened, leading to hands and feet being mobilized to action. Today, A21 has nineteen offices in sixteen countries and tens of thousands of abolitionists fighting to end slavery.

I share this because the message of ReJesus sustained me during times when I wanted to give up. Knowing I was not out of my mind for stepping outside the “Christian bubble” into the purposes of Jesus likely saved my soul from becoming calloused, or from me becoming a “professional” Christian. Again and again, experience has reinforced this for me.

## Encounters That Reshaped Me

When meeting with 500 leaders from the underground church in China, they asked me to teach leadership. They confessed that all they knew was prayer, and their leaders were trained on how to witness to their guards when arrested for execution. Many had been jailed or beaten for their faith. Humbled, I fell to my knees and asked them to pray for me—how could I presume to teach them? I wanted to know Jesus—and be willing to live and die for Him—like my Chinese brothers and sisters.

In Qatar, I witnessed Christians walking for hours in desert heat to churches forced to meet in walled compounds outside the city, undeterred by the inconvenience. The gathering in Jesus’ name mattered that much.

When I started Propel, an organization celebrating the passion, purpose, and potential of women who lead, the mission came under fire. Supposedly women weren’t to lead—yet every woman leads in some sphere: at home, work, church, school, community, globally.

## The Time Is Now

Another moment in time has come for the message of ReJesus. The global pandemic has forced a pause. What we once believed “worked” in the church no longer does—and now, perhaps, we are ready to ask what was ever really working, and why.

- What were we measuring, and why?
- What did we call “success,” and why?

Hopefully, we have realized that the answer is not in the latest method, message, or messenger. It is sobering how many influential evangelical churches and ministries have unraveled in just a few years. We have, willingly or not, been compelled to look in the mirror and ask, “Where have we gone wrong?” Perhaps we placed our hope in the wrong things—and need to rediscover the One who is the source of all hope, joy, and peace. I believe we will look back at this time as a profound gift—an opportunity to recalibrate.

It’s time to ReJesus.

The spiritual tectonic plates have shifted. We are surrounded by the rubble of what we once called “church.” It wasn’t working. Alan Hirsch and Michael Frost prophetically and practically show us how to rebuild from this place—how to be who we were always meant to be. They have given us the only way forward. The hope of the church is not in strategies, programs, or methods. It always was, and only ever will be, in Jesus.

This is a book whose time has come. We are finally ready to listen. It’s a new day. This generation wants nothing less than the Jesus of the Gospels, for he is the only Jesus. This book is a gift to the church. ReJesus is one of the most important books you will ever read. Read it slowly. Read it prayerfully. Read it often.

Because we all need to regularly ReJesus.

*Founder, A21 and Propel Women*

# Preface to the Second Edition

ReJesus was first published in 2008. Back then, we keenly sensed the need to call the church to recalibrate its faith around the centrality and significance of Jesus. We feel this need all the more today.

Maybe it’s because we both recently turned sixty. The older we get, the more we want to focus on what truly matters. We are done with the many “fixes” proposed for the church’s malaise: church growth movement, seeker sensitivity, emergent, “biblical manhood,” leadership industry, charismatic renewal—we’ve seen them all come and go, often leaving disappointment in their wake. At our age, we just want to keep the main thing the main thing.

Or perhaps it’s because recent events have revealed deep flaws in the contemporary evangelical church. As we write this, reports show huge numbers of pastors leaving ministry under the pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic. One survey found 50 percent have considered leaving in the last month; around 30 percent of Christians have stopped attending church during 2020–21, resulting in US church membership falling below a majority for the first time since records began. Recent scandals have further eroded confidence in the church. Prominent churches like Willow Creek and Mars Hill have been rocked. As our culture demands justice and inclusion, large sections of the church have responded in fear, embracing political postures that betray a spiritual and theological bankruptcy.

While 2020 should have signaled the dawn of a new decade, it instead marked a turning point for the church’s reputation, one many say comes perilously close to what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called “Christless Christianity.” We feel more than ever the call to pray, reground our faith in Jesus, and call others to do the same.

The truth is: we cannot afford to take our eyes off Jesus and hope to get our Christianity right. But Christians do lose sight of Jesus and need times of purification and renewal—voluntarily or not. God will have us be Christlike, or he will not have us at all. It’s his eternal plan: to unite all things in Christ (Col 1, Eph 1, Rom 5).

It is through this “ReJesus effect” that we learn again what is paramount. We gain clarity about who we are in Christ, what God expects, and how we are to serve him in every sphere of life. The reJesusing of the contemporary church cannot be content merely to celebrate Jesus as our Savior; it must also involve submitting to Jesus as our sovereign Lord and King. It means patterning our lives on Jesus as the holy human—the archetype of true humanity. Or, as Søren Kierkegaard said:

> “Christ is the truth inasmuch as he is the way. He who does not follow the way also abandons the truth. We possess Christ’s truth only by imitating him, not by speculating about him.”

We need to become a people who look, act, think, and sound like Jesus. To do so, we must identify and heal the reductionisms that plague contemporary Christianity. This is even more essential in the 2020s than it was in 2008.

## Christoformity: The Crisis of Our Time

While we have employed the term “ReJesus” to describe this process, the more theologically precise term is **Christoformity**—the church’s task of being conformed to the example and teachings of Christ. This is central because, in the eyes of the world, it is our legitimizing principle. The church’s mission and gospel are directly related to our lived confession.

As theologian **David Bentley Hart** writes:

> "Only if the form of Christ can be lived out in the community of the church is the confession of the church true; only if Christ can be practiced is Jesus Lord. … It is this presence within time of an eschatological and divine peace, really incarnate in the person of Jesus and forever imparted to the body of Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit, that remains the very essence of the church’s evangelical appeal to the world at large, and of the salvation it proclaims."

Too many onlookers dismiss Christ’s people precisely because they do not see the Christ we profess reflected in us. Even churches that appear “successful” may operate with leaders and agendas at odds with Christ’s explicit teachings. Alarmingly, evangelicalism’s “evangel” does not reliably produce Christlikeness. Many aspects of the church today are at odds with the person of Jesus.

Despite countless sermons, worship events, expenditures, books, and media, where is the evidence that these truly create people who are living expressions of Christ? Honest confession compels us to admit that, by and large, we have failed to embody Christ credibly in the world. Instead, we often see a grumpy, culturally captive, spiritually vacuous, and morally bankrupt religion.

**Russell Moore** laments:

> "The church is bleeding out the next generation not because 'the culture' is so opposed to the church’s fidelity to the truth, but just the reverse. The culture often does not reject us because they don’t believe the church’s doctrinal and moral teachings, but because they have evidence that the church doesn’t believe its own doctrinal and moral teachings. … They suspect that Jesus is just a means to an end—to some political agenda, to a market for selling merchandise, or for the predatory appetites of some maniacal narcissist."

Surely we need to look again at the astounding revelation of God in Jesus. As **N.T. Wright** indicates:

> "Jesus—the Jesus we might discover if we really looked, is larger, more disturbing, more urgent than we had ever imagined. … It is we, the churches, who have been the real reductionists. We have reduced the kingdom of God to private piety; the victory of the cross to comfort for the conscience; Easter itself to a happy, escapist ending after a sad, dark tale. Piety, conscience, and ultimate happiness are important, but not nearly as important as Jesus himself."

**Sarah Bessey** expresses it beautifully:

> "Despite all the ways the church might disappoint us, Jesus remains. He is worth it all. He is under the steeples and in the wilderness. He is in the megachurch and in the spiritual conversation at the bar. He inhabits our certainty and also our doubt. He is every good thing that ever was or will be, and He is still in the business of saving our lives. Really, that’s the thing. It is our hope and salvation, and everything else is just details."

If Jesus is not the center, who or what is? Christianity at its core is meant to be a life of conformity to Jesus—a life of discipleship. This involves a way of being in the world that is simple, peaceable, forgiving, and loving. Instead, we have often turned Christianity into a formal religion to avoid the demanding call of discipleship. So-called “believers” can be overtly warlike, greedy, racist, selfish, or vain, even at the highest levels, and still claim Jesus as “my personal Lord and Savior.” Does this sound familiar?

The only way back to authentic faith is to push reset and recalibrate ourselves to our Founder and his Way. It’s ReJesus time. Jesus alone is the Word of God; conformity to him is our highest calling.

## To Know Jesus Is to Know God

After the first edition was published, we heard concerns that the book underemphasized the Trinity. We affirm, with all orthodox Christians, the fundamental revelation of God as triune. Our focus is on a more “primal” New Testament trinitarianism—focusing on how Jesus introduces us to the Trinity and modeling our life on his relations with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

As Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar puts it, any approach to the Trinity must go through Christology and should stress the Christlikeness of God, moving from the relatively known (Jesus) to the relatively unknown (the inner life of the Trinity).

John’s Gospel was written so that we might believe Jesus is Messiah and Son of God (John 20:31). Jesus says:

> “‘Where is your father?’ they asked.  
> Jesus answered, ‘Since you don’t know who I am, you don’t know who my Father is. If you knew me, you would also know my Father.’”  
> — *John 8:19*

To know Jesus is to know God. Yet much of what passes for “Christian” today is a generic civil religion, emptied of Christ-formed content. Christians across ideological divides fail to display knowledge or understanding of the ways of Jesus—and thus, the ways of God. The incarnation tells us: God looks, acts, thinks, and sounds like Jesus.

So, how do we reJesus our lives and communities? The short answer: prayer and discipleship.

The confession of Christ is not just a theological differentiation, but a call to a transformed life of obedience, prayer, and authentic discipleship. To escape contemporary ideological fanaticisms, we must become hearers and doers of the Word (Matthew 25).

Von Balthasar wisely cautions:

> "Every Christian plan of the future will, and must, be valueless if it does not remain oriented toward Christ. … Only in the openness of contemplation and listening prayer is there revealed to us ever anew what Christ, in whom we have our origin, means and wants. Every action that is not rooted in contemplation is doomed to sterility from the start."

We become like Jesus not by our own strength, but by the grace shown in Jesus’ death for us, by the Holy Spirit’s power, and within the community of faith. The quest to emulate Jesus isn’t folly; when those forgiven embrace this journey, it is a world-changing call.

# Jesus Has Left the Building

> "Jesus is the center of all, the object of all; whoever does not know him, knows nothing aright, either of the world or of himself."  
> *—Blaise Pascal*

> "The means to know God is Christ, whom no one may know unless they follow after him with their life."  
> *—Hans Denck*

On June 7, 1964, the newly formed White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan gathered in Boykin Methodist Church near Raleigh, Mississippi. Protected by armed men and even aircraft, their Grand Chaplain prayed—using overtly Christian language—at what was essentially the inauguration of a racist death squad. Within weeks, three civil rights workers were murdered.

The apparent “Christ-focus” of groups like the Klan continues to shock. Frederick Douglass, over a century before the civil rights era, distinguished between the Christianity of Christ and the Christianity of this land:

> "Between the Christianity of this land and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest possible difference—so wide that to receive the one as good, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, and wicked. … I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ; I therefore hate the corrupt, slave-holding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason but the most deceitful one for calling the religion of this land Christianity."

How do followers of Jesus end up so far from his teaching and example? How could church members throughout history—the Lutheran Church in Nazi Germany, the Crusaders, the Conquistadors, the Rwandan death squads, or insurrectionists at the US Capitol—invoke Jesus’ name in service of violence or oppression?

This only increases our concern for a “Jesusless” church where Christ’s name is routinely invoked, but the Incarnate One is nowhere to be found.

It’s not just at Klan meetings or riots. The church’s wealth and privilege are reflected in grand cathedrals and basilicas. While admiring places like St. Peter’s Basilica, we must ask: “Where is the poor, itinerant rabbi from Nazareth?”

It is said that after Elvis Presley’s concerts, fans would chant his name until the PA announced, “Elvis has left the building.” Though many today chant for Jesus, we fear that “Jesus has left the building.”

## The Co-Option of Jesus to Ideological Causes

Keeping a clear vision of the true way of Jesus is challenging, especially within cultures nominally aligned with Christianity.

Missiologist David Bosch describes growing up as a racist Afrikaner, blind to the contradiction between his support for apartheid and Jesus’ teaching. Historian Adolf von Harnack lamented how every person remakes Jesus in their own image or receives at least a piece of Him that suits them. He saw the gospel’s primitive core overlaid by metaphysical concepts and church dogma.

Throughout history, Jesus has been conscripted to justify every kind of agenda:

- To some, a reformer of Judaism
- To others, a champion of violence or non-violence
- To some, a mystical sage; to others, a revolutionary or Aryan
- Even Sam Bowers, upon release from prison, never wavered in his belief that the Jesus he invoked was the “real” one

The problem, as Catholic George Tyrrell said of Protestant liberalism, is that:

> "The Christ that Harnack sees … is only the reflection of a liberal Protestant face, seen at the bottom of a deep well."

The challenge for the church today is to be taken captive by Jesus’ agenda—not to mold him to our own, however noble. We will never know him completely, but it is intrinsic to faith to keep striving. We must let Jesus be Jesus, joining his extraordinary mission for the world.

---

## Gospel-Centered or Jesus-Centered?

Recent crises—COVID-19, political polarization—have revealed entrenched problems in Western Christianity. One main cause is a shift from a christological to a soteriological focus: away from Jesus as Founder and Lord, toward doctrinal formulations about salvation (the “gospel”).

This shift reduces Christology to soteriology and has changed the faith’s character. “Gospel-centered” Christianity is often code for an ideological or cultural expression, rather than a Jesus-centered faith. As Bonhoeffer called it, it can devolve into “Christless Christianity.”

The “gospel-centered” movement cannot produce disciples because it does not require discipleship—just belief or assent; no ongoing obligation to be conformed to Christ. But the call of Jesus is to *become like him*. We cannot become like “the gospel”—that is, a doctrine—but we can conform ourselves to Jesus, the gospel with a face.

---

## Direct Implications for Our Discipleship

ReJesus-ing the church requires us to recover the radical and revolutionary call to follow Jesus in our context. Freedom in Jesus must challenge our idols—especially pervasive middle-class consumerism. Jesus challenges not only our religiosity, but our self-righteousness, greed, and complacency.

---

## Radical Challenges for Our Churches

Following Jesus demands more than institutional forms; it reshapes our mission. Without dealing with Christology, we cannot be missionally effective or have a balanced view of church. Too often, church “renewal” movements put the cart before the horse, focusing on forms rather than the Founder.

We must ask: Are we fundamentally aligned with Jesus’ will for his community? The church must be measured not against its own standards or history, but against the life, teaching, and example of Jesus.

---

## Reformulating Our Spirituality

If Jesus is our center, our guide, and mediator between God and humanity, we cannot bypass what this means for our spirituality. As Archbishop Michael Ramsey said: “God is Christlike, and in Him is no un-Christlikeness at all.” Or as Jesus himself said, “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father…” (John 14:9-10).

Jesus not only redefines our idea of God; he also models perfect humanity. Becoming like him is the heart of discipleship and Christian spirituality. Our spirituality is measured by our conformity to Jesus.

**C.S. Lewis** reflected:

> "It is easy to think that the Church has a lot of different objects—education, building, missions, holding services. [But] the Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs."
>
> — *C.S. Lewis*

This so-called “conspiracy of little Jesuses” is God’s plan for the world. It should be our aim and our standard.

---

## A Practical Missional Christology

For too long, Christology has been the domain of academics and church professionals. When the study of Jesus’ person and teaching becomes detached from daily discipleship and mission, Christianity loses its vitality.

Therefore, we propose a rediscovery of Christology focused on the example and teaching of Jesus for the purpose of emulation by all his followers. While we cannot emulate everything—such as Jesus’ redemptive death—we can imitate his sacrificial love, service, and other aspects of his life (e.g., Paul’s comparison of husbands loving their wives as Christ loved the church).

This book is not about church renewal for its own sake, nor strictly academic Christology. It is an attempt to reinstate the centrality of Jesus in the faith and mission of God’s people. More specifically, it seeks to recalibrate the church's mission around the Founder, Jesus.

ReJesus is a work of *missional Christology*: a call to vision and revitalize the church and personal faith around Jesus as Master of history and head of the church—against which the gates of hell will not prevail (Matt 16:18).

In short, it is about nothing less than reJesusing the church.

# I've Got a Picture of Jesus

> "Without the real human Jesus of Nazareth, we are at the mercy of anybody who tells us that 'Christ' is this, or that."
>
> — *N.T. Wright*

> "Jesus’ story reshapes our story. A believer’s past, present, and future take on redeemed significance as Jesus’ story infuses our story. Or better said: our story takes on eternal significance because Jesus’ story gathers up our individual stories, our individual past and present, into his redemptive story of love."
>
> — *Lynn H. Cohick*

In _Jesus and John Wayne_, Kristin Kobes Du Mez explores the cultural roots of contemporary American evangelicalism. She writes:

> "By the early 2000s, was it even possible to separate 'cultural Christianity' from a purer, more authentic form of American evangelicalism? What did it mean to be an evangelical? Did it mean upholding a set of doctrinal truths, or did it mean embracing a culture-wars application of those truths—a God-and-country religiosity that championed white men and working-class values, one that spilled over into a denigration of outsiders and elites, and that was organized around a deep attachment to militarism and patriarchal masculinity?"

Du Mez distinguishes two forms of Christianity operating in the US:

1. **The Christianity of the Culture War**  
   Seeks cultural dominance, particularly through political power. Its goal: To conquer society’s “seven mountains”—education, religion, family, business, government, entertainment, and media.

2. **The Christianity of Jesus**  
   Rooted in faithful confidence in the universal reign of Jesus, witnessing to the values of his kingdom in word and deed. It seeks to embody Christ's reign, not coerce society.

The latter is focused on **witnessing**, not **winning**. It offers its life as a testimony to the King, living as if Jesus is already in control. This is the heart of the reJesus project: to become more like Jesus. The way forward is not through conflict, enemy-making, or destroying opponents. Jesus modeled humility, gentleness, forgiveness, and peacemaking.

Christians seeking to claim cultural power are not our enemies; even if we think they are mistaken, our calling is to point people to the liberating example of Jesus.
