# Reconnecting with Scripture: Engaged Reading and Hebraic Knowing

> *"It is not so much that we raise questions about him, but that he raises questions of us."*  
> — Jewish proverb

## Beyond Exegesis: Reading Ourselves into the Text

Modern readers often struggle to connect with the Bible in a personally engaged manner. While exegesis is essential, we must also learn the spiritual art of reading ourselves into the text, actively participating in it. This practice, regularly discouraged within academic traditions, holds potential for richer, more transformative engagement.

In literature, readers are encouraged to empathize with characters to fully apprehend a text’s emotional and human dimensions. Applying this practice to Scripture animates the text, adding warmth, pathos, and perspective.

## Lectio Divina: The Ancient Practice of Divine Reading

One way to bridge the gap between written text and dynamic, addressed Word is through the ancient practice of *lectio divina* (Latin for “divine reading”). The Bible—God’s living, active, ever-new Word—demands more than comprehension; it calls for communion.

*Lectio divina*, first practiced by sixth-century monks and refined by Carmelite hermits, combines prayer and Scripture reading, facilitating deeper intimacy with God. It involves gradually releasing our own agendas and opening our hearts to God’s voice within the text. The process unfolds in four movements:

1. **Lectio (Reading):**  
   The passage is read aloud, slowly and reflectively, sometimes multiple times, allowing the Word to sink in.
2. **Meditatio (Meditation):**  
   After the second reading, the reader ruminates on the chosen text, drawing out what God intends to give. One may gravitate toward a phrase or word that seems of particular importance.
3. **Oratio (Prayer):**  
   The reader responds to the passage by opening their heart to God, engaging in an intuitive, heartfelt dialogue inspired by reflection on the Scripture.
4. **Contemplatio (Contemplation):**  
   The worshiper listens silently, freeing the mind and heart from distraction, resting in the Word and awaiting God’s voice at the deepest level.

Unlike exegesis, *lectio divina* is intensely personal and focused on application. It invites worshipers to lay aside their concerns and engage the text with an open heart.

## Letting the Text Read Us: A Jewish Perspective

A key block to true engagement lies in our assumption that we read the Bible as active agents. The Jewish reading reverses this: the Bible reads us. We are not its interpreters; rather, the Torah interprets us. Since Scripture is God’s self-revelation, the encounter is reciprocal. God addresses and challenges us personally, as seen supremely in Jesus, the incarnate Logos.

Engaging Jesus never allows for detached, objective interpretation. In Jesus, love is on the offensive, wooing us into a transformative encounter. When we bring Scripture into conversation with our ingrained assumptions—be it cultural values or personal preferences—we are confronted and called to respond: in faith and obedience, by distancing ourselves, or by diluting the text through reinterpretation. Too often, we domesticate Jesus’ radical demands, especially those found in the Beatitudes or the story of the rich young ruler, by spiritualizing or neutralizing them.

# Hebraic Ways of Knowing

To truly know God through the Scriptures, we need to broaden our modes of engagement. The Hebraic approach to knowing involves the heart, obedience, wonder, action, and intellect. Here, we focus primarily on the way of the heart (*orthopathy*) and the way of action (*orthopraxy*).

## Orthopathy: The Way of the Heart

To become like Jesus, we must move from mere spectatorship to active participation, intentionally applying his teachings. In New Testament encounters, remaining neutral or disengaged can be seen as the real sin (such as in the cases of the rich young ruler or Pilate). Transformation comes to those who allow Jesus to change them.

In biblical usage, the “heart” is the source not only of emotion, but also of will, loyalty, and commitment. It determines action as well as feeling, and is crucial in relating to God (see, e.g., Psalm 101:4; Isaiah 29:13; Matthew 15:8).

> *"The holy Scriptures do everywhere place religion very much in the affection; things such as fear, hope, love, hatred, desire, joy, sorrow, gratitude, compassion, and zeal. It is evidence that true religion, or holiness of heart, lies very much in the affection of the heart, that the Scriptures place the sin of the heart very much in hardness of heart. Now by a hard heart, is plainly meant an unaffected heart, or a heart not easy to be moved with virtuous affections."*  
> — Jonathan Edwards

Without engaging the heart, we cannot comprehend God. The heart enables understanding beyond the intellect. As the mystical work *The Cloud of Unknowing* observes:  
> *"Only to our mind is God incomprehensible, not to our heart."*

Biblical knowledge (*yada*) involves personal contact rather than detached observation. Knowing God is dynamic, mutual, and involves direct encounter.

Passion is required for true spirituality. As Søren Kierkegaard notes, “If passion is eliminated, faith no longer exists.” The search for God’s truth is a passionate, existential pursuit, requiring inwardness—an intense personal concern.

True spirituality, or “true religion,” must redeem and direct our spiritual passion. Only when the affections are moved by God does lasting transformation or action occur.

> *"No one is ever changed, either by doctrine, by hearing the word, or by the preaching or teaching of another, unless the affections are moved by these things. In a word, there is never any great achievement by the things of religion without a heart deeply affected by those things. True religion is placed in the affections."*  
> — Jonathan Edwards

**Key Principle:** We must engage the heart to truly understand, become like, and follow Jesus. The emotional connection with God yields unique insights available through no other means. Prayer and worship offer a valid, if subjective, kind of knowledge of God.

> *"Lex orandi, lex credendi, lex vivendi" — the law of prayer (or worship) is the law of faith, and the law of life. As we worship, so we will live—and as we worship, so we become. Worship expresses the community’s faith, but it also helps form it. Doctrines grow out of people’s actual life of prayer and worship."*  
> — Prosper of Aquitaine

## Orthopraxy: The Way of Action

Action, when done in Jesus’ name, confers grace and reveals God. In Jewish tradition, deeds done in God’s name are sacramental—opportunities for partnership with God in the world’s redemption.

> *"Our actions, or more particularly our missional deeds, also confer grace. In fact, this could be the case even more so than the standard sacraments of the Christendom church. Humans have the freedom to protest against human suffering by acting to alleviate it. But it is the act itself, when done in the name of Jesus, that bestows the grace of God—not only to the beneficiary, but also to the benefactor."*  
> — *The Shaping of Things to Come*

Elie Wiesel writes:

> *"You see a musician in the street; you give him a thousand francs instead of ten; he’ll believe in God. … You see a forsaken old man; open your heart to him, and he’ll believe in himself. You will have surprised them. Thanks to you, they will have trembled, and everything around them will vibrate. Blessed is he capable of surprising and of being surprised."*

Such deeds are both sacramental and revelatory, making God’s goodness visible. In Talmudic thought:  
> *"From within his own deed, man as well as nation hears the voice of God."*

The key to this form of knowledge is obedience.

> *"Only conformity to God’s will can open up access to knowledge of the figure of Christ."*  
> — Helmut Thielicke

James writes:

> *"Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says … whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do. … Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."*  
> — James 1:21–27

**Key Principle:** Theoretical knowledge is never sufficient in Scripture. According to the Hebraic worldview, Christian knowledge is inextricably tied to—and evidenced by—experience, action, and obedience. Obedience is the true measure of understanding. As Calvin wrote, “All right knowledge of God is born in obedience.”

> *"For Paul, as for Jesus, practice is the touchstone of authenticity. Practice is the visible criterion that we have seriously received grace."*  
> — Jacques Ellul

## Not Forgetting Orthodoxy

While orthopathy (right feeling) and orthopraxy (right action) are essential, they do not nullify the need for orthodoxy (right belief):

> *"Lex sequendi, lex credendi" — the law of following is the law of belief.*

Christian worship, ethics, and mission are all centered in Jesus Christ; following him gives birth to understanding him. Christian doctrines arise in part from the experience of following Jesus.

We propose that discipleship involves the integration of all three:

- **Orthodoxy (Right Thinking)** — *Head* (*Word*)
- **Orthopraxy (Right Acting)** — *Hands* (*Works*)
- **Orthopathy (Right Feeling)** — *Heart* (*Wonders*)

True engagement with God is found at the intersection of head, heart, and hands. Overemphasis on one distorts discipleship: orthopraxy alone leads to burnout; orthopathy alone leads to unmoored mysticism; orthodoxy alone leads to doctrinaire arrogance.

> *"A true understanding of God requires Word, Works, and Wonders interacting together."*  
> — John Wimber

As affirmed in the Shema (Deut 6:4–9) and by Jesus (Mark 12:28–34), we are to love God with all our heart, mind, will, and strength.

An illustration from Luke 7: Jesus is impressed with a Roman centurion whose life exemplifies the convergence of orthopraxy (building a synagogue), orthodoxy (right belief in Jesus' authority), and orthopathy (humility). It is this nexus that draws a cry of joy from Jesus: faith, action, and right heart together.

# ReJesus: Recovering the Center

When we speak of Jesus as the center or norm, we mean Jesus of Nazareth—crucified, risen, present by the Spirit—not an abstract idea or a truncated historical figure. The history of New Testament interpretation, particularly influenced by form criticism (Bultmann, et al.), has often dissected the Gospels, losing their holistic integrity. N. T. Wright and others urge a return to a more Jewish appreciation of the Gospels as unified testimony, suggesting that only by returning “home” to these roots can the church recover vitality.

> *"We believe that we can have absolute confidence in the reliability of the Gospels, precisely by coming to them as their original Jewish hearers would. The Hebraic worldview invites us to come to the ancient texts in a different way."*

Renewed engagement with Jesus requires a transformation not just of heart, but of worldview.

> *"Throw open every door, shine a light in every darkened corner. Show me which rooms I haven’t invited you into. Give me the grace to offer everything of my life to you, even if undeserving. What I must do, teach me how to do it. What I must know, open my mind to understand. What I must bear, give me the strength to bear it. What I must feel, grant me the freedom to experience it. You are my King; I am under your authority. I know you can but say the word, and I will be transformed. Say that word, dear Jesus. I am frightened, but I beseech you to say the word and make my house clean. Amen."*

# The Church That Jesus Built

> *"The ultimate problem, which has caused our theological helplessness, lies in the separation between Jesus Christ and the Church."*  
> — Dietrich Ritschl

> *"I grow increasingly concerned that we have a massive population of people who have placed their faith in Christianity rather than Christ. Faith in Christianity is utterly bereft of power to save a single soul. It is Jesus who saves."*  
> — Beth Moore

Dan Kimball’s interviews with unchurched youth reveal that Jesus is attractive, but the church is often seen as political, negative, judgmental, and irrelevant.

> *"I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ."*  
> — Mahatma Gandhi

Just as a rocket slightly off course can miss the moon by thousands of miles, so too the church, if deviating from Jesus at its center, will miss its purpose. The church must be constantly realigned and recalibrated around its founder.

## The Marks of God’s Reign

David Gushee and Glen Stassen, examining Jesus’ references to Isaiah, identify seven marks of God’s reign, seen in the ministry of Jesus:

1. **Deliverance/Salvation:**  
   From oppression to freedom.
2. **Justice:**  
   Everyone has enough.
3. **Peace and Harmony:**  
   Not hatred or deception.
4. **Healing:**  
   Not sickness and disease.
5. **Restoration:**  
   In families and communities.
6. **Joy:**  
   People filled with life.
7. **Experience of God’s Presence**

The church that Jesus built is a people who acknowledge him as king, offer their lives under his authority, and live out this constellation of values.

# Paul’s Vision of the Jesus Community

Paul, especially in Ephesians, explores the reality of the church as:

- Jesus as "head over all things for the church" (Eph 1:22)
- The church as *his body* (Eph 1:23)
- The *fullness* of Jesus: "the fullness of him who fills all in all"
- Part of God’s *eternal purpose* (Eph 3:10–11), displaying God’s wisdom to the heavenly realms
- The sphere in which God is glorified "in the church and in Christ Jesus" (Eph 3:21)
- The place where Jesus gives his gifts (APEST: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, teachers) to attain maturity in him (Eph 4:1–16)
- The beloved, whom Jesus loved and gave himself for (Eph 5:25)
- Those whom Jesus "nourishes and tenderly cares for" (Eph 5:29)
- A work in progress, to be presented holy and without blemish (Eph 5:27)

**Key Insight:**  
The true church is not an institution, but an intimate network of Jesus followers, saturated with his presence and marked by deep interpersonal relationship. The church issues forth from Jesus; it is defined by what Jesus does for his followers, and what they become as a result.

> *“Young man, you change your life, or you change your name.”*  
> — Alexander the Great (apocryphal)

If we take on Jesus' name, our lives must mirror it.

# Conclusion: Returning to Our Roots

If we return to the Gospels and the example of Jesus, the church regains its original DNA:  
- A family of followers striving—however imperfectly—to be Christlike  
- Living with justice, peace, joy, healing, restoration, and the tangible presence of God  
- Defined not by passive attendance, but by active obedience, wonder, right belief, and deep engagement with both God and neighbor

Let us, then, reorient our theology and our ecclesial life around Jesus, that the world might see not only a church built by Christ, but Christ himself in our midst.
