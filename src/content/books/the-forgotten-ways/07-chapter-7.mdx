---# The Missional-Incarnational Impulse

> Just as the Father sends me, so I send you.  
> — Jesus in John 20:21 (author's translation)

> The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation, since every generation has its own unique questions. The gospel must constantly be forwarded to a new address, because the recipients are repeatedly changing their place of address.  
> — Helmut Thielicke

> It should not bother us that [during different epochs] the Christian faith was perceived and experienced in new and different ways. The Christian faith is intrinsically incarnational; therefore unless the church chooses to remain a foreign entity, it will always fully enter into the context in which it happens to find itself.  
> — David Bosch, *Transforming Mission*

## Learning by Doing

Interns are encouraged to "jump in at the deep end," drawing from their current repertoire of skills and gifts, and becoming more open to real learning. Much of this learning comes from "having a go" and actually doing things, inspired by the framework of Dave Ridgway and James Jesudason. Interns meet at least weekly with a coach who offers debriefs, identifies problems, suggests actions, and refers them to resources such as books and conferences.

These learning intensives are led only by active missional practitioners—those who have demonstrated the capacity to do what they teach. Through this approach, interns increase their ability to grasp, resolve, and integrate key issues. Mission, as the "mother of good theology," often results in Holy Spirit-led movements that instinctively "get it right" without needing extensive theory. This is a latent element of the church's "Apostolic Genius," emerging when adaptation is demanded. This ongoing, dynamic transmission of faith—the "megaconspiracy of Little Jesus"—is how faith is passed from person to person through generations.

## The Missional-Incarnational Impulse: Definition and Pattern

### Liminality and APEST

> The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation.
  
This impulse is best seen in missional movements that combine two discrete theological motivators:

- **Missional:** The outward, sending movement of the church.
- **Incarnational:** The embedding and embodiment of the gospel within the host culture.

Jesus himself commissioned, "Just as the Father sends me, so I send you," making clear both the fact and the manner of our sentness: as embodied messages, incarnationally. To model our sentness on Christ, we must embrace this impulse to facilitate transformation and multiplication.

## Theology Drives Methodology

Our primary theology deeply shapes our primary methodology. Two foundational doctrines infuse this practice with meaning:

1. **The Missio Dei:** Mission as the result of God's initiative and purpose, not merely human activity.
2. **The Incarnation:** God's self-embodiment in Jesus as the model for our mission.

> "Mission is not merely an activity of the church. Rather, mission is the result of God’s initiative, rooted in God’s purposes to restore and heal creation... Mission means 'sending,' and it is the central biblical theme describing the purpose of God’s action in human history."  
> — Darrell Guder, *Missional Church*

## From Attractional to Missional: Patterns and Diagrams

The Christendom model often relies on an "in-drag" attractional approach—inviting people in to our space—effective primarily in low-complexity cultures. In contrast, a genuinely missional impulse sends us outwards; it is centrifugal, like seeds sown on the wind.

**Missional Impulse: Outward Seeding and Spreading**
- Authentic mission is inspired by a "go-to-them" (sent) approach.
- A genealogy metaphor: mission as the transfer of mDNA—stories and DNA from one community to the next.
- The “viral” pattern: the gospel multiplies as it moves outward.

**Evangelistic-Attractional Impulse:**
- This is effective only in cultures where significant barriers do not exist.
- Sole reliance on the attractional model blocks the outward "sneeze" built into the gospel.

> We will have to learn to trust the kingdom of God to do the job of scattering, watering, and growing the seeds (1 Cor. 3:6–7).

## The Six Dimensions of the Incarnation

John 1:1–18 is the definitive text for the Incarnation. The work and person of Jesus display six defining dimensions, which frame incarnational mission:

1. **Presence:** God is fully present in Jesus (John 1:1–15; Col. 2:9).
2. **Proximity:** God comes near in a way we understand and can access (Mark 1:15; Luke 19:10).
3. **Prevenience:** God prepares hearts—he is at work before us (John 5:19–20).
4. **Powerlessness:** God becomes a servant, renouncing coercive power (Phil. 2:6–11).
5. **Passion:** Christ feels compassion and pathos for others, taking suffering upon himself (Mark 6:34; Isa. 53).
6. **Proclamation:** God’s presence initiates an active, ongoing gospel invitation.

> "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory."  
> — John 1:14

**Implications for Mission:**

- **Presence:** Engage the humanity of the community; relationships are key.
- **Proximity:** Be involved across societal lines; active presence and availability required.
- **Prevenience:** Discern God’s prior work in every context; join what God is already doing.
- **Powerlessness:** Embrace humility and servanthood, not domination.
- **Passion:** Engage with compassion and empathy, addressing real pain.
- **Proclamation:** Faithfully transmit the gospel in word and deed.

## Incarnational Mission in Practice

To act incarnationally means genuine identification with those we seek to reach. This often requires moving into their space and establishing an abiding presence. The motive is revelation: so that others may come to know God through Jesus.

**Examples:**
- InnerChange, serving among the poor, live below the poverty line, spending 80% of their time in community—ensuring credibility and real identification.
- Urban ministries such as Life in Deep Ellum, Oregon Public House, and others embed their presence in coffee shops, theaters, and public spaces.
- Networks like Soma Communities transform former "church" spaces into community hubs, nightclubs, or studios for local engagement.

The incarnational strategy is about taking the church to the people, not bringing people to church.

## Missional-Incarnational Dynamics: Going Out and Going Deep

To summarize, both impulses are necessary:

- **Missional impulse:** Outward, sowing and seeding in new communities.
- **Incarnational impulse:** Deep embedding and contextualization within those communities.

Just as two blades make a scissors functional, these impulses together define fruitful, multiplying movements.

> "Many think this is fine. I have heard people say, 'We have plenty of churches ... we don’t need more churches but better ones.' Can you imagine making such a statement about people? ... No matter how inflated you think the world population is, we are only one generation away from extinction if we do not have babies."  
> — Neil Cole

## Contextualization: The Five P’s

Developed by Richard and Dory Gorman:

1. **Power:** Who are the powerful? The powerless? How does the gospel address this?
2. **Pennies (Economy):** Who are the rich and poor? How does the gospel speak?
3. **Pain:** Where is the pain? What is the gospel response?
4. **Parties:** Where are the celebrations? How can we join in?
5. **Persons of Peace:** Who are community gatekeepers? How can we serve them?

Mission and conversion travel on the relational fabric of a culture. Open social networks are essential for exponential growth.

## Missional Ecclesiology: Christology—Missiology—Ecclesiology

> Christology determines missiology, and missiology determines ecclesiology.

This principle means:

- Start with Jesus (Christology).
- Let your sense of mission (Missiology) flow from him.
- Let the forms and functions of church (Ecclesiology) flow from your mission.

Ecclesiology is historically and culturally fluid—the forms are "earthen vessels" for the treasure of Christ, adaptable to context as long as they are anchored in the gospel and the example of Jesus.

> "Start with the Church and the mission will probably get lost. Start with mission and it is likely that the Church will be found."  
> — *Fresh Expressions* training materials

## The Cycle of Incarnation-Innovation

True incarnational mission leads to innovative new forms of church, tailored to culture and context. Observe, immerse, interpret, translate, and incarnate the gospel so that each new Jesus community emerges organically from the context.

## Toward a Missional-Incarnational Future

In conclusion, the missional-incarnational impulse is foundational:

- It promotes exponential growth and reproduction.
- It fosters deeply contextualized, authentic gospel communities.
- It returns us to the heart of apostolic, multiplying movements.

> In its simplest form, following the missional-incarnational impulse means allowing Jesus to lead us into the marketplaces, third places, and homes of those in our lives—teaching us how to become redemptive, incarnated expressions of the gospel in every nook and cranny of our culture.

# Liminality and Communitas

> The main stimulus for the renewal of Christianity will come from the bottom and from the edge, from sectors of the Christian world that are on the margins.  
> — W. C. Roof

> It is the unknown that defines our existence. We are constantly seeking, not just for answers to our questions, but for new questions. We are explorers.  
> — Cmdr. Benjamin Sisko, *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine*

> You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life or death to you.  
> — C. S. Lewis

New levels of generosity, transformation, and true community often emerge in moments of shared crisis or ordeal—what anthropologists call *liminality* and its resultant experience of *communitas*. In missional contexts, these experiences produce the depth of relationship and purpose seen in the most dynamic Jesus movements.

Missional church is forged in liminality: by stepping out at the edge, entering the unknown, and joining others at the margins.
