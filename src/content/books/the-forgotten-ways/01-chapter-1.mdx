> "If you want to build a ship, don’t summon people to buy wood, prepare tools, distribute jobs, and organize the work, rather teach people the yearning for the wide, boundless ocean."
>
> —Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

This is not another book about how to do church. It’s not a manual detailing the latest techniques to grow your ministry or a program designed to bring a struggling church back to life. Instead, my friend Alan Hirsch wants us to remember the essential mission of the church. He wants us to long for God’s kingdom in the way that the early church did.

In the first edition of this book, Alan borrowed from the famed writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry to explain what he was about: teaching people to yearn for the wide, boundless ocean. In *The Forgotten Ways*, Alan is calling us not to build churches but to yearn to be part of God’s mission in the world. He asks us to consider questions such as:

- What did the early church see as its mission?
- What did they believe Christ had birthed the church for?
- How did they understand John 20:21, when Jesus said to his disciples, “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you”?

In short, what did it mean for the early church to join Jesus on his mission?

The idea of mission being a defining focal point in the life of the church and the believer is certainly found in the practices of the New Testament church—and really within the totality of Scripture. Yet at times, as Alan reminds us, the church has lost sight of its mission and purpose, content to muddle along without a clear sense of direction. Mission has become simply one of many tasks that a church does, rather than what a church *is*.

However, as Karl Barth famously argued at the Brandenburg Missionary Conference in 1932, mission isn’t an attribute of the church or the individual Christian, but rather mission is an attribute of God himself—in which the church joined. God, in other words, is the first missionary. At the time, this idea was not widely embraced, but later it would become the consensus view, not only in the mainline Protestant world but among evangelicals and Catholics as well.

It’s not that Barth was right on everything—evangelicals like Alan and I would have some differences with Barth. Yet, in many ways, the Barthian idea of mission reminds us of the church’s identity, purpose, and focus. Barth’s insistence on recapturing the New Testament expressions of Christianity led to a new focus on the missional essence of the church. His ideas have sparked most of the missiological conversations of the past forty years.

But it’s not enough to want to embed the church’s identity back into the missional identity of God; nor is it enough to say we need to restore the so-called missional glory of the early church in churches today. To be sure, these things are essential; however, the embedment of the church’s identity into the missional nature of God and the desire for restoration is what leads to embodiment. Recovering and reactivating the identity and purpose of the church allow for the rediscovery of the church’s approaches and practices, which can be expressed in any cultural form. This leads to questions such as:

- What does the church do?
- How should believers live?
- What paths should we take?
- How do we faithfully live present lives in the cities and communities where churches have been planted?
- What are the implications for the church today in claiming Jesus is Lord, not Caesar?

In short, recovering the identity of the church in the Triune God and his mission allows the church to rediscover its forgotten ways—that it is a living, breathing, life-giving apostolic movement. *The Forgotten Ways* has become a foundational text for exploring the missional nature of the church, challenging those wanting to understand both the missional conversation and what it means for the church to reactivate its forgotten ways.

I’m honored that Alan asked me to write the foreword for his new edition, for both he and his work have blessed me over the years. I’m blessed to be a part, in some small way, of this book as Alan puts forth his ideas for a new generation longing to rediscover the church’s missional nature and to reactivate anew its forgotten ways.

When I read Alan’s words, I want to drop what I’m doing and focus my attention again on God’s mission. After reading this book, I imagine you will as well.

# Preface to the Second Edition

> If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro’ narrow chinks of his cavern.
>
> —William Blake, *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*

> The composition of this book has been for the author a long struggle of escape, and so must reading of it be for most readers if the author’s assault upon them is to be successful,—a struggle of escape from habitual modes of thought and expression. The ideas which are here expressed so laboriously are extremely simple and should be obvious. The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify ... into every corner of our minds.

I can still remember the day when, after years of trying to grasp the dynamics of apostolic movements, I experienced a singular “Eureka!” moment—a flash of revelatory insight. I make no claim for special authority in this; rather, I feel I received it from God as a direct response to my ardent search for answers. Despite how academic this book might feel at times, it is much more the product of a “thought experiment” of a reflective missional practitioner than it is clinical “lab” research done in libraries or through the scientific methodology of a PhD program.

I do not claim that I logically investigated my way to a viable theory of movement; rather, I felt the answer was graciously given to me, and that I was called to be its custodian. Sure, I did my homework in my own way and to the best of my ability, but I absolutely knew that I felt called—compelled, even—to unlock the codes of movement. I understood it as a spiritual quest in which my life’s purpose was somehow involved. It was years before the insight was given.

My conclusion? *Love something long enough, and it will eventually reveal itself to you.*

After this insight, I scrambled to get the ideas down on paper. When I was finished, I realized what I had been given was, in some way, world-changing. Again, I don’t want to be misunderstood: I have no grandiose sense of myself (in fact, I am genuinely surprised by God’s choices), and I don’t claim what I came to call “Apostolic Genius” (the term I invented for the system put forth in this book) as my own. Not at all! I see it as the heritage of all God’s people, and I was privileged to name it afresh for this generation and context—namely, Western Christianity at the dawn of the twenty-first century.

I believe Apostolic Genius does capture something of the mystery of the church in its most eloquent and transformative form. Most feedback I have received expresses that people feel they “kind of remember the material,” or that it describes exactly what they have been thinking—I only gave it words. This is wonderful to me, because it means the answer is already latent in God’s people, and that the Holy Spirit is once again brooding over the church, awakening us to our own purposes and potentials as God’s people. God’s purposes are already revealed in the very nature of discipleship and the church. Our greatest truths are remembered; they are retrievals, not inventions—a reclamation of a lost imagination whose newness is so old that it has been forgotten. This is particularly true regarding the primordial truths of the faith, including, of course, the nature and purpose of the church.

I believe the answer to the crisis of our time is found in our most primary and defining story of church—the New Testament church. In other words, I believe this material belongs to you as a believer, to your church or organization, and to all of God’s people everywhere. I am a mere custodian, drawing on the rich phraseology of Walter Brueggemann’s description of the prophet’s task: to call Israel to remembrance (see *Prophetic Imagination*).

I hope to be a faithful steward of that which has been entrusted to me (Matt. 25:23). This second edition is my attempt to deliver.

### Developments Since the First Edition

Since publishing *The Forgotten Ways* in 2006, I have written about each of the elements of mDNA to further explain them. While designed as stand-alone books, all point back to and elaborate substantially on the Apostolic Genius model presented here. Furthermore, Apostolic Genius is part of the very genetics of the primary organizations with which I am directly involved: Forge Mission Training Network International, Future Travelers, and 100 Movements (100M) are all built squarely on the insights of *The Forgotten Ways*. Many other organizations and churches have adopted the Apostolic Genius model as an operating system, all helping God’s people “remember” the easily forgotten ways of the church-as-Jesus-movement.

I have also labored to awaken the movement ethos in every major denominational system in North America, trained many primary church-planting agencies in the U.S. and Europe, lectured in major seminaries and colleges, and coached leading-edge missional churches. I remain committed, now more than ever, to the belief that movements are the way forward, because they are, in the deepest sense, who we are and what we are called to be.

### The Need for Movement

Jesus’s explicit example, his teaching on the in-breaking kingdom, his work in establishing the gospel, and his entrusting of these to the movement he initiated, all commit his people to being a permanent revolution rather than a civil religion that blindly defends tradition or conserves the status quo. Most Western churches adhere, consciously or unconsciously, to the concept of civil religion, which leads us back to its source: the missional bankruptcy of the historic European church.

We must move beyond distinctly European modes of thinking about church to recover the more primordial New Testament sensibilities. The future health and viability of the Christian church are bound to its retrieval of a more fluid, adaptive, and dynamic movement-based form of ecclesia.

### On Paradigm Change and Missional Renaissance

There is no doubt in my mind that movement thinking is an idea whose time has come; there is a sense of inevitability about it. There is no other viable way forward based on the inherited paradigm and thinking. The way forward must first take us backward—past denominational histories and historical trajectories—to the original phenomenon articulated in the New Testament: the apostolic movement.

We need refounding, perhaps even more than we need reformation. The basic ideas presented in this book, especially regarding the elements of mDNA (Jesus-focused culture, discipleship, incarnational mission, innovation and risk, multiplication organizing, APEST, etc.), have seen significant adoption across Protestant denominations and institutions. As far as the broader idea of the missional church, our best and brightest minds know there is no going back to an idealized past or to civil religion. Those days are irretrievably gone—and that may be for the best, as it compels us to act as our original founders did.

There is no plan B for the church in the West: either we choose missional renaissance or face the specter of ever-encroaching demise. The challenge is that—while we can analyze the crisis—most Christians have yet to grasp a viable way forward. We lack a theoretical framework and an integrative vision that makes sense of the crisis and provides a way to reconceive and redesign the church.

This book proposes just that: a synthesized, integrated model that does justice to the primary codes of Jesus’s church and provides a way forward.

### Distinctives of This Book

While other books describe movements, most limit themselves to church-planting or disciple-making movements, offering prescriptive, plug-and-play lists based on premodern, pre-Christian societies, with little attempt to adapt phenomenology to a postmodern, post-Christian, individualistic, consumerist culture. By contrast, I have striven to adapt movement thinking to complex, contemporary Western expressions of church and culture.

Signs of hope abound:

- New incarnational expressions of church have emerged
- Church planting is a growing strategic priority
- Renewed commitments to discipleship are evident
- Recoveries of a Jesus-based, gospel-inspired spirituality are visible
- APEST (apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, teaching) dynamics are increasingly recognized
- Innovative new organizations are reaching into marginalized cultures

Yet, mature expressions of Apostolic Genius—where all six mDNA elements operate together—remain rare. Nevertheless, a few such models are maturing and may soon chart a new course for others to follow, as Willow Creek and Saddleback did for the seeker-sensitive model.

### Not a How-To Book

This is not a how-to manual; rather, it is a challenge to the imagination, an invitation to embrace the New Testament’s movement-based paradigm and to continuously evaluate and, if necessary, overturn inherited systems. As Upton Sinclair observed, “It is exceedingly difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” Vested interests can blind us, and so the paradigm war is far from over.

Our inherited maps are inadequate—they were formulated for a world no longer ours. We need synthesis more than ever, a grand vision allowing us to put habitual activities into big-picture context. Alvin Toffler put it well: “You’ve got to think about big things while you’re doing small things, so that all the small things go in the right direction.” New mental maps—and holy imagination—are vital if we are to chart a path forward.

Leadership, then, is critical. Leaders are custodians of the church’s codes—a role of deep accountability. Times of transition demand fresh imagination and repentance: *metanoia*, a true paradigm shift. Repentance is not a dirty word but a gift, making possible deep and godly change. Many leaders now acknowledge that old forms are failing and that only a Jesus movement paradigm will provide the needed hope and transformation.

# Changes in Language and Structure

With this new edition, there are several important changes in terminology:

- **Apostolic Environment** has been replaced by **APEST Culture** to better capture the ministry, functions, and leadership ethos of movements. "APEST" (Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Shepherding, Teaching) is more comprehensive and meaningful for evaluating biblical ministry in the church.
- **Communitas, not Community** is now simply **Liminality-Communitas**, since liminality (danger, risk, marginality, disorientation) is inseparable from communitas.
- The order of the mDNA chapters has been revised to group naturally related elements (e.g., discipleship with the priority of Jesus).

These changes are necessary to ensure clarity and to reflect the developments and applications of the Apostolic Genius model in various contexts.

# Issues of Style and Substance

*The Forgotten Ways* is not a practical how-to book; it never was. It is meant to shift paradigms and raise consciousness about the unconscious operating systems underlying church life. I have, however, written companion volumes that apply these ideas, such as *The Forgotten Ways Handbook* and *On the Verge* with Dave Ferguson.

This book unapologetically addresses the reader’s imagination first. It presents an alternative paradigm—a synthetic framework—to re-envision the church in its most primordial, movemental form. The first section provides analysis; the second proposes the synthesis and way forward. New readers may find the initial sections dense, but repeated readings will yield greater clarity.

While the footnotes are extensive, they are intended to enrich the conversation without hampering the narrative flow. Four new appendices provide further, though not essential, reading.

# Onward, Upward, Forward

If we are to unlock the vast potentials—“Apostolic Genius”—that lie largely dormant in God’s people, then the movemental paradigm suggested in this book must supplant the dominant institutional one as the primary lens through which we view the church. This paradigm unlocks possibilities and aligns the church with God’s enduring processes.

> —H. Richard Niebuhr

> After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force.... The movement is natural, arising spontaneously. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results.

> In a time of drastic change, it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.
>
> —Eric Hoffer, *Reflections in the Human Condition*

Imagine a power lying hidden at the heart of God’s people—an inbuilt missional capacity, instilled by the Holy Spirit, but long buried and forgotten. If rediscovered, this latent power could unleash energies to propel the church well into the next century, akin to a spiritual unlocking of the atom.

This is not mere fantasy. All true Jesus communities and believers possess these primal forces. History’s greatest Christian movements demonstrate them, and their stories inspire us to recover and reactivate them.

# Introduction

The shift from modern to postmodern (or, from solid to liquid modernity) over the past fifty years has left the church disoriented, with traditional frameworks proving inadequate. The challenges are not merely intellectual, but spiritual, emotional, and existential. Facing complexities such as terrorism, technological innovation, environmental crisis, rampant consumerism, and discontinuous change, the church is on a significant decline in the West.

Major questions must be asked:

- Will more of the same suffice?
- Do we have the inherited resources to face this situation?
- Can tweaking the Christendom system finally yield the desired result?

I do not believe inherited formulas will work. Much current thinking about the church amounts to theological reworking (changing the software) while ignoring organizational hardware and operating systems.

What we need now is a new set of tools—a new paradigm—a fundamental change in how we perceive church and mission. The problem is that we seldom go deep enough for answers, retreating to safety when faced with radical remedies.

The conditions of our time now demand a solution going to the very roots of what it means to be Jesus’s people. Our crisis is also an opportunity to recover the ancient energies at the church's heart—what I call *Apostolic Genius*.

# The Question That Started a Quest

Several years ago, attending a seminar on missional church, the speaker asked:

1. How many Christians do you think there were in the year AD 100?
2. How many Christians do you think there were just before Constantine, say, AD 310?

- **AD 100:** as few as 25,000 Christians
- **AD 310:** up to 20,000,000 Christians

He asked: *How did they do this?* How did they grow from a small movement to the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire within two centuries?

That question has shaped my quest to find the “missiological holy grail,” to identify what produces such amazing growth and impact despite the odds. This search led to the formulation of “Apostolic Genius”—the generative system underlying all genuine, transformative Jesus movements—and its component elements, “movement DNA” or mDNA.

### Key Factors the Early Church Lacked

Consider the following:

- They were members of an illegal religion, often persecuted.
- They did not have church buildings as we know them.
- They lacked the completed Scriptures.
- They had no formal institution or professional leadership.
- They had no seeker-sensitive services, youth groups, worship bands, seminaries, or commentaries.
- They made it difficult to join the church—aspiring converts underwent a significant period of initiation.

And yet, in two centuries, their numbers grew exponentially.

### Modern Movements Echo This Pattern

The underground church in China, for example, flourished under persecution. When foreign missionaries returned in the early 1980s, they found not a decimated church but one numbering tens of millions. Despite lacking resources, centralized organization, clergy, or mass meetings, Christianity in China has grown dramatically—estimates now range up to 120 million.

Similarly:

- The Methodist movement grew to claim 34% of the American population by 1850.
- Pentecostalism has grown from the early 1900s to an estimated half a billion adherents worldwide by the early twenty-first century.

### The Central Task

The task of this book is to identify the core elements—the matrix of theology, ideas, and practices—that generate and sustain transformative movements. The phenomenon behind movements is Apostolic Genius; the elements that compose it are mDNA.

The stories of these movements provide mirrors for our own church experience. They challenge us to recover the authentic, vibrant, and transformative ways that Jesus intended for his people.

As we face our own adaptive challenges in the twenty-first century, threatened not by persecution but by complexity and cultural marginalization, we must ask: *Will we recover these forgotten ways?*

The answers already lie within us—and this book seeks to help us reactivate them.
