---# APEST Culture: Almost a Silver Bullet

## Introduction

The APEST (Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Shepherding, Teaching) ministry complex is foundational to envisioning the ecclesia Jesus designed. All five functions are essential for the church to flourish as Jesus intended.

## Understanding APEST Culture

Culture is a tapestry woven from diverse symbols, forms, ideas, languages, actions, rituals, and more. The term “APEST culture” is meant to encompass not only personal vocation and calling, but also the myriad social functions related to each aspect of APEST, along with the symbols and language used to convey the church’s ministry and mission. Thus, APEST culture is a comprehensive framework for assessing, understanding, and developing the church’s full ministry.

Missional church demands a ministry and leadership system capable of initiating, generating, developing, and sustaining movements. Historically, the Christendom church has undermined a full missional leadership system, reducing ministry to primarily shepherding and teaching roles. Over time, these roles became the only legitimate “orders of ministry” in the eyes of many denominations, weighted towards doctrinal maintenance and pastoral care.

As such, the system has achieved almost exclusively pastoral and educational outcomes—precisely what you would expect from a system designed by shepherds and teachers. By omitting the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic functions from the original recipe, we have ended up with a deeply reduced ministry. To become the church Jesus intended (Eph. 4:12–16), we must return to his original design (Eph. 4:7–11).

> *“The central task of leadership in existing churches is to rebuild a fully empowered ministering community based on Ephesians 4:11–12.”*  
> *—Howard Snyder, Decoding the Church*

### The Exiling of APE (Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic)

The sidelining of the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic ministries is well-documented. While these ministries never entirely disappeared, they often lacked formal legitimacy, leading many to serve outside local church contexts, denominational systems, and seminaries. This exile contributed to the rise of parachurch agencies and missional orders:

- **The Navigators**: Evangelize and disciple beyond church structures.
- **Sojourners**: Represent social justice concerns often ignored by the church.
- **World Vision**: Aid and development agency led by apostolic and prophetic leadership styles.

The separation of APE from Shepherding and Teaching (ST) has been disastrous for church health and the mission of Christ.

#### The Need for Shepherds and Teachers

We need shepherds and teachers—there is no disputing that—but the issue is what has been excluded from biblical ministry. Where are the generative ministries—apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic—so evident in the New Testament? The full APEST is constitutionally integrated into the body of Christ for mutual edification, maturity, and attaining the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:11–16). Running the church on only two cylinders leads to stagnation; restoring APEST’s full “coding” can catalyze transformation.

## Understanding the Core and Integration of APEST Ministries

To grasp the unique nature of each APEST ministry, consider the following:

- The **core tasks/functions** of each ministry
- The impact when one dominates in isolation
- The effect when fully integrated with the others

### Comparative Overview of APEST Ministries

| Ministry   | Core Tasks/Functions | Impact When Integrated | Impact When Isolated/Unhealthy |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **Apostolic** | Steward DNA, extend/found, pioneer, network | Healthy movement, innovation, growth | Autocracy, woundedness, instability |
| **Prophetic** | Hear/speak for God, truth-telling, challenge status quo | Obedience, social justice, faithfulness | Factiousness, exclusivity, over-spiritualizing |
| **Evangelistic** | Recruit, communicate gospel, call to faith | Growth, vision, expansion | Narrow vision, “simple gospel” only |
| **Shepherding** | Nurture, lead, develop community | Discipleship, connectedness, worship | Closed system, co-dependency, passivity |
| **Teaching** | Clarify, guide, discern, instill wisdom | Understanding, integration, truth | Dogmatism, gnosticism, intellectualism |

*(For a visual matrix of APEST leadership and ministry, see referenced resources.)*

### Ministry as a Complex

Most individuals don’t operate out of a single ministry. Typically, ministry callings are complex, with primary, secondary, and tertiary expressions interacting dynamically. For instance, someone may be primarily prophetic but also gifted in evangelism and teaching.

- **Primary calling**: Main vocational ministry type
- **Secondary/Tertiary callings**: Shape, qualify, and extend the primary type

The clarification of vocational identity is central to one’s purpose. Tools such as the statistically validated APEST profile (see [apest.org](http://www.apest.org)) have helped many discover vocational integrity.

### Defining the List of Ministries

While Ephesians 4 provides a definitive (if not exhaustive) list, the church must not subtract from these five foundational categories. Spiritual gifts empower these ministries as needed; teaching, for example, relies on teaching, wisdom, and revelatory gifts, while the prophetic draws on a different set. All gifts are available as the Spirit wills.

### APEST as a System

The Ephesians 4 text is rich in organic imagery (body, ligaments, head, maturity, fullness). Christian ministry was never intended to be onefold or twofold, but fivefold. Each style is strengthened by the others, and personal development includes growing in secondary giftings.

## The Synergy of APEST: One Plus One Equals Three or More

> *“Just as the various systems in the human body (e.g., circulatory, nervous, digestive) work together to sustain and enhance life, so too in all living systems the various elements in the system interrelate and serve to augment one another. Dysfunction is the result of a breakdown between various components or agents within the system.”*

When all five ministries function together, the body of Christ operates at peak—growing, maturing, building itself up, and reaching unity in faith.

### Practical Application: APEST in Leadership Teams

At South Melbourne Restoration Community, leadership was intentionally restructured so that all five ministries were represented. Each led a functional team:

- **Apostolic:** Translocal, missional, strategic, experimental issues
- **Prophetic:** Listening to God, discerning his will, social justice
- **Evangelistic:** Evangelism and outreach programs
- **Shepherding:** Community building, worship, counseling, love capacity
- **Teaching:** Learning contexts, Bible study, philosophical discussion

This model operated as an open learning system:
- **Fit:** Common ethos and purpose (unity)
- **Split:** Diversity of expression (allowing debate/disagreement)
- **Contend:** Encouragement of honest dialogue around core tasks
- **Transcend:** Collectively overcoming disagreement to find new solutions

Such an environment stimulated more faithful solutions—true to calling, sensitive to outsiders, sustainable, mature, and theologically grounded.

### Hierarchical vs. Open APEST Systems

Traditional hierarchical models are often led by shepherds and teachers and may stifle real participation and interaction, causing members to feel silenced. A bottom-up APEST approach creates a dynamic learning system: outward-looking ministries (A, P, E) bring in external information and drive innovation, while sustaining ministries (S, T) ensure stability.

## APEST in Practice

APEST thinking is being widely tested and adopted at local, denominational, and international levels, with structures developed for assessment and training (e.g., ECO Presbyterians, Mennonite Church, Four Square North America, Netherdutch Reformed Church of Africa).

> *“No church bureaucrat can ever take out what Jesus has put in. We have no need to import APEST into Jesus’s ecclesia—we need only to awaken it.”*

## Metaphor and Movement: From Monument to Movement

> *“Metaphors and symbols are not just used to illustrate an idea; they actually contain the very idea they are meant to convey. They are much more effective means of communication than the more discursive logical forms of language.”*

Shifting from static-institutional metaphors (e.g., "church as institution or monument") to dynamic-organic ones (e.g., "church as body, field, yeast, movement") profoundly changes the way we see and experience church. To awaken Apostolic Genius, we must change the paradigm from institution to movement.

## Re-enchanting Ecclesiology: The Creator Comes to Church

The organic images of the church are rooted in the doctrine of creation. All life is imbued with God’s creative intelligence. The design of the church should mirror the interconnected, dynamic, and self-organizing systems found in creation. The church is not merely an organization but a living organism—filled with the sacred mystery of divine life.

## Movement Thinking and Organic Systems

Understanding the church as a living system is key to releasing transformative power. In dynamic systems, all elements are interrelated and interdependent. Releasing the potential of apostolic movements requires activating all the elements of mDNA (missional DNA):

1. Radical commitment to Jesus’ way
2. Vision for discipleship and active disciple-making
3. Commitment to extend the movement cross-culturally
4. Missional ministry and leadership
5. Structures that empower every member, emphasizing reproducibility and scalability
6. Willingness to take risks for the movement

## Removing Barriers: Dealing with Movement Killers in Institutionalism

Recovering organic systems is not about anarchism or being anti-institutional. Movements require structure for sustainability—but structure exists to serve the movement, not the other way around.

Beware of institutionalism:
- Institutions initially serve a vital function but may become ends in themselves.
- Bureaucratic institutionalism prioritizes conformity, routine, and the status quo—stifling creativity, dissent, and innovation.
- Transformative church culture requires less procedural control and more relational and ethical accountability anchored in common vision and values.

> *“The key to unfreezing the church to be with Jesus on the mission field is to view our congregations and denominations as the roots and shoots of an ‘organic movement’ that goes far beyond organizational survival.”*  
> *—Bill Easum, Unfreezing Moves*

Institutional conformity, in seeking stability, often undermines mission. Movement thinking offers a way forward—restoring the dynamic, living reality Jesus originally embedded in his church.
