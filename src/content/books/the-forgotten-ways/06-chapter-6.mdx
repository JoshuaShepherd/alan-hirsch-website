---# Discipleship as a Core Practice in Missional Movements

> "We must become holy not because we want to feel holy but because Christ must be able to live his life fully in us."  
> — Mother Teresa

Discipleship stands at the heart of all vibrant missional movements. It is both the entry point and the sustaining force behind movements such as the Wesleyan, Franciscan, or the Chinese house church phenomenon. At their core, these movements consist of committed disciples who understand the mandate to make disciples.

## Historical Examples: Lessons from Movement History

### The Methodist Movement

Consider the Methodist movement, founded in 18th-century Britain by John Wesley. After a transformative encounter with God, Wesley devoted himself to the conversion and discipling of a nation and the renewal of a fallen church, seeking "no less than the recovery of the truth, life and power of earliest Christianity and the expansion of that kind of Christianity." Within a generation, Methodism claimed one in thirty Britons and became a worldwide phenomenon.  

According to missiologist Stephen Addison, Methodism's success stemmed from the high level of commitment demanded from its participants. However, growth ceased when two "movement killers" were introduced:

1. **Professionalization of Ministry:** In 1850, Methodists required four years of ordination studies for all ministers to counter criticism from other denominations. Growth halted immediately.
2. **Optional Discipleship:** A decade later, discipleship (through classes and bands) became optional, accelerating decline.

These changes shifted Methodism from a dynamic movement to an institution marked by legalism rather than mission.

# The Call to Radical Discipleship

For followers of Jesus, discipleship is not a preliminary step to a spiritual career; it is the fulfillment of our destiny. However, contemporary Western churches rarely make space for radical discipleship. It is often relegated to new converts and even then treated as optional.

Challenges contributing to this include:

- Lack of clear definitions and processes
- A reduction of discipleship to mere intellectual assent
- Rampant consumerism, undermining the call to follow Jesus

As a result, participation in the Christian community is often reduced to the lowest common denominator. Yet, significant missional movements contradict this trend, maintaining high expectations for discipleship.

### Early Christian Movements

By AD 170, the underground Christian movement implemented rigorous catechisms. Prospective converts, already risking death due to persecution, were subjected to thorough personal examinations to determine their readiness for baptism and community membership. Many were turned away for being unworthy—a stark contrast to today’s “seeker-sensitive” practices. When membership standards declined post-Constantine, the church was inundated with worldliness.

> See Kreider, *Change of Conversion*; Webber, *Journey to Jesus*; and Hirsch, *Disciplism* for more on early catechisms and discipleship.

## Contemporary Models of Discipleship

### Church Multiplication Associates (CMA)

Neil Cole, founder of CMA, emphasizes a simple church model with high discipleship standards:

> "We want to lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple."  
> — Neil Cole

CMA’s success, growing to 500 churches in a few years, revolves around their Life Transformation Groups (LTGs)—small groups focused on Bible reading, storytelling, accountability, and prayer. Every participant, regardless of leadership status, joins an LTG as an ongoing practice.

### Soma Communities and NewThing Network

- **Soma Communities:** Prioritize communal discipleship and individual practices. Regular attendance is de-emphasized in favor of authentic disciple-making.
- **NewThing Network:** Focuses on apprenticing and leadership development. Leadership is accessible only through apprenticeship—learning by doing and teaching others.

## The Challenge of Consumerism

### The New Missional Context

Discipleship is always articulated against competing claims for allegiance. Historically, Christians defied Caesar’s demands for political loyalty. In modern Western contexts, consumerism—a quasi-religion offering identity, purpose, and community—poses the greatest threat.  

Advertisers co-opt religious language and symbols, making their products gateways to meaning and community. The church, in turn, is pressured to operate as a vendor, while congregants become mere consumers.

**Symptoms of Consumerism in the Church:**

- Passive audiences entertained by professionals
- Programs designed for convenience and comfort
- Attractional models fueling consumerist expectations

> "We simply cannot consume our way into discipleship. Consumerism and discipleship are simply at odds with each other."  
> — Alan Hirsch

### Countercultural Responses

Emerging responses include missional and monastic orders such as the Mustard Seed Order (originators of the 24-7 Prayer Movement) and Rutba House, which follow new monasticism:

#### Marks of New Monasticism (Rutba House):

1. Relocating to abandoned city places
2. Sharing resources with the needy
3. Practicing hospitality
4. Lamenting racial divisions and seeking reconciliation
5. Submission to the church
6. Intentional spiritual formation
7. Supporting celibate singles and monogamous families
8. Living in geographical proximity
9. Stewarding creation and supporting local economies
10. Pursuing peacemaking

Other examples include the Eden Project (UK), InnerChange (USA, SE Asia, South Africa), Urban Neighbors of Hope (Australia, Thailand), and Incedo (New Zealand).

## The Conspiracy of “Little Jesus”

> "Discipleship is determined by relation to Christ himself, not by mere conformity to impersonal commands."  
> — David Bosch

The essence of discipleship is to become like Jesus—to embody his life, teachings, and mission so thoroughly that there are “little Jesuses” throughout the world. This is not mere imitation; it is Christ living in us and through us, manifested in every aspect of daily existence.

Paul expresses this concept:

> "You became imitators of us and of the Lord... So you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. The Lord’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere."  
> — 1 Thess. 1:6–9

### Embodiment and Transmission

Discipleship means not just teaching ideas but embodying the gospel in community. Movements like those begun by St. Francis or Count Zinzendorf thrived because leaders and members gave flesh to their message.

#### Scriptural Mandate for Embodied Discipleship

- *Philippians 3:17*: “Join together in following my example...”
- *2 Thessalonians 3:9*: “...to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.”
- *Titus 2:7–8*: “In everything set them an example by doing what is good.”
- *1 Corinthians 11:1*: “Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.”

Without this embodiment—*the medium is the message*—movements fail to ignite or persist.

## Embedding Discipleship: Practices and Models

Contemporary missional movements are refocusing on discipleship as core practice, utilizing new tools, habits, and cultural liturgies:

- **BELLS Model** (Michael Frost)
- **BLESS Practices** (NewThing Network)
- **Eat, Listen, Story, Bless, Celebrate, ReCreate** (Soma Network)
- **LifeShapes** (3DM/Sheffield, UK; now global)
- **100M** (development of missional practices and tools)

> See Frost, *Five Habits of Highly Missional People*; Brisco and Ford, *Missional Quest*; Ferguson and Ferguson, *Discover Your Mission Now*.

## Inspirational Leadership: "Be the Change You Want to See"

> "George Bush has power; Mother Teresa had authority!"  
> — Steve McKinnon

True missional leadership flows from discipleship. Leaders like Gandhi—who never held official office—transformed societies through moral and spiritual authority, not institutional power. Similarly, Jesus held no earthly titles, yet altered the course of history through the integrated power of his life and teachings.

**Characteristics of Inspirational/Moral Leadership:**

- Rooted in personal integrity and spiritual authority
- Inspirational rather than institutional
- Emerges from embodying the message rather than wielding external power

Paul, in defending his ministry, points not to ordination but to his life, sufferings, and deep connection to Christ (2 Cor. 1:1; Gal. 1:1).

---

## Leadership as an Extension of Discipleship

The quality of church leadership is directly proportional to the quality of discipleship. Leadership is always secondary; discipleship is primary. Without making self-initiating, reproducing, devoted disciples, movements cannot multiply.

> “If you can’t reproduce disciples, you can’t reproduce leaders. If you can’t reproduce leaders, you can’t reproduce churches. If you can’t reproduce churches, you can’t reproduce movements.”
> — Neil Cole

Jesus modeled this by immersing his disciples in mission from the outset—proclaiming the kingdom, serving the poor, healing, and casting out demons—a pattern evident in all great movements.

## Recovering a Biblical Pattern: The Limits of the Academy

Traditional Western leadership training often removes trainees from the context of ordinary life and ministry, emphasizing information transfer rather than life-on-life discipleship. This leads to a leadership deficit ill-suited to the adaptive challenges of the 21st-century church.

### Two Contrasting Approaches to Learning

| Greek (Hellenistic) Model      | Hebraic (Discipleship) Model     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Information/Ideas              | Action/Reflection                 |
| Classroom and Books            | Embodiment/Mentoring/Modeling     |
| Right thinking → Right acting  | Right acting → Right thinking     |

- The Greek model: Attempt to *think our way into a new way of acting*.  
- The Hebraic model: *Act our way into a new way of thinking*.

Discipleship requires whole-person formation, cultivated in the context of real life, with an emphasis on action-reflection and embodied practice.

## Conclusion: A Way Forward

The most promising developments in the missional movement involve a renewed commitment to disciple making through:

- *Action-learning discipleship*
- *Embedding core practices and habits*
- *Creating communities with high expectations of spiritual maturity*

Movements like Forge Mission Training Network exemplify this by immersing interns in challenging, real-life environments. Such approaches draw on the ancient wisdom of Jesus' own method—forming disciples in the crucible of mission, obedience, and community.

> — Alan Hirsch (following Pascale, Millemann, & Gioja, *Surfing the Edge of Chaos*)
