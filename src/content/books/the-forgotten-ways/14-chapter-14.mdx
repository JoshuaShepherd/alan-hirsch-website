---> **“Liquid modernity,” a term coined by Zygmunt Bauman, describes the unpredictable, constantly changing nature of contemporary society. The church, argues Pete Ward, must adapt to this fluid environment or risk irrelevance.**

## Appendix 5: Engaging Liquid Modernity

Ward asserts that the transformation of the “solid church” into what he describes as heritage, refuge, and nostalgic communities has significantly diminished the church’s effectiveness in fulfilling its true mission in the era of liquid modernity. According to Ward:

> “The mutation of solid church into heritage, refuge, and nostalgic communities has seriously decreased its ability to engage in genuine mission in liquid modernity.”<sup>2</sup>

The church increasingly finds itself isolated from the wider culture, which has resulted in what Ward calls a damaging alteration to its "gospel genetic code." The church in its solidified, institutional form resists cultural change and, in doing so, becomes inadvertently shaped by it—usually in ways that are neither planned nor beneficial.

By addressing only the internal, often insular religious needs of its members, the church has failed to connect with the broader spiritual hunger found among not-yet-Christians. Ward continues:

> “The mutant genetic code within these kinds of churches means that they are a poor starting point for a new kind of church that connects with the flow of spiritual hunger evident in our societies.”<sup>3</sup>

Ward’s analysis highlights the need for churches to engage liquid modernity with what he calls a **liquid form of church**.

### The Necessity of Liquid Church

Liquid church is essential because it takes contemporary culture seriously and seeks to express the Christian gospel fully within this context. At its core, the liquid church is a living, adaptive network that is highly responsive to the spiritual needs and hunger of the surrounding society.

Ward suggests that liquid church, as he defines it, more closely resembles the model of church advocated in the New Testament. This is not just because it is missional and contextually responsive, nor merely because it is structurally more in line with biblical ecclesiology, but also because it reworks the doctrines of what it means to be “in Christ” and “the body of Christ” in light of the current missional scenario.

Ward writes:

> “It is clear that the church in Corinth was distinctly different in structure and ethos from the church in Jerusalem, yet they were both legitimate expressions of the body of Christ. There is little in the way of uniform structure in the New Testament church. The reality of the church is to be found only ‘in Christ.’ ‘Christ is our origin and our truth. To be a Christian is to be joined to Christ and to be joined to Christ is to be joined to his church.’”<sup>4</sup>

Thus, being joined to Christ defines what it means to be a Christian and a part of his church. The expression of this relationship varies according to the missional context. In a fluid, ever-shifting culture, Ward argues, we need a liquid form of church that can authentically express what it means to be “in Christ.”<sup>5</sup>

## Liquid Versus Solid Church

To be joined to Christ is, inherently, to be joined to the body of Christ. This corporate, embodied perspective is fundamental to any theology of the church. However, it’s important to distinguish between these two statements:

- The body of Christ is the church.
- The church is the body of Christ.

Ward contends that we should focus on the way our connection to Christ makes us part of the body, rather than the other way around.<sup>6</sup> Too often, we identify the concrete, historical expressions of the church as the body of Christ, thereby confining the concept to a singular institutional form. Ward highlights that while this identification holds a degree of truth, the greater truth is that the **body of Christ** can be expressed in multiple forms and contexts—opening up space for diverse expressions of church.

The distinction is paradigmatic. By recognizing it, we free ourselves from the restrictive grip of the institutional church model, enabling us to reimagine what it means to be God’s people in the contemporary world.

### How Might Liquid Church Express Itself?

Ward notes:

> “All liquids are characterized by flow.”<sup>7</sup>

Solids are fixed and unmoving, defined by “fixing space” and “binding time”—that is, by resisting change. In contrast, if we are to envision a liquid church, movement and change must be fundamental characteristics:

> “We need to let go of a static model of church that is based primarily on congregation, programs, and buildings. In its place we need to develop a notion of Christian community, worship, mission, and organization which, like the New Testament ecclesia, is more flexible, adaptive, and responsive to change.”<sup>8</sup>

The New Testament church, rather than resembling the solid, hierarchical structures that later developed, functioned more like a fluid network.

## Glossary of Key Terms

To assist readers in navigating some of the more technical terms and concepts, the following glossary provides definitions critical to understanding this work.

### Adaptive Challenge
- **Concept Origin:** Chaos theory.
- **Definition:** A situation confronting a living system that necessitates finding a new reality in response to significant threat (“adapt or die”) or compelling opportunity.
- **Relevance:** Sets the stage for innovation and adaptation; requires adaptive leadership in times of threat or opportunity compared to operational leadership.

### Adaptive Leader
- **Definition:** One who develops learning organizations capable of agility, responsiveness, innovation, and entrepreneurship during periods of threat or opportunity.

---

### APEST
- **Acronym:** Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher.
- **Usage:** Describes the fivefold ministry model from Ephesians 4. Not just a theology of church, but a description of its energy, impulse, genius, and leadership structure.

### Apostolic Genius
- **Definition:** The unique force energizing Jesus movements. Comprised of six (at minimum) components:
  - Jesus is Lord
  - Missional-incarnational impulse
  - APEST culture
  - Disciple making
  - Organic systems
  - Communitas
- **Activation:** When all elements are present and dynamically related, and catalyzed by an adaptive challenge.

---

### Attractional Church
- **Definition:** Operates on the assumption that attracting people to church is prerequisite to leading them to Jesus. Central institutional mode during Christendom, encouraging a “come and hear” rather than “go-to-them” approach.

---

### Biblical Hebraic/Hebraic Worldview
- **Definition:** The worldview foundational to and sustained by biblical revelation.

### Chaos and Chaos Theory
- **Definition:** Scientific discipline examining how living systems—including organizations—respond to their environment; chaos, though threatening, may also foster significant innovation.

---

### Christendom/Constantinianism
- **Definition:** Standardized expression of church and mission post-AD 312, marked by centrality, attractional mode, sacred buildings, formal clergy, and the institutionalization of grace.

> **Key Characteristics:**
> - Attractional mode vs. missional/sending
> - Shift to designated sacred spaces/buildings
> - Emergence of professional clergy
> - Sacraments administered by institutional priesthood

---

### Christocentric/Christology

### Communitas/Liminality
- **Communitas:** Inspired togetherness and community forged around common mission amidst risk and marginality.
- **Liminality:** Boundary or threshold condition from which communitas emerges; characterized by disorientation, danger, and the potential for transformation.

### Complexity (Living-Systems Theory)
- **Definition:** Living organisms self-organize toward greater complexity; small actions can yield significant systemic consequences.

---

### mDNA (Movement DNA)
- **Definition:** The intrinsic guiding mechanism necessary for the sustainability of missional movements, paralleling DNA in biological systems. Consists of:
