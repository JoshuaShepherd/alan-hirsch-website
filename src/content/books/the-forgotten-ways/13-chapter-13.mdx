---# A Crash Course in Chaos  
## Principles for Adaptive, Missional Leadership

> "What didn’t kill them served to make them stronger."

Throughout Christian history, periods of instability and danger have consistently fostered vigor and resilience among believers—qualities often absent in more stable, static periods. Early Christians did not live in an artificial “churchy fishbowl,” but embodied *ecclesia* in all facets of life, even the most dangerous. This dynamic environment, akin to our own immune system, built fortitude through adversity.

Brian McLaren, a prominent voice in the United States' emerging church movement, recommends that churches cultivate adaptability as a core value. In other words:

> “Change your church’s attitude towards change... everything else will change as it should.”  
> — Brian McLaren, _Church on the Other Side_

He has devised a test (mPULSE) to assess missional fitness based on six elements of mDNA ([see here](http://www.theforgottenways.org)), highlighting the need for agility. Similarly, Tom Peters, in _Thriving on Chaos_, argues that valuing change itself is vital for success in chaotic contexts. He provides actionable models for developing a “love of change” throughout business practice.

In this book, we term this trait **missional fitness**: the capacity for the church to embrace agility and responsiveness in its core philosophy and operations.

## Principle #2: Surfing the Edge of Chaos

It is striking that *theologically fertile* sections of the Bible are always set amidst chaos, danger, or significant transition: Abraham’s call, the exodus and exile, David’s adventures, Jeremiah’s struggles, Jesus’s ministry, and the Book of Acts. None of these were static ecosystems—they were dynamic, even perilous.

This feature is prominently embedded in the mDNA of *communitas*, the type of deep community formed in shared adventure and risk.

### The Edge of Chaos in Living Systems

The study of living systems reveals that **nature is most innovative near the edge of chaos**. Rather than a specific location, the “edge of chaos” is a permeable, in-between state—an environment where order and disorder intersect and flow.

**Key Characteristics:**
- The edge is not an abyss; it is the “sweet spot” for productive change.
- Productive agitation and high tension often spur innovation and breakthroughs.
- This critical state is sometimes dubbed a “burning platform.” The living sciences call it the edge of chaos.

#### The Role of Leadership

Adaptive leadership, as articulated by Heifetz, does not push a system over the edge but approaches the edge to face real challenges—those that, ignored, would eventually destroy the organization.

> "If people in the organization never seriously face the problem and stay with it for a considerable length of time, they will never feel the need to find a genuine and lasting solution."

At Forge, we teach interns:  
> "Sell the problem before you try evoking a solution."  
It is here, at the edge of chaos, that real innovation occurs.

When the SMRC church operated on the fringes, it adapted through several leaps. Once it sought stability and drifted from the edge, decline set in. Generally, churches, especially historical denominations, become conservative and routinized—institutions oriented backward rather than envisioning the future.

As Upton Sinclair observed:

> "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it."  
> — Upton Sinclair, _I, Candidate for Governor_

Stagnant systems cannot see or solve their problems. As a result, many become closed, institutionalized systems, incapable of responding to the adaptive challenges of the age. Theological liberalism, often arising in later stages of a movement, further signals institutional decline by minimizing necessary Gospel-culture tension and offering little innovation.

To reverse this, leaders must responsibly "turn the heat up"—increasing urgency without chaos—to find authentic, missional expressions of being God’s people.

## Principle #3: Self-Organization and Emergence

Self-organization and emergence are two sides of a central principle in living systems:

- **Self-organization**: On the edge of chaos, interconnected elements can spontaneously generate entirely new, more complex states of order (e.g., proteins to cells, cells to organs, organs to organisms, organisms to societies).
- **Emergence**: Most change in complex systems is emergent, arising from free, informal interactions among “agents” (people) in the system. With sufficient connectivity, new patterns and structures appear spontaneously.

> "The answers to the challenges faced by organisms and organizations in changing environments tend to emerge from the bottom up, rather than being planned before hand from the top down."  
> — Roxburgh and Romanuk, “Christendom Thinking”

Missional leadership, then, is the cultivation of environments where the missional imagination—and, more critically, the Apostolic Genius—latent in God’s people may emerge.

### Examples of Emergence
- The Internet: Millions of interconnected computers create emergent, unpredictable phenomena and new “life.”
- Ant colonies: Individually weak ants form complex, adaptive superorganisms.
- Jazz ensembles: Collective improvisation yields a “whole” greater than the sum of its parts.

Adam Smith, in pioneering economics, termed this the “invisible hand”—an emergent social force beyond individual choices.

## Principle #4: Disturbing Complexity

Merely making existing organizations more efficient rarely produces true innovation. Such **optimization** only entrenches a system in its present paradigm.

> "Optimization founders because efforts to direct living systems, beyond very general goals, are counterproductive... Like herding the proverbial butterfly, living things can be ushered forth... but in their own unique way."  
> — Pascale, Millemann, and Gioja, _Surfing the Edge of Chaos_

SMRC's youthful community, for example, could not be controlled or predicted (like herding cats), leading to creative breakthroughs through constant readjustment.

On the “fitness landscape,” one cannot move to a higher fitness peak simply by optimizing the current one; radical innovation requires *descending into the unknown* and embarking on a journey of sequential disturbances and adaptations—not adhering rigidly to a predetermined path.

---

## The Disciplines of Agility

> "Having breathed new life into organizations, how do we sustain it? Paradoxically, the answer lies in 'disciplines.'"  
> — Pascale, Millemann, and Gioja

At SMRC, these were our “practices.” Such disciplines help organizations thrive near chaos and foster self-organization. The authors identify seven critical disciplines to sustain an agile, adaptive learning organization:

1. **Infuse an intricate understanding of what drives organizational success.**
2. **Insist on uncompromising straight talk.**
3. **Manage from the future.**
4. **Reward inventive accountability.**
5. **Harness adversity by learning from prior mistakes.**
6. **Foster relentless discomfort.**
7. **Cultivate reciprocity between the individual and the organization.**

Each discipline is powerful on its own, but their synergy delivers the greatest impact.

## How, Then, Shall We Live?

Though technical, this paradigm of organic leadership and living systems offers fresh insight. It is liberating to know that God does not intend for leaders to have all the answers and vision. Instead, leaders help God’s people discover answers through awakening imagination and prompting a search.

Our role shifts from controllers to cultivators—creating environments for new growth and movement to arise (see Chapter 8, "APEST Culture").

---

## A Case Study in Emergent Structures: "Come Forth!"

The Biblical creation narrative itself is a story of emergence: God calls forth life and order from primal chaos. New forms of church and mission community today parallel this archetype. The rise of the missional movement is not just a trend, but the natural emergence of new, adaptive forms of Christian community.

### Moving Out of Equilibrium: The Adaptive Challenge

The Western church finds itself in adaptive crisis; Christendom's legacy has left most churches unable to respond to the rapid, fluid, and open spiritual environment of our time.

#### Signs of Change

- A massive spiritual quest pervades Western society, yet people rarely turn to the church.
- Spiritual openness in culture is at a high not seen for centuries, but the church is often invisible.
- As a result, the "window of opportunity" for mission is limited, especially as Western culture quickly consumes new fads.

If churches do not recalibrate, many will be swept away. Traditional, institutional forms are slow and unresponsive (like a supertanker); adaptive, agile communities (speedboats) are required.

Tom Peters notes similar trends in business: organizations with unwieldy structure face “management’s time bomb.” The most responsive—often smaller—organizations will thrive.

#### Emergence and Self-Organization in Missional Church

Emergence occurs as diverse movements—missional theology, cross-cultural missions, urban mission, evangelical theology, Pentecostalism, radical discipleship, alternative worship, and post-evangelicalism—interact and cross-fertilize. The results are new, adaptive forms of church with deep roots in apostolic patterns.

For example, Pentecostal and charismatic streams, though once missing from missional innovation, are now contributing through restructuring and new leadership voices.

## Leadership: CEO or Servant?

When reclaiming the apostolic in contemporary ministry, the key issue is not charismatic authority, but **servant leadership** rooted in the character of Christ. Apostolic gifting, as outlined in Ephesians 4 (not 1 Corinthians 12-14), is Christological and shaped by the cross.

> "The greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves."  
> — Luke 22:25–27

Hierarchical, CEO-style leadership is often compared to the Morton Bay fig tree: magnificent, but casting a shadow under which nothing else grows. Such styles can disempower and weaken the organization once the leader departs.

**Empowering Leadership** instead:
- Calls forth and develops the gifts of all God’s people.
- Moves from top-down dominance to catalyzing latent potential.
- Employs relational, bottom-up influence.

Jim Collins (_Good to Great_) confirms that charismatic, dominant leaders frequently hinder organizations from true greatness; the most effective leaders awaken and mobilize what is already latent in the community.

It is the role of the apostolic leader, under the Holy Spirit, to call out what God already placed in the system—a dance that is choreographed as it unfolds.

## Vital Metaphors for Missional Leadership

Powerful images help us avoid the trap of hierarchical models:
- **The Midwife:** The leader's role is akin to a midwife—creating the right conditions for birth, not controlling the process itself.
- **The Farmer:** Like a farmer, leaders prepare, nurture, and trust growth processes beyond their total control, in reliance on God.

These organic metaphors root leadership in life’s rhythms, aligning more closely with biblical and ecological images of church (seeds, body, flock, trees, yeast, etc.).

## Appendix Summaries

### Appendix 3: A Living Example—Third Place Communities (TPC)

**Third Place Communities** exemplify the missional-incarnational impulse. In Hobart, Australia, TPC “is church wherever they are”—in cafes, pubs, and community spaces. Their missional rhythm includes hospitality, service, shared life events, art, music, spiritual dialogue, and rites of passage.

**Key Organizational Expressions:**
- **(Re)Verb Mission Community:** Church emerges from mission, shaped by local context.
- **Marketplace:** A neutral space for exploring existential and spiritual themes without proselytizing.
- **Weddings, Parties, Anything:** Rites of passage deepen relationships and open natural doors for spirituality.
- **Imagine Tasmania:** A collaborative project to envision social renewal, engaging believers and nonbelievers alike in shared purpose.

### Appendix 4: Leadership in Living Systems

A *living-systems approach* structures organizational life in accordance with the rhythms of nature:

**Key Observations:**
- All living things carry innate, distributed intelligence.
- Life is profoundly interconnected—nothing exists in isolation.
- “Butterfly effect”: Small changes can trigger systemic shifts.
- Free flow of information and healthy relationships drive adaptation and growth.
- Adaptive challenges, when embraced, unlock the potential for emergence and learning.

**Application to Church Life:**
- Every gathering of God’s people contains latent resources to thrive in any setting.
- Cultivate relationships and cross-pollinate gifts, not rigid institutions.
- Move deliberately to the edge of chaos; address real issues without denial.
- Shape, rather than control, the flow of information—letting the system respond and order itself around meaningful narratives and tasks.

Organic, networked models align with biblical metaphors and allow communities to truly function as the body of Christ in dynamic, everyday life.

### Appendix 5: Liquid versus Solid Church

Peter Ward’s _Liquid Church_ contrasts the “solid,” institutional church with “liquid,” networked community—adapted for Zygmunt Bauman’s analysis of “liquid modernity.” Solid churches emphasize heritage, refuge, and nostalgia; liquid churches are networked, fluid, and responsive to culture.

_The rest of the discussion further explores these metaphors and their implications._
