---# Viral Movement and Reproduction in Missional Communities

> "Eventually we reach a tipping point, a critical mass, and things can take off."  
> —Malcolm Gladwell, *The Tipping Point*

Malcolm Gladwell famously explores how social movements or “epidemics” work in his outstanding book, *The Tipping Point*. In many ways, the gospel travels much like a virus—“sneezed” from one person to another through relationships and networks. The critical element is creating the right conditions: meaningful relationships, relevant communication, new media, an understanding of human spiritual need, and the drive to face the adaptive challenges of our age.

When these conditions combine with the interconnectivity of our global society, the potential for ideas—*ideaviruses*—to spread rapidly is enormous.

## Six Degrees of Separation: Networks and Connectivity

The “six degrees of separation” theory proposes that anyone on the planet can be connected to any other person through a chain of acquaintances involving no more than five intermediaries. American sociologist Stanley Milgram tested this theory by having randomly selected people in the Midwest attempt to send packages to a stranger in Massachusetts. Senders only knew the recipient’s name, occupation, and general location and were instructed to forward the package to the acquaintance most likely to know the recipient personally. This process averaged only six intermediaries, leading to the now-popular term.

The implication: ideaviruses can spread through networks astonishingly quickly. The key factors are:

- Getting the core DNA (central idea or message) right
- Maintaining consistency throughout the chain

The gospel, or mission, as ideavirus, is hyperbolic growth in action. Missional leaders cannot afford to ignore this phenomenon. Addition alone makes reaching the world impossible, but, networked together—with the right message and simplicity—movement can happen organically.

## Reproduction and Reproduce-ability

Before concluding, it’s essential to address reproduction and reproduce-ability. All organic life seeks to reproduce and perpetuate itself. In biology, this happens through **sexual reproduction**—not mere cloning or replication. This distinction matters.

Many church-planting strategies have emulated cloning rather than reproduction, simply duplicating the “mother” church to create a “daughter” church. Unfortunately, this:

- Seeds uniform DNA into each new church community
- Restricts the missional variety needed for maximum impact

But why is reproduction preferable to cloning?

- **Diversity**: Sexual reproduction (through random chromosome pairings) generates far more variety in offspring, enriching and strengthening the organism against threats.
- **Resilience**: Diversity increases adaptability and the ability to face challenges.
- **Uniqueness**: Healthy reproduction creates unique offspring, ensuring ongoing development and survival in variable conditions.

> “Complex adaptive systems become more vulnerable as they become more homogenous. To thwart homogeneity, nature relies on the rich structural recombination triggered by sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction maximizes diversity.”  
> —*Pascale, Millemann, and Gioja, Surfing the Edge of Chaos*

An inbred genetic pool leads to weaknesses and deformities. Cloning does not provide the necessary diversity; reproduction through variety invigorates the system.

### Reproduce-ability: Built-In Capacity

Another crucial factor is **reproduce-ability**—the capacity for living systems to perpetuate themselves through simple, replicable processes.

- This principle must be embedded in the initial model (the “mDNA” or missional DNA of the church).
- Movements must:
    - Be simple yet adaptable
    - Encourage genetic exchange with other movements while maintaining core identity
    - Foster both uniqueness and consistency

David Garrison succinctly observes:

> “If you want to see churches planted, then you must set out to plant churches. If you want to see reproducing churches planted, then you must set out to plant reproducing churches.”
> —*Church Planting Movements*

This means the initiating DNA must inherently allow for adaptable, diverse, yet consistent communities.

### Simplicity Yields Multiplication

Early church and Chinese underground movements exemplify how **simplicity** fosters multiplication under pressure. In times of persecution, old complexities and institutional burdens fall away, leaving only what matters most—the irreducible minimum of faith and practice.

> “Gone were the beloved institutions, buildings, and public worship services; the church was forced to discover itself anew in utter, uncluttered simplicity.”

This simplicity enabled the Russian Baptist church under Stalin, for example, to reemerge as a movement of thousands after decades underground.

The lesson: in rapidly changing or hostile environments, the essentials of faith must be easily transmitted—simple enough to be “sneezed.”

### The Challenge of Attractional and Institutional Models

The prevalent “attractional” or megachurch model, with its highly resourced professional departments and charismatic leaders, is not inherently wrong. However:

- **It is not easily reproduced** by ordinary believers.
- **It marginalizes** the vast majority from ministry and multiplication.
- **It risks stifling potential movements**, requiring professionalization and resources out of reach for most.

Most of the 350,000 churches in the United States have fewer than 80 members. Attempting to replicate the largest, most complex models sets unrealistic standards and stifles reproducibility.

Similarly, the seminary—while valuable—is generally irreproducible at the grassroots, especially under pressure or in rapidly changing contexts. Leadership development and theologizing historically belonged within the movement itself, not outsourced to separate institutions.

### Diversity and Organic Reproduction

Successful multiplication requires genetic (internal) variety. Curtis Sergeant notes the Chinese underground church maximizes variety by **forming new communities** with every new convert, rather than assimilating everyone into one gathering.

Even megachurches that plant often clone themselves rather than foster diversity, resulting in low sustainability and adaptability.

Institutionalized, mechanistic models must be challenged if we are to adapt to the realities and opportunities of the twenty-first century. As Bill Broussard puts it:

> “Revitalization is all in the setup.”

We must get the DNA right from the start—clarity at the beginning and consistency throughout the lifecycle are vital. Only then will history be made as organic systems meet genuine movement ethos, exponential reproduction, and networked growth.

# Conclusion

> "A church which pitches its tents without constantly looking out for new horizons, which does not continually strike camp, is being untrue to its calling.... [We must] play down our longing for certainty, accept what is risky, and live by improvisation and experiment."  
> —Hans Küng, *The Church as the People of God*

> "We shall not cease from exploration  
> And the end of all our exploring  
> Will be to arrive where we started  
> And know the place for the first time"  
> —T. S. Eliot, “Little Gidding”

Rediscovering **Apostolic Genius** is like uncovering a forgotten treasure—one long hidden in the cluttered archives of tradition. By returning to the primal roots and distilling the faith to its irreducible minimum, we recover a power and vitality for mission that is timeless.

Apostolic Genius offers the church a mirror, challenging us to compare our current practices against the exemplary Jesus movements of history. It is a call—at once dangerous and hopeful—for radical, systemic, and paradigm-changing adaptation.

My conviction is that Apostolic Genius is **already present** in the church. It is not something alien to impose but a latent potential to awaken and cultivate. The seed of the future is in the womb of the present. Now is the time to adapt faithfully to our ever-changing world, embracing the continuous journey of discovery and improvisation.

# Tools for Missional Assessment

Two tools can aid your journey:

1. **APEST Assessment**:  
   Evaluate yourself or your ministry team in terms of Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Shepherding, and Teaching capacities.
   
2. **mPULSE Test**:  
   Assess the level of Apostolic Genius (and its mDNA components) manifesting in your community.

# A Final Word from Karl Barth

> "No, the church’s existence does not always have to possess the same form in the future that it possessed in the past as though this were the only possible pattern. ... Yes, the hour may strike, and perhaps has already struck, when God, to our discomfiture ... will put an end to this mode of existence because it lacks integrity. ... Yes, as the Church of God we may depend on it that if only we are attentive, God will show us such new ways as we can hardly anticipate now."  
> —Karl Barth, “Letter to a Pastor”

The uncovering of Apostolic Genius is an invitation to risk, to adventure, and to radical faith in the one who calls and sends us. This is the heart of *The Forgotten Ways*—to live in the light of what God has already placed within his people for the hope and transformation of the world.

# Afterword

I first encountered Alan Hirsch not in person but through his book *The Shaping of Things to Come*. Though I hadn’t yet met Alan or heard his name, his writing resonated with the vision and practices my wife and I were pioneering in our church plant.

Alan is a learner—a tireless, humble, and prophetic voice. Over the years, *The Forgotten Ways* has been a touchstone for me, reminding me of the ancient truth that church is not a building or an institution, but the people of God on the mission of God in the everyday stuff of life.

This new edition continues to challenge and awaken the church to our true identity and calling: to be the people reborn by the Spirit, imprinted with the eternal DNA of God, joining in his mission in the world. Alan’s life and work stir hearts to remember and to reawaken what has always been true in Christ.

As disciples who make disciples, our job is not to add something foreign, but to help draw out what is already there—to live into our mDNA, the forgotten yet ever-present ways of Jesus Christ our Savior, Lord, and King.

# Appendix 1: A Crash Course in Chaos Management

> "Expertise has become the creation and control of constants, uniformity, and efficiency, while the need has become the understanding and coordination of variability, complexity, and effectiveness."
> —Dee Hock, *Birth of the Chaordic Age*

> "There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle."
> —Albert Einstein

## Facing Adaptive Challenges

The Western church is facing what systems theory calls an **adaptive challenge**: situations that demand change and adaptation for survival, arising from threat, opportunity, or both. Our threats are less about persecution and more about rapid, discontinuous change on every front—political, cultural, technological, religious.

Just a few decades ago, the future could be forecast with reasonable certainty. Now, unpredictable and rapid change is the norm. The institutional church, designed for stability and slow change, must therefore adapt or risk irrelevance.

## From Newtonian Predictability to Quantum Complexity

Our understanding of organizations has been shaped by a **mechanistic, Newtonian worldview**: strict predictability, linear cause and effect, and centralized control. Yet quantum physics and the science of living systems remind us that reality is much more complex, unpredictable, and interconnected.

- **Mechanistic view**: If we do X, then Y will result.
- **Living systems**: Distributed intelligence, unpredictability, organic adaptation emerge from the “chaos.”

## Changing the Story: Paradigms and Organizational DNA

One reason many efforts at church revitalization fail is that they address only outward structures (“the petals”), rather than the deep systems story—the paradigm—at the heart of the organization.

> “Following Jesus into the mission field is either impossible or extremely difficult...because they have a systems story that will not allow them to take the first step out of the institution into the mission field...”  
> —Bill Easum, *Unfreezing Moves*

For enduring change, the paradigm must change—moving from **Christendom Institution** to an **Organic Jesus Movement** at the center. Ivan Illich argued that:

> "If you want to change a society then you have to tell an alternative story. One so persuasive that it sweeps away old myths and becomes the new preferred story."

## Operational vs. Adaptive Leadership

**Operational Leadership** is suited for stable, predictable environments—maintenance, incremental change, and centralized decision-making.

**Adaptive Leadership** is vital for times of unpredictability, requiring:

- Distributing intelligence throughout the organization
- Recognizing outcomes cannot be fully predicted
- Promoting bottom-up initiative and creative adaptation

The church today needs adaptive leaders—those willing to disturb the stifling equilibrium, ignite imagination and innovation, and help the community navigate stress toward new solutions.

## Four Principles of Living Systems (from *Surfing the Edge of Chaos*)

1. **Equilibrium Is Death**  
    Stability may feel comfortable but stifles innovation and adaptation. Disequilibrium keeps organizations alert, creative, and ready to respond.
2. **Adaptive Activation Over Operational Control**  
    True change emerges from broad, community-based searching rather than top-down implementation.
3. **Cultivate Organizational Variety**  
    Like natural ecosystems, variety in the church enables resilience and capacity to adapt to new threats or opportunities.
4. **Leadership as a Lens**  
    Leaders focus energy and attention, ideally disturbing equilibrium just enough to stimulate innovation and facilitate change.

> "History favors the brave."  
> (Or, as Alfred North Whitehead said, “Without adventure... civilization is in full decay.”)

## In Summary

The future of the church hinges on our ability to recognize, recover, and live out the Apostolic Genius embedded within. It demands:

- A return to mission as the organizing principle of church
- Simple, reproducible forms imbued with diverse, adaptive DNA
- Leaders and communities willing to risk and improvise
- A fresh, organic story at the heart of our shared life

The task for today’s church is not just to survive, but to thrive—by dancing at the edge of chaos, cultivating the forgotten ways of vibrant, faithful, and innovative movement.
