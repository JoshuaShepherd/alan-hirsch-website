---# Breaking the Bondage of Dualism: Toward a Missional-Incarnational Church

> "The tragedy is that everything in this particular medium of church sets Jane up to experience her life as fundamentally dualistic and therefore divided between the sacred and the secular. No one has necessarily intended it to be this way; it’s just as if a virus somehow got into the system, a nasty sucker that has lodged itself in the fundamental programming that underlies the Christendom software."
>
> — *A Journey to the Heart of Apostolic Genius*

## The Dualism in Church Experience

Jane’s experience is all too common. For many Christians, God is not perceived as being “in the world.” The result is a somewhat harrowing spiritual existence: Jane can barely make it to her midweek cell group, where she undergoes an experience similar—but not equal—to Sunday’s. She does have her “quiet times,” in which God sometimes “turns up,” but these are intermittent, and otherwise she feels alone in a spiritually precarious place.

If we’re honest, many of us can recognize ourselves, and our churches, in Jane’s story. The tragedy is that the prevailing church model often leads us into a dualism—a life divided between sacred and secular spheres. No one may have intended this, but it’s as if a virus has crept into the system, distorting the “code” of how church life is practiced.

Regardless of how “seeker-friendly” a service becomes, it frequently communicates this sacred-secular divide, positioning God as the “church God” rather than the God over all of life. As a result, church communities lack a genuine missional edge; they are disconnected from meaningful engagement with the world.

### Effects of Dualistic Church Structure

- **Institutional inertia:** The unspoken message of most church forms cancels out any overtly missional rhetoric.
- **Spiritual failure:** The dualistic spirituality perpetuated by such systems makes it nearly impossible for people to see their work, play, or study as ministry or mission.
- **Ministry as “church work”:** Ministry is relegated to “churchy” tasks handled by experts, thus disempowering the broader community.

## A Missional-Incarnational Reconfiguration

There is an alternative—one that simply involves “reconfiguring” the relationship of God, the world, and the church. In the language of this book, it means becoming **missional-incarnational**, which subsequently engenders *communitas*.

### The Missional Mode: Liminality–Communitas

When the three spheres—God, world, and church—intersect at the center, we have a church that is truly missional, deeply incarnational, and faithfully extending the ministry of Jesus into the world.

In this model:

- **Worship** is always conducted in the context of worldly engagement and therefore must be culturally meaningful to outsiders.
- **Missional edges:** The church is open to everyone, not something apart from the world.
- **Evangelism and social action** are communal activities, undertaken alongside God, who is already present in the world.
- **Holistic spirituality:** Spirituality is an “all-of-life” phenomenon.
- **Ministry redefined:** All parts of life—work, play, study—are seen as part of the church’s mission.

#### "Third Place" Missions

As described in the previous chapter, “third place” missions—where Christians gather in pubs, sports clubs, playgroups, interest groups, and other common public spaces—embody this convergence. Here, the church’s worship and life become necessarily incarnational and culturally sensitive.

> The missional potency of this approach is easily tested: try singing ecstatic choruses in a café or pub. In most cases, it will just alienate the customers and the owner, and you will not be allowed back. But can we worship in the public space? Of course, but we must find ways to connect with God that attract people and spark curiosity.

### Becoming God's People in Public

One of the most missional things a church community can do is simply to **get out of their buildings and go to where the people are**—being God's redeemed people there, in a way that invites others into the experience.

When the three circles intersect, *Apostolic Genius* is ignited. Church becomes the means of integrating all elements of life under one God. The fact is that God is everywhere, already involved in all people’s lives. To move to this model, the church must adjust its position relative to God and the world, breaking free from dualism. A key way to do this is by becoming missional and actively engaging our various cultural contexts.

# Follow the Yellow Brick Road: The Importance of Journey, Risk, and Communitas

The stories of Abraham, sports teams, war veterans, and Tolkien’s *The Lord of the Rings* all teach us the importance of the journey—of movement, risk, and adventure. Deep togetherness and love are found in the shared mission of discovery, communal danger, and survival.

Jesus formed his disciples by inviting them on a journey that led away from comfort and security into liminality, risk, reflection, communitas, and spiritual discovery. As they embraced the adventure, their fears gave way to a courageous faith that changed the world.

> What makes exemplary Jesus movements so dynamic is that they embody movement—not only in organizational structure but in real action. … They had made an abiding decision to enter into the liminality of leaving securities and comforts when they first became Christians, and so didn’t have to factor it in later.

For centuries, institutionalization suppressed this *Apostolic Genius.* But as “people of the Way,” we are invited on a new journey—to rediscover this ancient force.

> The ship is safest in port. But that’s not what ships are made for.

# Liminality and APEST Culture: Missional Leadership for Missional Movements

> “The clergy-laity dichotomy ... is one of the principal obstacles to the church effectively being God’s agent of the Kingdom today because it creates a false idea that only ‘holy men,’ namely, ordained ministers, are really qualified and responsible for leadership and significant ministry.”  
> —Howard Snyder

## APEST: Fivefold Ministry

Over the past decade, study has confirmed the need for a thorough reframing of inherited ministries and leadership. The New Testament describes five categories of ministry:

- **Apostle**
- **Prophet**
- **Evangelist**
- **Shepherd/Pastor**
- **Teacher**

(Collectively known as **APEST**.)

**Missional movements**—those with both exponential growth and transformational impact—require all five APEST functions to be active and engaged.

> Without at least fivefold forms of ministry and leadership, genuine missional movement will not happen. You need at least the five APEST types to start, develop, and maintain a movement.

### The Role of the Apostolic

Of all five, the *apostolic* is most often excluded in the Western church—and it is also the most crucial for our current context. The apostle is uniquely responsible for, and capable of, leading and designing the “sentness” of the church.

The connection is clear: an apostolic mode of ministry leads to apostolic movements. To exclude the apostolic role is to cauterize the church’s missional calling at its root.

## Functions of Apostolic Ministry

### 1. Extends the Movement by Spreading the Gospel
- Embeds mDNA (missional DNA) by pioneering new ground for the gospel and church.

### 2. Safeguards the Movement by Guarding the Gospel
- Maintains theological integrity and ensures churches remain true to the gospel and its ethos.

### 3. Networks the Movement by Maintaining Common Purpose
- Fosters unity, shared meaning, and purpose across diverse expressions of the church.

### 4. Creates the Context for Other APEST Ministries
- Establishes an environment where the other four ministries can emerge and function together.

## Leadership as Field: Influence, Not Office

Authentic apostolic leadership flows not from institutional office but from spiritual authority, calling, and moral inspiration. It is leadership by service, not domination; by inspiration, not coercion.

> The health and maturity of the church are directly related to the fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4. … In *Shaping of Things to Come*, Michael Frost and I call a fully functioning APEST the ‘maturity mechanism’ of the church, because without it we can’t mature.

Inspirational leadership creates a “field”—an environment in which people feel empowered and energized. Great spiritual leaders awaken vision and coherence, drawing their communities toward mission.

## Apostolic Leadership in Practice: Movement over Institution

Leaders like “Uncle L” in China, Mike Breen in the UK and US, and Bob Roberts in Texas exhibit true apostolic influence: they shape movements not by bureaucracy but through personal inspiration, spiritual power, and the forging of webs of shared meaning.

> Apostolic ministry and leadership focus the network of relations on the meaning and implications of the gospel, and on relationships established through it.

Rather than lone rangers, apostles work as part of the body, catalyzing, empowering, and releasing others into their unique callings in God’s mission.

# Conclusion

A missional-incarnational church, structured on the basis of APEST ministry, breaks the limitations of sacred-secular dualism and empowers the whole people of God to participate in mission. Apostolic leadership, marked by servant-inspiration rather than positional authority, is foundational for the birth, growth, and health of genuine movements.

The way forward is clear:  
**Follow the path of liminality, communitas, and apostolic leadership—and rediscover the Apostolic Genius at the heart of the Jesus movement.**
