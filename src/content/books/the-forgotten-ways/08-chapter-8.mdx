## The Perils of Middle-Class Culture for Discipleship

Despite the increased participation of wonderful people, something significant was inadvertently lost as the church culture shifted—becoming more middle class and stable. I concluded there is something about middle-class culture that appears to run contrary to authentic gospel values. Middle-class culture often attenuates the full demands of discipleship. Our own cultural assumptions can function as an “enemy within.” This is not a judgment on middle-class people (I myself am from such a family) but rather a critique of the values and assumptions that seem baked into the deal.

We must be especially aware of cultural values we take for granted because they often become invisible to us. Much of what defines “middle class” is a preoccupation with safety and security, especially as it relates to our children. This is understandable—unless it becomes all-consuming. When these impulses fuse with consumerism, as they often do, an obsession with comfort and convenience is added to the mix. This is not a good combination; certain accepted cultural norms correspond to the Pauline “powers and principalities,” and can undermine the claims of Christ in our lives. All culture—including middle-class culture—is inherently spiritual, for better or worse.

Operating under the influence of these “bugs” in our middle-class software, churches can become purveyors of particularly zesty religious goods and services, competing for the attention of discerning spiritual consumers. Flattered by numerical growth and driven by our own agendas, we thoughtlessly pursue the “gather and amuse” impulse of church-growth theory. We gain transfers from other churches but see the flow of genuine conversion slow to a trickle or even dry up. Paradoxically, busyness increases as real missional impact decreases. We shift from the missional idea of “me for the community and the community for the world” to the consumptive “the community for me”—and this can be catastrophic.

Recovery only comes by recalibrating the community along fundamentally missional lines—often at the cost of pain and numerical loss. But through this, we can experience true _communitas_ again, rather than the highly individualistic forms of community typical in free-market cultures: voluntary associations of autonomous individuals.

## Liminality and Communitas: Naming the Mystery

In trying to understand what was happening in our own church—and to answer how apostolic movements grow so remarkably against all odds—I have found Victor Turner’s concepts of _liminality_ and _communitas_ to be essential.

Robert Inchausti relates that Nikolai Berdyaev saw middle-classness at its most debased level as “a state of the soul characterized by a degrading clutching after security and a small-mindedness incapable of imagining a world much larger than one’s own.”

> _“For [Berdyaev], the bourgeois didn’t worship money per se, but they were addicted to personal success, security, and happiness. For these things, they willingly compromised their honor, ignored injustice, and betrayed truth, replacing these high values with trite moralisms and facile bromides.... The bourgeois did not repudiate religion but reinterpreted its value in terms of utility. The love of the poor moved to the periphery of the faith and was embraced only insofar as it didn’t clash with one’s own personal economic interests.”_  
> —Inchausti, _Subversive Orthodoxy_, 42–43

Turner, an anthropologist, studied rites of passage among African people groups and coined _liminality_ to describe the transition process with fundamental changes in state or social position. Liminal situations are often extreme; participants are cast out of normal society, subjected to tests, and must find new inner and outer resources. For example, in some African tribes, boys are initiated into manhood through isolation and ordeal, moving from the security of the female quarters into the wild: a period of pure liminality.

Through shared ordeal, initiates move from disorientation and individualism to deep camaraderie and community—a bond Turner called _communitas_. This happens when individuals, driven by a common experience of trial, come to belong to one another and rely on one another to survive. Communitas is what creates and renews tribal culture: if communitas is the result, liminality is the catalyst that produces it.

### Liminality in Discipleship and Church Life

Contrary to what we might think, danger can be good for us.

> _“Danger does highlight the paradoxical nature of good and evil—at least as to how we experience it. It highlights goodness and gives it a wholesome aspect that evil in itself denies.”_  
> —Corbin Carnell, _Bright Shadow of Reality_, 109

Liminality is where we are out of our comfort zones—at risk, challenged, or deliberately on an adventure. This is critical for the formation of communitas, and for learning, discipleship, healthy psychology, character development, and innovation. Refusing essential risk leads to fearful neurosis and the decline of any living organism, individual, or community.

#### Traditional Rites as an Example

- **Context of Security:** Young boys raised in the women's quarters until age thirteen.
- **Initiation:** At the appropriate time, they are taken by tribal men into the bush. There they undergo ordeal—physical, psychological, social.
- **Reintegration:** After shared hardship, they are welcomed back as men. Communitas is forged.

| Security      | Ordeal          | Reintegration   |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Safety/nurture| Disorientation  | Comradery/Status |

## Liminality and Communitas in Mission and Innovation

Christian community is called not to “huddle and cuddle” but to form around a common mission — a dangerous journey to unknown places. This requires shaking off collective securities and plunging into action and the world—where we encounter God and one another in new ways. Communitas is always linked to the experience of liminality: it involves movement, adventure, and a shared vision for a better world. It creates unique togetherness that emerges only from the attempt to bring change.

### The Normativity of Liminality-Communitas

Some missiologists view liminality and communitas as temporary phases the church passes through, but I contend they are the _normative_ condition of the pilgrim people of God. For example, the early Christian movements and the Chinese underground church experienced liminality through persecution and marginality, yet these were the very conditions in which they thrived. Exemplary Jesus movements are expressions of communitas—not mere community. The loss of this leads to a diminished phenomenon of Apostolic Genius.

---

### Liminality and Communitas in Biblical Narrative

When we survey Scripture, the most fertile theological insights emerge during periods of extremity—times of profound liminality. Consider:

- **Patriarchs (e.g., Abraham):** Called to leave everything familiar for a risky journey.
- **Exodus:** Shaped Israel permanently; context of transformative revelation.
- **Exile in Babylon:** Changed Israel’s relationship with God dramatically.
- **Prophets:** Spoke into situations of extremity, reminding people of their dangerous calling.
- **Jesus and Paul:** Lived and taught in liminal contexts—no permanent home, hostile environments, exposure to danger.
- **The Book of Acts:** Reads like an adventure story, full of risk, challenge, and shared ordeal.

These are not mere descriptive stories; they are prescriptive for the church because liminality and communitas are normative for God's pilgrim people.

---

## Liminality and Communitas in Everyday Life

Having seen liminality-communitas for what it is, it is easy to spot it in countless areas of life:

- **Social Upheaval/Disaster Response:** Tragedies like a tsunami awaken communitas as people rally to help.
- **Sports Teams:** Individualistic people form a team, finding camaraderie through common challenge.
- **Deadlines at Work:** Teams bond as they work toward a goal they could not achieve alone.
- **Adventure Camps & Short-term Missions:** Participants leave safety and experience transformation together.
- **Burning Man Festival:** Participants submit themselves to deliberate liminality (cultural and geographic), experiencing mystical joy and communitas through a “gift economy.”

> “Prophets and artists tend to be liminal and marginal people, ‘edgemen’… In their productions we may catch glimpses of that unused evolutionary potential in mankind...”  
> —Victor Turner, _Ritual Process_

---

### Liminality-Communitas in Story and Myth

The mythic arc of liminality and communitas shapes much of our storytelling:

- **Movies:** The common arc—normalcy, disruption, disorientation, coming together to overcome a problem, and return to a “new normal”—is a rite of passage narrative featuring liminality and communitas.
    - Examples: Jason Bourne series, _Saving Private Ryan_, _Master and Commander_, _The Matrix_, and so on.
- **The Lord of the Rings:** The “Fellowship of the Ring” moves from a mere group to a true communitas through shared peril, mission, and hardship. They become something greater than they could have imagined, forming inseparable bonds along the way.

> “The elf and the dwarf become inseparable friends, and the hobbits become something they never could have been if they had remained in the safety of the shire.”

Such stories have real power because they awaken our need for adventure, journey, and comradeship.

### The Need for Liminality: Danger and Crisis as Catalysts

> _“I do not think the forest would be so bright, nor the water so warm, nor love so sweet, if there were no danger in the lakes.”_  
> —C. S. Lewis

Danger, while exposing us to risk, also creates opportunities for personal and corporate growth. Without risk and adventure, communities—like organisms—decay.

David Bosch put it well:

> _“One ought to say that the Church is always in a state of crisis and that its greatest shortcoming is that it is only occasionally aware of it. … To encounter crisis is to encounter the possibility of truly being the Church.”_  
> —Bosch, _Transforming Mission_

## Antifragility, Adaptation, and Missional Leadership

Nassim Taleb’s concept of _antifragility_—systems that strengthen from stress and disorder—is apt for the church. Resilience means surviving threats; antifragility means improving because of them. The church, especially in the West, is generally nonadaptive, risk-averse, and obsessed with safety. But the historical record—and living systems theory—shows that engaging with external risk is essential for healthy growth.

### Communitas through Collaborative Projects

- **Urban Murals:** Community artwork that requires collaboration, dialogue, and joint effort, deepening relationships among participants.
- **Communal Gardens, Political Activism, Habitat for Humanity:** Shared enterprise breeds communitas, stimulating learning, conversation, and camaraderie.

---

### Living Systems Theory and Liminality

Living systems tend toward equilibrium—closer to death—if they don’t respond to their environments.

- **Law of Requisite Variety:** A living system’s survival depends on internal adaptability equal to or exceeding external environmental diversity.
- **Equilibrium = Risk:** When a system is unresponsive, it decays. Fish in a controlled aquarium, for example, are less robust than their wild counterparts because the artificial environment breeds fragility.

#### Church as Fish Tank

Many churches have become such artificial environments—safe, sterile, closed off, and preoccupied with self-maintenance. Without engagement with the wider world, congregations become insular and unable to adapt; the “missional” component is absent, and the community withers.

---

## Thriving at the Edge of Chaos

> _“Equilibrium is a precursor to death. When a living system is in a state of equilibrium, it is less responsive to changes occurring around it. This places it at maximum risk.”_  
> —Pascale, Millemann, and Gioja, _Surfing the Edge of Chaos_

Living systems flourish when moved to the edge of chaos—when compelled to respond creatively to outside threats or opportunities. The missional context surrounding the modern church does not allow for stability or the luxury of passivity; it instead demands risk-taking, experimentation, and innovation.

Missional leadership is therefore about:

- Holding a clear vision of the future
- Building and nurturing learning cultures and networks of communication
- Creating climates of trust and mutual support
- Encouraging questioning and innovation
- Allowing mistakes and recognizing viable novelty when it emerges

As Roxburgh and Romanuk note, church leadership must “cultivate environments wherein the Spirit of God might call forth and unleash the missional imagination of the people of God.”

## The Power of Vision: Managing from the Future

> _“Most people think of the future as the ends and the present as the means, whereas in fact, the present is the ends and the future the means.”_  
> —Fritz Roethlisberger

A bold, compelling vision—much like Kennedy’s moonshot or Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream—pulls people out of their comfort zones into liminality and catalyzes communitas.

- **Billy Payne and the Atlanta Olympics:** Pursued a seemingly unattainable goal, rallied supporters, overcame obstacles, and succeeded by acting _as if_ the future vision were already true.

Similarly, in mission, we are called to operate “from the future”—to act as if God’s kingdom is already present, shaping our present reality and behavior.

---

## Mission as the Organizing Principle

- **Gordon Cosby’s observation:** Groups centered on nonmissional purposes (prayer, worship, study, etc.) rarely become missional; only groups with an outward focus and intent become so.
- Most church activities serve insiders and do not address missional engagement. A church that aims at ministry seldom achieves mission; but a church that aims at mission must necessarily engage in ministry as well.

### Community vs. Communitas

|     | Community                   | Communitas                        |
|-----|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Purpose | Exists for insiders’ benefit, energy directed inward (“The Community for Me”) | Exists for a vision beyond itself, energy directed outward (“Me for the Community and the Community for the World”) |

Mission, not ministry, must be the organizing principle. Without it, the community shrivels and dies—first spiritually, then physically.

---

## Beyond the Either-Or Church

Platonic dualism, dividing life into “sacred” and “secular,” led to an artificial church environment—a “fishbowl”—disconnected from the fullness of life under God. The average churchgoer experiences life as a series of disconnected realms: the dangerous secular world, the neutral social space of church fellowship, and occasional spiritual highs in worship—failing to integrate all aspects of life under God's sovereignty.

---

## Conclusion

To rediscover missional movement and flame the fires of Apostolic Genius, the church must:

- Embrace liminality and communitas as normative, not exceptional
- Intentionally pursue risk, adventure, and shared experience
- Abandon obsession with safety, security, and comfort
- Move from safe middle-class consumer religion to dynamic participation in God’s mission

In doing so, we do not merely survive adversity—we grow, adapt, and thrive for the sake of the world and the advance of the Kingdom.
