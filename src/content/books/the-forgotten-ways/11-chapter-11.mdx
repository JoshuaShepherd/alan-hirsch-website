---# Organic Systems, Movement Ethos, and the Structure of Missional Movements

> “It is one of the tragic fates of human existence that, over time, the very structures we create to support and enliven a cause take on a life of their own and in some way become the cause.”  

## The Law of Unintended Consequences in Religious Institutions

Tim Catchim, Dave Ferguson, and I discuss these dynamics in depth in *On the Verge* (see chapters 7–8). A key historical example is the synod intended to determine the correct date for Easter and address the monks' hairstyle (tonsure). The Roman party viewed the Celtic method, which differed by only a few days, and its tonsure as tantamount to heresy. On the basis of such trivial issues, the Roman organic systems evolved into the Inquisition (commencing in 1231), which tortured and burned tens of thousands in the name of religious compliance and doctrinal control.

It seems the structures we create to support a cause often become rigid over time. Gradually, the once-vibrant, innovative movements morph into conservative, controlling institutions. Most denominations likely began as innovative movements, yet now adhere to established ideas and models from different contexts, often insisting that faithfulness can only be achieved by maintaining traditional practices.

The tragedy is that, when power becomes entrenched within religious institutions, a dangerous culture of restraint emerges. Organizations enshrining this culture are particularly resistant to change. As Harvard’s David K. Hurst observes, institutionalization involves a shift from being "hunters" (dynamic, adaptable) to "herders" (structured, unyielding).

### Marks of the Shift from Hunter to Herder (Hurst)

- **Mission** becomes **strategy**
- **Roles** become **tasks**
- **Teams** become **structure**
- **Networks** become **organization**
- **Recognition** becomes **compensation**

An example of this institutional drift: churches progressively outsourced education to seminaries. Originally grassroots training centers, seminaries accrued authority and accreditation, becoming powerful institutions that tamed remarkable missionary movements (see: Cahill, *How the Irish Saved Civilization*; Hurst, *Crisis and Renewal*).

It eventually became necessary to secure institutional approval—an *imprimatur*—to do what Jesus entrusted to every believer. In mainline denominations today, ordination or licensing (often requiring multiple degrees) stands as a substantial barrier to grassroots ministry.

### The New Testament and Apostolic Movements

How do these structures align with the New Testament or exemplary apostolic movements? The reality is that falling in love with one's system leads to an inability to adapt or recognize systemic issues. Prophetic questions and apostolic frameworks are required for meaningful change, but institutions have long since marginalized these irritants. Institutions are, in effect, perfectly designed to yield their current results.

## Decentralizing Power and Function

Despite these challenges, systems can be redesigned to facilitate movemental outcomes. Networked structures diffuse power and responsibility, guarding against institutionalism's encroachment.

> "Power not only corrupts; it also attracts the corruptible."

Genuine movements of Jesus are essentially networks, not centralized institutions. Curtis Sergeant, an expert on the Chinese underground church, notes that as seminaries become degree providers, their accountability shifts from local churches' needs to governmental standards. Outsourcing education to seminaries leads to local churches becoming dependent on external institutions, diminishing their capacity to disciple and teach. This suppression of discipleship and centralization stifles apostolic genius at the grassroots level.

**Key Principle:**  
External human control over new converts is inversely proportional to potential growth—both in maturity and size. Micromanagement breeds dependence and hinders multiplication (cf. Garrison, *Church Planting Movements*).

### Case Study: The Chinese Underground Church

In 2005, Michael Frost met with three leaders of the Chinese underground church smuggled out of China. They asked for prayer concerning:

1. Government prohibitions on gatherings larger than twenty—any excess triggered a split and a new church.
2. The inability to own church buildings, forcing meetings in homes, cafes, and clubs.
3. The prohibition against centralized leader training—training had to happen in-house.

Frost, a seminary vice president, realized he could not, in good conscience, pray for these restrictions to be lifted. Paradoxically, the church’s governmental oppression inadvertently preserved its movement dynamics.

Philip Yancey offers another poignant reflection from China:  
> “‘We felt so sorry for the church we left behind,’ [the expelled missionary] said. ‘They had no one to teach them, no printing presses, no seminaries, no one to run their clinics and orphanages. No resources, really, except the Holy Spirit.’” Yancey concludes, “It appears the Holy Spirit is doing just fine.”

## Movement Ethos Versus Institutionalism

A movement ethos is an antidote to the dangers of institutionalism. Movements are marked by different composition and feel than denominational institutions; the differences are paradigmatic.

**H. R. Niebuhr:**  
> “The one is conservative, the other progressive; the one is more or less passive, yielding to influences from the outside, the other is active in influencing rather than being influenced; the one looks to the past, the other to the future. In addition, the one is anxious, the other is prepared to take risks; the one guards boundaries, the other crosses them.”

### Case Study: Christian Associates International (CAI)

CAI (now Communitas International) set an ambitious goal in 1999: to identify and develop 500 missionaries to establish one or more missional churches in 50 major European cities by 2010—a goal it nearly achieved. By adopting a missional movement ethos and the latent potentials of Apostolic Genius, CAI became a church-planting movement defined by instinctive, habitual, incarnational mission.

### Case Study: DOVE Christian Fellowship International (DCFI)

DCFI traces its roots to a 1970s Bible study connected to the Jesus movement. Frustrated with mainstream church structures, it adopted an underground church model, meeting in cells across the city. By 1992, it had about 2,500 believers in 125 groups, and expanded internationally. Recognizing growth barriers, DCFI shifted further toward a networked, “apostolic movement” structure—emphasizing relationships, influence, and empowerment at the grassroots level.

## Naming the Whirlwind: The Key Characteristics of Movements

> “Most groups that have impact... almost always begin with a form sociologists call a movement.”

### Working Definition of a Movement

A movement is:

> *A group of people organized for, ideologically motivated by, and committed to a purpose which implements personal or social change; who are actively engaged in the recruitment of others; and whose influence is spreading in opposition to the established order within which it originated.*

This definition fits both social and religious movements, including the early church in Acts, as well as contemporary apostolic movements in China, South America, and Africa.

### Life Cycle of Movements

As outlined by management studies (Hoover, Rumkorff, Sherwood, Rodger):

- **Uptake phase:** Characterized by belief, mission, vision, risk.
- **Decline:** Characterized by doubt, administration, programming, and institutionalization replacing vision and mission.

Missional movements embody values related to conviction, responsibility, and dynamism. Decline sets in as the structure shifts focus toward preserving the status quo.

## Characteristics of Movements

**Howard Snyder (Wesleyan perspective):**

- A thirst for renewal: Discontent with current conditions drives innovation.
- New stress on the work of the Spirit: Emphasized as real, present experience.
- Institutional–charismatic tension: Renewal brings tension within existing structures.
- Countercultural community: Radical commitment fosters tension with the world.
- Nontraditional leadership: Often led by those without formal status; spiritual authority matters most. Marginalized groups, especially women, are more active.
- Ministry to the poor: Movements work at the grassroots and the margins.
- Energy and dynamism: Ability to excite and gather others.

**Gerlach & Hine (sociological perspective):**

- Segmented, cellular organization: Small faith communities/linkages.
- Face-to-face recruitment: Done via existing significant relationships.
- Commitment through conversion: A radical reorientation separates the convert from the established order.
- Articulated ideology: Clear, shared values and goals unite the movement.
- Real or perceived opposition: Almost all movements face societal or institutional resistance.

Both perspectives reinforce the observation that new missional movements arise on the edges of society, and are non-elitist and dynamic.

## Apostolic Movements and Network Structures

Apostolic movements are organized around network structures—not central buildings or institutions. Early Christians—like the Chinese church under oppression—did not have formal buildings; rather, community and mission were rooted in households (oikos) and relational networks (see Minear, *Images of the Church*).

**Albert-László Barabási** describes network thinking as fundamental to all human organization. Networks take three basic forms:

1. **Chain/Line Network:** Connections form a sequence; communication travels node-to-node.
2. **Hub, Star, or Wheel Network:** Agents are connected through a central node (not necessarily hierarchical).
3. **All-Channel or Full-Matrix Network:** Every node is connected to every other; collaborative and non-centralized.

The all-channel network—flat, decentralized, and composed of small units—is difficult to maintain but maximizes potential for collaborative undertaking, and is increasingly empowered by the information revolution.

**Wheatley & Frieze** underscore that systemic change comes not from individuals but from networks of relationships sharing a common vision. As networks become communities of practice, entirely new systems emerge.

> “As networks grow and transform... suddenly and surprisingly a new system emerges at a greater level of scale. This system of influence possesses qualities and capacities that were unknown in the individuals. Emergence is how Life creates radical change and takes things to scale.”

**Dee Hock** (founder of Visa):  
> “Purpose and principle, clearly understood and articulated, and commonly shared, are the genetic code of any healthy organization. To the degree that you hold purpose and principles in common among you, you can dispense with command and control.”

**Keys to Developing Networked Organizations (Hock):**

- Adaptability and resilience, unified by shared purpose and principles.
- Equity, autonomy, and opportunity distributed to the lowest level.
- Governance by dialogue and coordination among equals, not command chains.

## Hubs, Nodes, and Networked Influence

Networks are composed of "nodes" (individuals, groups, organizations) and "hubs" (key points of connection). Over time, certain nodes become hubs due to utility, history, or circumstance (e.g., Antioch, Jerusalem, Paul in the early church).

Communication must be dense and responsive—networks thrive when information flows promptly and broadly, both internally and externally.

---

## Networks in Practice: Contemporary Movements

Modern church-multiplication movements—like Stadia (USA/global), Neil Cole's CMA and Greenhouse, the Soma Family of Churches, and Paul Yonggi Cho's Korean movements—have all adopted decentralized network models. Growth is natural, exponential, and often under the radar of traditional church-growth analysis.

---

## Learning from Secular Networks: Al Qaeda Example

Surprisingly, the decentralized, all-channel structure of Al Qaeda mirrors not only the early church but also Chinese underground networks. Each cell contains the full DNA of the movement, replicating effortlessly under the right conditions while remaining essentially indestructible.

> “Each Jesus community has the full and complete quotient of mDNA embedded in it, and, if true to its own calling and given the right conditions, can become the beginning of a whole new apostolic movement.”

---

## Patterns of Growth: Hyperbolic Multiplication

The film *Pay It Forward* illustrates the principle beautifully: each person commits to affecting two others, who in turn do the same, creating a wave of transformation. If churches and disciples adopted this method in evangelism, discipleship, and church planting, the resulting growth would be more like the explosive, hyperbolic curve seen in healthy movements.

**Illustrations:**

- The early church grew from 25,000 to 20 million in 200 years.
- The Chinese church grew from 2 million to 120 million in forty years.

Even mathematically (the “rice on the chessboard” fable), small initial acts, when multiplied exponentially, yield staggering effects.

## Ideaviruses, Memes, and Contagious Movements

Walter Henrichsen observes:

> “The reason the church... finds it so hard to stay on top of the great commission is that the population... is multiplying while the church is merely adding. Addition can never keep pace with multiplication.”

Ideas—and the gospel itself—can spread virally, much like memes in cybernetic theory, encoding beliefs in transmissible form. *Apostolic Genius* acts as a memeplex: when people encounter it, they often "remember" something that seems already true, latent within themselves and the gospel.

**Seth Godin** (on ideaviruses):

> “An ideavirus is a big idea that runs amok across the target audience. It’s a fashionable idea that captures the thinking and imagination of a section of the population, teaching and influencing and changing everyone it touches.”

The capacity for exponential, transformative spread depends on “sneezers”—people who actively and contagiously pass on the idea within their networks.

## Conclusion: Recapturing Apostolic Genius

To recover the vitality of the early church, organizations must decentralize, foster networked leadership, and cultivate movement ethos. The seeds of movement are dormant within the church; by shedding institutional restraint and aligning with missional DNA (mDNA), we can catalyze fresh apostolic movements for every context.

> “If you are in doubt, consider this: Why was the underground Chinese church only truly activated when all the familiar institutions of church were forcibly removed?... The seed of the movement was dormant in the womb of the established church but was brought to life only when the familiar institutional forms were removed (John 12:24).”
