## Christendom: The Familiar Church and Its Legacy

When Christendom emerged, everything changed—absolutely everything. Look down the middle column in the table (Christendom), and you will easily recognize many elements that define what we normally understand as “church.” Is it not true that few can conceive of church without thinking of a special type of building with its distinct architecture? We even call the buildings “churches,” and we “go to church.”

Most church leaders obtain a license to minister from a centralized institution called a denomination. Most of those ordained within the system exhibit the pastor-teacher gift, accompanied by an accredited degree and ordination process. The other three ministry types found in Ephesians 4 (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist—APE) are largely absent. This is largely because, in a culture where everyone is assumed to be Christian, the church’s role narrows to care and teaching rather than broader apostolic or evangelistic engagement.

Within most denominations, only ordained ministers are authorized to administer the sacraments. Communion, once a full meal, is now distilled into symbolic elements administered within the church and by its official ministers. In high-church settings, grace itself is perceived as a substance, given through sacraments and only by priests. Thus, grace becomes a “possession” of the institutional church, inaccessible outside its direct influence.

## Organization, Structure, and the Centrality of the Church

Structurally, the organizational frameworks of Christendom differ radically from the early church. Compare the United Nations—a centralized institution with protocols—to Al Qaeda—a network with a simple structure and focused cause. Similarly, the Christendom-era church considered itself central to society, functioning primarily in an attractional mode: people come to church to hear the gospel, be taught, and partake of the sacraments.

> **Note**: This is not to suggest that God has not used, or does not use, this mode of church. Nor are the people within its structures lacking in sincerity or faith; many have found God within this mode. Yet, due to radically changed conditions, this configuration of church has become outmoded. It will not meet the challenges of the twenty-first century—statistics and trends bear this out in every Western context. Rearranging aspects of the same model will not suffice; we must go to the roots of the paradigm.

Christendom cannot simply be abandoned, for within it are God’s people. However, it requires a fundamental change—a conversion, so to speak—if it is to become the missional movement Jesus intended. This change is possible, but not without a major realignment of thinking and resources. In missional settings, the attractional approach often becomes "extractional," severing the convert’s organic ties to their host culture and creating a culturally distant Christian cloister.

Christendom is deeply entrenched in both practice and imagination, and change will not occur without considerable will and the overcoming of vested interests.

## The Need for a Paradigm Shift

> "We are surrounded by the relics of the Christendom Paradigm, a paradigm that has largely ceased to work. [These] relics hold us hostage to the past and make it difficult to create a new paradigm that can be as compelling for the next age as the Christendom Paradigm has been for the past age."  
> — Loren Mead, *Once and Future Church*

It is high time to "dethrone Constantine"; for many, he still rules in our ecclesial imaginations. To experience renewal, we must reconnect with our deepest roots. The liberating realization is that Christendom was not the original mode of the church—and it need not be the last. The church now faces the challenge of discovering mission in a new paradigm while struggling to break free from the Christendom mindset.

## (Re)Discovering a New Story: The Missional Movement

> “It’s Church, Jim, but Not as We Know It.”

It is time to (re)discover a new story of the church and its mission. Enter what is broadly called the missional movement.

Recent years have seen sustainable, innovative forms of church flourish:
- **Fresh Expressions (FX):** Now a leading source of new converts in the UK, Europe, Australia, Canada, and the US.
- **Forge Mission Training Network:** With training hubs across the world, thousands of grassroots missionaries in the West are being equipped.
- **V3 (Virginia Baptists):** An incarnational church movement planting communities across America.
- **Ecclesia Network:** Generating new, contextualized churches in the US.
- **Soma:** Missional communities now worldwide.
- **New Song and Xealots:** Led by Dave Gibbon, growing in impact.

A notable point: much of this leadership is grassroots, creative, and pioneering—often not formally ordained. There is a rediscovery of Christology and the person of Jesus as the center, rather than mere dogma.

Similar momentum can be found in:
- **Soma Family of Churches** (Jeff & Jayne Vanderstelt, Caesar Kalinowski, Abe Meysenburg)
- **Underground Network** (Brian Sanders)
- **3DM** (Mike Breen)
- **Trinity Grace** (Jon Tyson)

Even large, established churches are adopting missional thinking, such as those involved in **Future Travelers** and the **NewThing Network** (Dave and Jon Ferguson). **Redeemer Presbyterian** (Tim Keller) has wielded global influence through their **City to City** network.

Church-planting movements are vibrant:
- **NewThing Network:** A church starts every ten days in America; it has doubled annually since 2005.
- **C2C (Canada):** Overseeing new community planting nationwide.
- **Acts 29, Hope Chapel, Church Multiplication Network:** Planting and nurturing thousands of communities.

Missional conferences and educational programs now abound:
- **Missio Alliance, Verge, Sentralized, Exponential:** Forums integrating missional approaches.
- Seminaries worldwide now offer specialized missional degrees (US: Asbury, Wheaton, etc.; UK: ForMission; Canada: Tyndale; Australia: Morling; South Africa: Pretoria, Stellenbosch).

## The Organic/House Church Phenomenon

The organic church, house church, or simple church movement continues to grow, notably through the work of Neil Cole and Church Multiplication Associates. With an estimated 10,000+ initial churches and over 50,000 trained leaders worldwide, the movement demonstrates considerable grassroots vitality.

Studies by the Barna Group reveal that millions are exploring spiritual community outside traditional structures; house church attendance has risen from 1% to 9% weekly, with approximately 70 million adults having experimented with house churches.

While not all house churches align with the broader missional church movement, collectively they represent an active search for simpler, more life-embedded forms of church.

> "Somewhere in the genesis and genius of these diverse groups is hidden the future of Western Christianity. To dismiss them is to throw away the seeds of our survival."
> — Gerard Kelly, *RetroFuture*

Yet, most Christians remain connected to outmoded forms, unable to imagine church outside the Christendom model—a problem first and foremost of imagination.

## The Rise of “Churchless” Christians and Apostolic Movements

According to the *World Christian Encyclopedia*, there are 111 million Christians without a local church. Many are actively working out their faith, having left institutional structures, particularly in the 20–35 age group.

Even more potent is the rise of “independents” or “apostolics”—over 20,000 movements and networks with a claimed 394 million members globally, rising toward 581 million by 2025 (more than all Protestant denominations combined).

These movements:
- Reject centralized authority
- Gather in varied community sizes
- Focus life on Jesus
- Practice a missionary lifestyle

Despite global scope, even a fraction of these numbers in the West represents a significant shift.

Barna’s research (2005) finds that those no longer attending church have almost doubled since 1991—despite many still professing active faith in Christ.

## Toward a Missionary Identity

This analysis has led to the embrace of a missionary identity and practice. Design thinking in organizational leadership, particularly as articulated by Roger Martin, now shapes the strategy of the missional movement:

### The Design Thinking Process

1. **Start with Mystery:** Explore a big, unsolved question (e.g., how did the early church grow so rapidly?).
2. **Develop a Heuristic:** Formulate a working theory or rule of thumb (e.g., the Apostolic Genius model with its six interlocking mDNA elements).
3. **Design and Refine Algorithms:** Operationalize the heuristic so it can be shared and acted upon within the organization.
4. **Code into the Organization:** Embed these algorithms so deeply that they become the organization’s habits.

A critical insight: without addressing the root paradigm—the “story” of church—we risk superficial change. New algorithms without a new paradigm simply become programs added to an old system.

## Paradigm Shift: Dethroning Constantine and Rediscovering Movement

The renewal process starts with seeing the Christendom paradigm’s limitations. The journey involves:

1. **Recognizing the Problem:** Understand that inherited forms cannot guide us into the future.
2. **Dethroning Constantine:** Begin to reimagine the church as a missional movement, not just an institution.
3. **Tapping Latent Potential:** Realize that the seeds of future movements are already present in the church’s DNA.
4. **Birthing Apostolic Movement:** Movements generate and sustain innovation, embracing multiple models rather than maintaining a monopoly on form.

> "What got us here is not going to get us there. The situation dictates, among other things, a fundamental theological recalibration in our self-understanding as God’s people, a renewed sense of our unique purpose in his world, and nothing short of a paradigm shift in how we relate to whatever context we happen to find ourselves in."

## Reclaiming Movement: A Journey to Apostolic Genius

> "To my mind, there must be at the bottom of it all, not an utterly simple equation, but an utterly simple IDEA. And to me that idea, when we finally discover it, will be so compelling, and so inevitable, so beautiful, we will all say to each other, 'How could it have ever been otherwise?'"
> — John Wheeler, former chair, Department of Physics, University of Texas at Austin

> "The best way to escape the comfortable familiarity of an inherited picture of reality is to try to return to something more original, more immediate: to retreat from one’s habitual interpretations of one’s experiences of the world, and back to those experiences themselves, as unencumbered as possible by preconceptions and prejudices."
> — David Bentley Hart

> "If we go down into ourselves, we find that we possess exactly what we desire."
> — Simone Weil

In this next section, we move to the heart of the matter: recovering the “strangely new yet ancient way” that has made God's people the most transformative force in history. Application will vary:

- **Established churches:** Must develop healthy change processes to reorient toward apostolic forms.
- **Church planters/missionaries:** Should embed movement DNA (mDNA) in the team and structure from inception.
- **Missional dreamers:** May find shape and direction for their emerging visions.

The claim: empowered by the Spirit, when all six elements of mDNA are mutually present, a fundamentally different church—a genuine apostolic movement—is born.

## The Six Elements of mDNA

**Encyclopaedia Britannica** defines DNA as "organic chemical of complex molecular structure that is found in all organic, living cells...DNA codes genetic information for the transmission of inherited traits."

For missional church:
- **mDNA** refers to “movement DNA,” serving as the genetic code for reproducing and sustaining genuine missional movements.
- Each cell (church) holds the full coding required for movement: the macrocosm in the microcosm, the tree in the seed.
- The possibility of movement lies at the root of the church's existence.

All six elements of mDNA are identifiable in every significant mission movement in history, from the New Testament church, to the Celtic and Moravian movements, to Chinese house churches.

### Why mDNA Matters

- DNA is present in every living cell.
- It codes for transmission and reproduction beyond the initiator.
- It is self-replicating; healthy reproduction depends on DNA integrity.
- Mutations to the code ripple through the organism.

The same is true for churches: mDNA guarantees movement potential but is often dormant or suppressed in favor of more manageable forms.

> The seed of the future is in the womb of the present.

## Metaphors for mDNA

- **Meta-idea:** Foundational ideas that produce, organize, and transmit all others.
- **Archetype or Instinct:** Built-in guiding patterns determining behavior across all movements.
- **Meme:** Reproducible, contagious ideas or behaviors spreading through a culture or movement.
- **Memeplex:** A cluster of related memes, forming a powerful movement ecosystem.

## Apostolic Genius: The Movement System

The term “Apostolic Genius” refers to the animating spirit of dynamic church movements. Difficult though it may be to define, it characterizes the exponential growth and transformation witnessed in both the early church and modern movements like the underground church in China.

Apostolic Genius is an **emergent organization**. As Margaret Wheatley notes:

> "When separate, local efforts connect...as networks, then strengthen as communities...a new system emerges at a greater scale...with qualities and capacities that were unknown in individuals."

**Apostolic Genius** arises from the dynamic interaction of all six mDNA elements. Each, while distinct, must function synergistically. Improving any one area (e.g., discipleship) is beneficial, but full movemental power is unlocked only when all connect in a systemic way.

## The Role of the Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit is not merely one element among the six but the **ground and context** in which apostolic movements are birthed, sustained, and empowered. All innovation, connectedness, discipleship, and mission depend on the Spirit’s work.

## Contemporary Example: Church Multiplication Associates (CMA)

CMA, founded by Neil Cole, exemplifies these concepts in action. Cole's vision was not to start a single church, but to spark a multiplication movement—abandoning anything that hindered indigenous multiplication of disciples, leaders, churches, and movements.

- **Life Transformation Groups** serve as the main structure.
- Mission is expressed in all imaginable contexts, from homes to cafés.
- Leadership is decentralized; groups are networked relationally, not hierarchically.

Many of the classic elements—lordship of Jesus, discipleship, APEST ministry, risk-taking, incarnational mission—are present. CMA is only one example; similar patterns can be seen globally.

## Missional and Missional Church: Clarifications

The term **missional**, as popularized by the Gospel and Our Culture Network (GOCN) and Lesslie Newbigin, originally emphasized a missionary stance toward Western culture. Over time, its meaning has blurred, sometimes reduced to marketing or church-growth terminology. Its value lies in capturing the radical thrust of Jesus movements rediscovered today. It is vital to retain and reinvest the word with its original depth.

> In the recovery and reactivation of this potential lying dormant in God’s people, we may find the spiritual, theological, and missional renewal so desperately needed in the Western church.
