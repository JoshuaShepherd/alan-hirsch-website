---# The Crisis of Consumerism and the Missional Church

> “What you win them with, you win them to.”

Churches in the West have increasingly devolved into worship clubs for trendy young people alienated from broader cultural expressions. Unintentionally, we have fallen prey to a consumerist co-option of the church, substituting entertainment for mission. Like most churches in the Christendom mode, we have relied too heavily on attraction, establishing churches with a consumerist model—and, in the end, paid the price. As the adage goes: what you win them with, you win them to. If marketing and entertainment are the lures, they become the foundation and the ongoing expectation of the church experience. Entertainment-driven churches must continually entertain, for that is the implicit social contract.

### The Attractional Model: Consumerism and Its Discontents

Sound harsh? Consider that church-growth proponents in the 1980s explicitly encouraged churches to adopt the shopping mall as metaphor and model. Well-intentioned though they were, they did not anticipate the ramifications: when the medium is consumerism, the message itself becomes consumerist. Unwittingly, these leaders transmitted a latent virus into the system: the self-indulgence of the privileged middle-class, built on ideals of comfort, convenience, safety, and security.

> “We shape our buildings, and then they shape us.” —Winston Churchill

#### The Traditional and Contemporary Models

- **Pulpit Ministry (Traditional Model):**  
  - About 5% of the church is active in ministry  
  - 95% remain passive “audience”

- **Platform Ministry (Church-Growth Model):**  
  - About 10% of the church is active in ministry  
  - 90% passive “audience”

In both models, most members are passive receivers of religious services—not participants in mission. Is this the faithful image of ecclesia as Jesus intended? Is church truly meant to be a “feeding trough” for capable, educated, middle-class people more focused on their careers than on following Christ?

#### Entertainment, Passivity, and the Audience Effect

Ministers unknowingly cater to this dynamic, rarely questioning the inherited system and its pressures. Following the consumerist agenda, the church becomes a service provider: a vendor of religious goods and services. This “service-provision” approach starkly contrasts with Jesus’ methods. He spoke in parables, prompting spiritual searching among hearers. He did not offer easy, three-point sermons with all the answers; he activated his listeners, asking them to fill in the blanks, to be responsible and to choose.

At SMRC, we attempted to counter this trend:  
- Shifted from monological sermons to dialogical discussions  
- Experimented with multisensory communication and alternative forms of worship  
- Created a lounge-like, art-filled atmosphere

Despite these innovations, only 20% of our community became active in ministry—leaving 80% passive and consumptive.

- **Highly Participatory, Alternative Worship:**  
  - About 20% active in ministry  
  - 80% passive “audience”  

Ironically, these efforts may have worsened things. Once accustomed to “spice and garlic,” people could not return to “meat and potatoes”—they became restless, unable to reconnect with more conventional expressions. This prompted a difficult question: does alternative worship breed deeper consumerism?

### Church Growth: The “Ministry Mix” and Its Limitations

If you want to grow a contemporary church based on church-growth principles, you must:

1. Expand and redesign your building
2. Offer excellent, relevant preaching
3. Develop inspiring “praise and worship” experiences with high-quality bands and leaders
4. Provide excellent parking and convenient access
5. Run outstanding children’s and youth programs
6. Establish cell groups or Christian education for pastoral care and community
7. Ensure that next week is “better” than the last to keep people returning

This “ministry mix” appeals directly to consumerism: the church with the best programs and appeal gets the “customers.” But what happens when another church with better programming moves into your area? Statistics reveal that most growth is from “switchers”—not from conversions.

> We cannot consume our way into discipleship. Consumption is detrimental to discipleship.

The church in the West is in decline, despite forty years of church-growth wisdom. Discipleship demands more than consumption.

## Rebuilding the Church: From Vendor to Movement

Recognizing these failings, our leadership resolved to rebuild the church around key biblical functions: Jesus, covenant community, worship, discipleship, and mission. The alternative was for the entire team to resign. Our new philosophical foundations focused on:

- **Moving from static church to dynamic movement:**  
  Transform the church from a geographically located institution to a city-wide movement.

- **Reversing passivity:**  
  Shift from 20:80 active-to-passive ratio to 80:20, promoting discipleship over consumer service.

- **Reproducibility:**  
  Create simple, embedded, transferable systems (internalized DNA).

- **Networked, organic multiplication:**  
  Build a decentralized, networked movement—avoiding centralized, bureaucratic models.

- **Mission as the organizing principle:**  
  Structure around mission, not ministry.

## The Shift: Beyond the Local

Our experience at SMRC led to further reflection at the denominational and translocal levels.

> “The right to search for the truth implies also a duty; one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be the truth.”
> —Albert Einstein

> “No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought.”
> —John Stuart Mill

> “Strictly speaking one ought to say that the Church is always in a state of crisis and that its greatest shortcoming is that it is only occasionally aware of it.... This ought to be the case because of the abiding tension between the church’s essential nature and its empirical condition. That there were so many centuries of crisis-free existence for the Church was therefore an abnormality.... And if the atmosphere of crisislessness still lingers on in many parts of the West, this is simply the result of a dangerous delusion. Let us also know that to encounter crisis is to encounter the possibility of truly being the Church.”
> —David Bosch, *Transforming Mission*

### A Denominational “View from Above”

Serving simultaneously at the local and denominational level provided a crucial perspective. It became increasingly clear: the Western church must either adopt a missionary posture relative to its cultural context—or face decline and possible extinction.

# Christendom and Systemic Inertia

> “If there is a known and successful cure for an illness, patients generally prefer the doctor to use the known cure rather than seek to design a better one. Yet there may be much better cures to be found.”  
> —Edward De Bono

Our precommitments to the Christendom mode keep us repeating past answers, resisting the risk of real progress. The reality is stark: after 2,000 years, Christianity is in numerical decline in every Western context. Even in the U.S.—long seen as Christendom’s stronghold—society is increasingly distancing itself from Christianity.

Yet few voices call for a radical rethink—not merely new programs, but a full critique of Christendom’s hidden operating assumptions. The church has so sacralized its inherited institutional forms that we confuse them with the kingdom itself. Most attempts at change do not go deep enough.

## Paradigms, Systems, and the Challenge of Lasting Change

A helpful analogy comes from computing:  
- **Programs:** interface with the end user  
- **Operating System:** mediates between program and machine  
- **Machine Language/Hardware:** basic code and physical system

Similarly, church change often focuses on adding programs or refining theology, neglecting the foundational “hardware” of the system: our Christendom assumptions. Unless the system itself changes, significant, lasting reform is impossible.

> “If a revolution destroys a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, those patterns will repeat themselves in the succeeding government. There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.”  
> —Robert Pirsig, *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*

Until we change our most basic paradigms and operating systems, nothing will change.

## The Power of Story: Paradigm Shifts and Narratives

Ivan Illich pointed out that the most radical way to change society is not violent revolution or gradual reform but to tell an alternative, compelling story—a new paradigm that unites past and present and offers a new vision for the future.

A **paradigm**, or “systems story,” is the set of core beliefs that maintains cultural unity and explains our actions.

### Typical Change Efforts

- **Most church change programs:** focus on structures, systems, and routines (the “petals” of culture)
- **What’s missing:** changing the core paradigm (the “center” of the flower), the systems story that shapes and constrains all else

Bill Easum puts it this way:

> “Following Jesus into the mission field is either impossible or extremely difficult for the vast majority of congregations in the Western world because of one thing: they have a systems story that will not allow them to take the first step out of the institution into the mission field.”

Restructuring organizations without changing their systems story is futile. Change must go to the roots.

# Critiquing and Reforming the Church

## Is It Biblical to Critique Institutions?

Are we justified in critiquing the inherited institutional forms from which we derive legitimacy? Scripture is full of such critiques:
- Yahweh’s warning about Israel’s demand for a king (*1 Samuel 8:20–22*)
- Jesus’ struggle with religious and political institutions
- Paul’s writings on “principalities and powers” (*Gal. 4:3–11; Col. 2:8, 20–23*)
- John’s apocalyptic indictment of “the system” in Revelation

Martin Buber warns:  
> “Centralization and codification, undertaken in the interests of religion, are a danger to the core of religion.”

C.S. Lewis similarly observes:  
> “There exists in every church something that sooner or later works against the very purpose for which it came into existence.”

Churches must constantly strive—by the grace of God—to keep focused on Christ’s original mission.

### Holy Rebellion & Reform

Rather than mere anti-institutionalism, the church needs a “holy rebellion/dissent.” Throughout history, apostles, prophets, and evangelists have led such movements—innovators and reformers who shed encumbering traditions that stifled the work of God. Historic dissent led to renewal (e.g., Wesley, Booth, the Pentecostal movement).

> “People in any organization are always attached to the obsolete—the things that should have worked but did not, the things that once were productive and no longer are.”  
> —Peter Drucker

# Cultural Distance and the Missionary Stance

Missiologist Ralph Winter’s *cultural distance* tool helps churches assess how far different groups are from meaningful engagement with the gospel.

## The Cultural Distance Scale

| Level  | Description                                        |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| m0     | Same language, interests, class (e.g., friends)    |
| m1     | Some awareness of Christianity; open, but distanced|
| m2     | Little interest or awareness of Christianity; wary |
| m3     | No idea of Christianity; marginalized groups       |
| m4     | Ethnic/religious groups with significant barriers  |

Most churches in the Christendom mode are only effective at m0–m1, rarely reaching beyond their own culture. However, effective mission must address m2–m4: groups with significant language, history, and cultural obstacles.

The church’s historic shift from marginal, persecuted movement to central, privileged institution (starting with Constantine’s Edict of Milan, AD 313) created Christendom: a partnership with state power, a uniform religious culture, and a centrally-controlled ecclesiastical system.

## The Decline of Christendom and the Rise of New Tribes

Enlightenment secularism and the emergence of the modern and postmodern periods led to the decline of Christendom’s hegemony. Today, Western society is marked by subcultures, tribalization, and a pluralism not seen since the early church. The average church’s attractional outreach is no longer effective beyond immediate cultural boundaries.

### The Alpha Course as Example

While the Alpha course has seen millions attend, its main impact remains within m0–m1 circles (“de-churched” people). As evidence, though millions have experienced Alpha, UK church growth is stagnant—the course does not reach beyond its immediate cultural base.

The pressing question: why insist that people “go to church” when the New Testament affirms they can “be” the church wherever they are?

# Three Modes of Church Across History

> “Semper reformanda—the church reformed, always reforming, according to the Word of God.”

Progress is both culturally desired and theologically required. Consider the following sociological grid of church patterns across eras:

| Factor                 | Apostolic (AD 32–313)    | Christendom (313–Current)     | Missional (Past 35 Years)             |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Locus of Gathering** | Households, underground  | Central buildings (“churches”)| Rejects centralized buildings; uses third places |
| **Leadership Ethos**   | Fivefold, decentralized  | Ordained clergy, professionalized | Pioneering, innovative, fivefold; ordination not essential |
| **Structure**          | Grassroots, network      | Hierarchical, centralized      | Decentralized, movemental, hybrid     |
| **Means of Grace**     | Community meals, laity  | Institutional sacraments, clergy | Democratizes sacraments; recovers meal/hospitality |
| **Position in Society**| Margins, illegitimate   | Central, privileged            | Fringes, marginalized, less legitimacy|
| **Missional Mode**     | Incarnational, transformational | Maintenance of order, defensive | Missional, incarnational, sending     |

*Adapted from Frost & Hirsch, *The Shaping of Things to Come*.

The early Jesus movement was grassroots, lacking institutions due to persecution and illegality. Without a headquarters, it spread by utilizing the rhythms and networks of everyday life. This dynamic persisted until the institutionalization of the church under Constantine, when mission was eclipsed by maintenance and consumption.

# Conclusion

The church cannot escape its mission by adopting consumerism and institutional comfort. Lasting change requires radical rethinking: a paradigm shift from consumption to participation, from institution to movement, from attractional to truly missional. We are invited—indeed, compelled—by both our context and our Lord to awaken from our Christendom slumber and reimagine what it means to “be” the church in the world today.
