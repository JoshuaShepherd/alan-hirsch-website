## Apostolic and Missional: Interchangeable Terms

In this new edition, readers will note that I use the terms “apostolic” and “missional” somewhat interchangeably. This is intentional: the Latin missio is a translation of the Greek apostellō, and both convey the English sense of “sent” or “purposed.” I have chosen this terminology not only because I prefer the language of the New Testament over that of later theological discourse, but also because I believe the historical conceptualization of “missional” often falls short of the biblical meaning of “apostle” and, by extension, “apostolic.”

Strangely, most theologians—and even missiologists—shy away from, and sometimes actively denounce, the use of direct biblical terminology in reference to “missional.” My suspicion is that this stems from an attenuated missiology. I believe something deeply problematic is at work here, and instead of submitting to this historical “ban,” we should raise the alarm. As Protestants, we would not tolerate similar censure regarding other biblical words, even those appearing less frequently in the New Testament, such as “believers,” “reconciliation,” or “holiness.” Why, then, do we accept this restriction? Something significant is lost when we prohibit the use of the very language the Bible uses to convey its truths.

This prohibition likely springs from deep within the Christendom system template, and it must be challenged if we are to move beyond routine Christendom ecclesiology and its missiological blind spots. In line with the authority of Scripture, I affirm that to recover biblical truths, we must come to terms with the very language God uses to reveal Himself. Why refrain from using biblical words to express and clarify biblical ideas? Why are we censured for using “apostle” and “apostolic”? Are we not striving to be a biblically defined people? And since when did Protestants prefer Latin to Greek?

## The Missional-Apostolic Paradigm

Applying the missional-apostolic paradigm to the role and purpose of the church, we can say:

> A missional church is a community of God’s people that defines itself by, and organizes its life around, its real purpose of being an agent of God’s mission to the world.

The church’s authentic organizing principle is the mission of God revealed in Jesus. When the church is engaged in mission, it is the true church: not only a product of God’s mission but also obligated and destined to extend it by all possible means. The mission of God flows through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus. To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes among His people.

If we can embed this inner meaning into our essential identity as God’s people, we will be well on our way to becoming an adaptive organization. This mission expresses itself in the myriad, redemptive ways that characterize the kingdom of God.

## Liminality and the Heart of It All

> The spontaneous expansion of the Church reduced to its elements is a very simple thing. It asks for no elaborate organization, no large finances, no great numbers of paid missionaries. In its beginning it may be the work of one man, and that a man neither learned in the things of this world, nor rich in the wealth of this world. What is necessary is faith. What is needed is the kind of faith which, uniting a man to Christ, sets him on fire.  
> —Roland Allen, *The Compulsion of the Spirit*

> It is not enough to say one’s prayers in private, maintain high personal morality, and then go to work to rebuild the tower of Babel. The substance and structure of the different aspects of our world need to be interrogated in the light of the unique achievement of Jesus.  
> —N. T. Wright

When Paul completes his exploration of the mystery of God’s involvement in our world, he exclaims in an ecstatic doxology, capturing the essence of reality:

> “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!  
> How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!  
> ‘Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?’  
> ‘Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?’  
> For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.”  
> —Romans 11:33–36

Here, Paul points to the core of the Hebraic understanding of God:  
> “For from him and through him and for him are all things.”  

This spiritual-theological core must be retrieved if we are to renew the church in our day.

## Rediscovering Apostolic Genius

All genuine Christian movements begin at their spiritual “ground zero”—a living encounter with the one true God “through whom all things came and through whom we live” (1 Cor. 8:6). If we neglect this center, we can neither understand nor reinvoke the power that shaped their lives and communities. Steven Addison, in his study of Christian movements, rightly concludes that they are sustained by “white hot faith,” rekindled by a rediscovery of the place and importance of Jesus.

At the heart of all great movements is a recovery of a simple Christology—essential conceptions of who Jesus is and what he does—accurately reflecting New Testament faith. These movements are, in a literal sense, Jesus movements.

### The Power of a Distilled Message

Persecution often forces persecuted movements to distill their message, stripping away unnecessary complexity to rediscover the core of their faith. The Chinese Jesus movement exemplifies this reality, growing from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years despite severe repression.

Key characteristics of such movements include:

- Reliance on trusted relational networks.
- Jettisoning unnecessary ecclesial practices.
- Condensing and purifying the core message.
- Making faith accessible and transferable—even to the illiterate.
- Enabling the rapid relational transmission of the gospel.

As a result, the gospel becomes a possession of the people, not just religious institutions. Given favorable relational and social conditions, easily transferable ideas create powerful movements with the capacity to change societies.

## The Essence of the Christian Message: Monotheism, Kingdom, and Covenant

The “gift” of persecution is that it compels the church to clarify its central message. Historical studies suggest that the answer lies in biblical monotheism—an existential encounter with the one God who both saves and claims us. The confession that God is one (“Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one...”) is at the heart of biblical faith and all authentic manifestations of Apostolic Genius.

### Context: From Polytheism to Monotheism

In the ancient Near East, life was saturated with the sacred; myriad deities ruled every sphere of existence. Polytheistic belief systems were complex, superstitious, and dangerous, as each deity had to be placated lest disaster strike.

Against this backdrop, the Shema proclaimed:

> “Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one. Love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments...are to be upon your hearts...”  
> —Deuteronomy 6:4–9 (emphasis added)

This declaration has direct and far-reaching implications:  
- Yahweh alone has the right to rule every aspect of life.
- No longer could there be separate gods for different domains (home, field, politics, work, etc.).
- The religious task was to honor the one God in all aspects of life.

Thus, the covenant between Israel and Yahweh began with God's absolute claim over all of Israel’s life, and a total ban on idols.

> “When God invades man’s consciousness, man’s reliance on ‘peace and security’ vanishes from every nook of his existence. ... When God chooses man, He invests him with full responsibility for total obedience to an absolute demand.”  
> —Paul Minear, *Eyes of Faith*

Salvation and lordship are therefore inseparable in biblical faith.

## Monotheism in the New Testament: Christocentric Monotheism

With the revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament, it becomes evident that each person of the Trinity plays a distinct role in redemption, yet the overriding emphasis remains the oneness of God. The early Christians did not abandon the Shema; rather, they re-centered it around Jesus:

> “Jesus is Lord” is a confession with profound implications, directly challenging every other claim to ultimate loyalty.

In the political-religious context of the early church, such a confession subverted Rome’s claims—particularly the lordship of Caesar—inviting persecution but witnessing to the absolute lordship of Christ.

This christocentric monotheism:

- Places allegiance to God solely through Jesus, the Mediator.
- Demands that all spheres of life are subject to Christ’s rule.
- Calls for a holistic, rather than compartmentalized, faith.

## Moving Beyond Sacred-Secular Dualism

> “There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry, Mine!”  
> —Abraham Kuyper

A genuinely messianic monotheism rejects the false separation between the “sacred” and the “secular.” The Hebrew mind acknowledges no such division; all of life is sacred when placed in relationship to the living God.

### The Problem of Dualism

Many Christians experience a radical disconnect between the God who rules Sunday and the “gods” of Monday. This results from a failure to respond truly to the one God, leaving domains of life open to the rule of false gods (e.g. the gods of wealth, politics, race). Historical examples such as apartheid in South Africa and the Rwandan genocide illustrate the tragic consequences of failing to bring every aspect of life under Christ’s lordship.

## Christology as the Heart of Movement Renewal

Authentic Christian renewal depends on a recovery of the primitive, unencumbered Christology of the New Testament: the confession “Jesus is Lord.” This unifying claim must remain central amid the religious “clutter” that so often obscures it.

A renewed commitment to this Lordship requires:

- Re-engaging with the simple confession “Jesus is Lord.”
- Simplifying core messages and focusing on essential truths.
- Calibrating church and individual life around Jesus, the Founder.
- Acting like Jesus toward those outside the faith.

It is Christology—specifically, the living center of "Jesus is Lord"—that defines and revitalizes the church in every age and context.

## Discipleship and the Integration of All of Life

> The greatest proof of Christianity for others is not how far a man can logically analyze his reasons for believing, but how far in practice he will stake his life on his belief.  
> —T. S. Eliot

> If you abide in my word and are truly my disciples, then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.  
> —Jesus, John 8:31–32

Every aspect of our lives—individual and communal—must be brought under the lordship of the one God, revealed in Jesus Christ. True discipleship integrates all domains of life, overcoming dualistic tendencies and embodying the message and mission of Jesus.

### The Role of Discipleship

All six elements of mDNA must be present for authentic Apostolic Genius to activate and permeate Christian communities and movements, but, apart from the central mDNA of "Jesus is Lord," discipleship and disciple-making may be the next most critical elements. C. S. Lewis was right: the church exists to draw people to Christ and to make them like Christ.

If the church fails here, it fails everywhere. Authentic movements appear, at their core, to be disciple-making systems—never content to move beyond that essential task.

---

## Conclusion

The recovery of Apostolic Genius requires the recovery of the lordship of Jesus in all its utter simplicity. This is where the church must constantly return for renewal. Jesus is our touchstone, our defining center. Following him means submitting every aspect of life to his rule and refusing all rivals, internal or external. True worship is lived out in this holistic allegiance—an arduous but central calling for every disciple.
