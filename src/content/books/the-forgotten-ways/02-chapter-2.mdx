---# Introduction

> "It needs to get the job done. He has designed his ecclesia to be the people who transform the world in his name—a cursory reading of the New Testament indicates that the eternal purposes of God are to be worked out primarily through the agency of his people."

## Dormant Potentials in the Church

Following the rebirth of the church in China, we can conclude that the seed of the future does indeed lie in the womb of the present. Every church claiming the name of Jesus has the same dormant potentials seen in the New Testament ecclesia, the early church, the Chinese movement, and every movement in between. All that is needed is to retrieve that seed, nurture the conditions for healthy growth, deliberately remove whatever hinders it, and allow the Holy Spirit to once again connect us with our Messiah Jesus, empowering us in his redemptive cause.

### An Illustration from _The Wizard of Oz_

To illustrate the concept of dormant (or latent) potentials, consider _The Wizard of Oz_. Dorothy, transported from Kansas to Oz by a tornado, seeks to return home. Guided by Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, she journeys toward the Emerald City. Accompanied by the Scarecrow (seeking brains), the Tin Man (seeking a heart), and the Cowardly Lion (seeking courage), Dorothy faces many ordeals. In the end, they discover they already possess what they have been seeking—the Scarecrow is clever, the Tin Man compassionate, and the Lion courageous. Dorothy, too, discovers she has the power to return home in her ruby slippers.

The answers are often within us; we need only to look beyond standard solutions, see past the veil of the familiar, and find the resolve to act. This story highlights the central assumption of this book: all God’s people carry within themselves the same potencies that invigorated the early Christian movement and are manifest in today's underground Chinese church. Apostolic Genius lies dormant in every believer and in every local church that earnestly seeks to follow Jesus. We have simply forgotten how to access it.

## Purpose of This Book

This book is written to help identify the constituent elements of Apostolic Genius and to (re)activate them so that the church might once again become a truly transformative Jesus movement in the West.

## A Sneak Preview

- A glossary of terms is provided at the back of the book for reference.
- Five appendices supply important material on leadership, change, and organization, drawing from living-systems theory.
- The book translates best practices in cross-cultural global missions to the context of the Western church—a "missions-to-the-first-world" approach.

Although the focus is on the mission of the whole people of God, mission is not limited to the collective activity of the church or denomination; it is to be present in every aspect of life and by all Christians everywhere.

This work reflects a consistent critique of religious institutionalism—not because institutions are inherently negative, but because rigid structures often assume the roles and authority that should belong to the people of God. The lesson from the Chinese church illustrates that "deinstitutionalization" can recover the missional potential latent within the system.

### Structure of This Book

The material is organized into two main sections:

#### Section 1: Setting the Scene

Section 1 explores the author's narrative to track the ideas and experiences that shaped this missional paradigm. These themes are developed in the first two chapters:
- **Chapter 1:** A local practitioner’s perspective, guiding a complex, inner-city church-planting movement through significant change.
- **Chapter 2:** A strategic, translocal perspective on the current missional situation.

#### Section 2: Activating mDNA

Here, the core concepts and the constituent elements of mDNA are described—elements which together activate the Apostolic Genius latent in the system. Those who are short on time may wish to jump directly to this section, but readers will be well-rewarded by reading Chapters 1 and 2 for proper context.

## The Irreducible Elements of mDNA

Albert Einstein said, "When the solution is simple and elegant, God is speaking." Following this guidance, the book identifies six essential, interrelated elements present in every Jesus movement that experienced exponential growth and social transformation:

1. **Jesus Is Lord**  
   At the center and circumference of every significant Jesus movement is the foundational confession, "Jesus is Lord." This simple yet profound proclamation resonates with the primal energies of scriptural faith and the response it demands.

2. **Disciple Making**  
   The irreplaceable, lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message. Disciple making is a non-negotiable core task and must be structured into every church's foundation.

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**  
   The twin impulses of remarkable missional movements: dynamic outward thrust and deepening engagement. These together seed and embed the gospel into various cultures and people groups.

4. **Liminality and Communitas**  
   The most vital communities arise out of shared ordeal and a mission that transcends themselves—initiating a risky journey and restoring adventure to the church’s venture.

5. **APEST Culture**  
   The active presence of Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, and Teacher functions (Ephesians 4). Especially catalytic is the apostolic role. This element relates to the kind of ministry and leadership needed for sustaining growth and transformation.

6. **Organic Systems**  
   Appropriate, flexible structures enable growth and movement. These operate with low control but high accountability and reflect a movement-network structure prone to spreading like a virus, unrestrained by centralized institutions.

Together, these six elements constitute the framework of Apostolic Genius.

## Method in the Madness

The purpose of this book is to identify the irreducible elements that constitute Apostolic Genius, using the early church and the 20th-century Chinese church as primary test cases. Observations are also compared with other significant movements in church history, and the elements are found to be consistently present in every transformative missional movement.

This book is written from the perspective of a missionary and strategist, not an academic. It aims to help church leaders and practitioners formulate a missional paradigm equal to the 21st-century context in which we are called to be faithful.

The book distills the essential, "meta-ideas"—the key concepts that unlock and control the others. While this means not everything that could be said is said, it ensures the big picture is clear: we are in need of a new paradigm, not just a revision of the old.

### Intended Audience

- Missional leaders and practitioners
- Leaders of existing churches aiming at the future
- Church planters and those initiating new forms of sustainable Christian community
- Leaders of movements, parachurch organizations, and denominations

# SECTION 1: The Making of a Missionary

## 1. A View from the Edge: Confessions of a Frustrated Missionary

> "If you want to build a ship, don’t summon people to buy wood, prepare tools, distribute jobs, and organize the work; rather, teach people the yearning for the wide, boundless ocean."
>
> —Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

> "A great deal more failure is the result of an excess of caution than of bold experimentation with new ideas. The frontiers of the kingdom of God were never advanced by men and women of caution."
>
> —J. Oswald Sanders

> "What we have is ... a pagan society whose public life is ruled by beliefs which are false. And because it is not a pre-Christian paganism, but a paganism born out of the rejection of Christianity, it is far tougher and more resistant to the Gospel than the pre-Christian paganisms with which foreign missionaries have been in contact during the past two hundred years. Here, without possibility of question, is the most challenging missionary frontier of our time."
>
> —Lesslie Newbigin

In true biblical fashion, this exploration emerges out of a narrative—a story involving God's dealings with people amid real history. In presenting the seminal ideas of this book, the author places them in the context of personal experience, shaped by the chaos and the communities served. The hope is that this narrative may illuminate common dilemmas faced by churches across the Western world.

## "South": An Experiment in the Inner City

The author’s most formative experience was with South Melbourne Restoration Community (SMRC), later called the Red Church, located in the shadow of Melbourne's central business district. Like many churches, it experienced a pattern of growth and decline before reaching a point of near closure in the late 1980s. The desperation of its situation opened the church to become the birthplace of an entirely new community.

The story begins with George, a Greek-Australian drug dealer and "roadie," who encountered God while serving jail time. His radical conversion, quickly echoed by his brother John, led to a grassroots evangelistic movement among their acquaintances—gays, lesbians, goths, drug addicts, prostitutes, and others. This chaotic, unchurched group of people began to form communal houses and a shared life, characterized by a near-tangible presence of the Holy Spirit and facilitated by redemptive pastoral leadership.

Eventually, this group merged into the more traditional South Melbourne Church of Christ, blending two divergent images of church—one traditional, institutional, and declining; the other grassroots, spontaneous, and vibrant.

## Stages in the Life of the Community

Three distinct stages emerged in this community’s journey:

### Phase 1: From Death to Chaos

Reseeding the established church with a new missional community was disorienting. The focus was on building an authentic Jesus community characterized by love, acceptance, and forgiveness. Without structured outreach programs, growth occurred as people clustered in shared living arrangements and the community extended grace to others. This was challenging to the original congregation, but ultimately the new form predominated.

### Phase 2: Becoming a Church-Planting Church

A sense of responsibility for those outside the church arose naturally. The group intuited a calling to reach people groups who would not set foot in traditional churches. This led to a strategy of targeting specific subcultures and a network approach for regional impact. The Restoration Community Network, born out of SMRC, planted six churches in seven years—some flourishing, others failing, but all significant as risk-taking experiments in mission.

As the church matured, it became known as a "cool church," gradually attracting established middle-class Christians—and, unwittingly, losing its original missional edge. Meanwhile, the formation of new movements, including work among Jewish people and the dance scene, illustrated the challenges and possibilities of cross-cultural mission.

### Phase 3: From a Church to an Organic Movement

Over time, the community became more self-indulgent and safe—attracting established Christians and losing its missional heart. A failed attempt to create a café/nightclub proximity space, coupled with a lack of conversions, led to a painful audit of spirituality and mission. The core assessment: the church had failed in the essential tasks of discipleship and mission.

## Missional Analysis: The Cultural Challenge

Research across the post-Christian West reveals that while interest in God, spirituality, Jesus, and prayer remains high, alienation from the church is significant. The prevalent church-growth model appeals to a minority of the population—about 10–15% in Australia, and up to 40% in the US. Most churches appeal to the "family values" segment but are less accessible to an increasingly diverse and secular population.

### The Strategic Dilemma

- The majority of churches pursue a contemporary church-growth approach, although only a few become successful megachurches.
- By focusing on the accessible minority, churches end up competing with each other for the same segment, excluding the majority that is alienated from these forms of church.
- Strategic innovation is needed: more of the same will not stem the decline.

## The Need for a Paradigm Shift

> "Albert Einstein claimed that the problems we face cannot be resolved by the same kind of thinking that created them in the first place."

The way forward lies not in digging the same hole deeper, but in adopting fundamentally new models and approaches. The analysis led to the formation of Future Travelers, a ministry journey that questions how churches can reach the unreachable majority. Hundreds of churches have now joined this journey toward movement-oriented churches in America.

---

## Concluding Reflection

The journey of South Melbourne Restoration Community, along with the strategic analysis laid out here, illustrates the urgent need for the Western church to recover its Apostolic Genius—not through organizational caution, but through bold, risk-taking engagement at the margins. By doing so, the church may once again become a dynamic, transformative movement that brings life to the center by living at the edge.
