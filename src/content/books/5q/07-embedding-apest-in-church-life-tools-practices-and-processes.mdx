# Embedding APEST in Church Life: Tools, Practices, and Processes

> _“We arrive in the parking lot and think, ‘How did I get here?’ It becomes automatic and unconscious.”_

According to Paul, the wholesale recalibration of the church and its ministry along APEST lines means that God’s people—now and everywhere—might _“attain to the fullness of Christ”_ and become mature. Maturity is attained through decisive, meaningful, and habitual actions, even when conditions are difficult and old habits come all too easily. Paul helped Timothy _“learn to drive”_ (cf. 1 Corinthians 4:17), and much is at stake—much more than simply learning to drive—so keep trying.

What follows are suggested tools, practices, and processes for embedding different aspects of the fivefold system (APEST) at the individual, local, and system levels.

## The 5Q Toolbox

Much of this book focuses on aligning our minds and the organizations we lead with the pattern of 5Q, a structure we've traced through theology, culture, history, Christ, and his people. While ideas are essential to human consciousness, transformation happens less by cogent arguments and more by generating new practices that shift the experience of reality.

To make ideas impactful, we must embed them into the rhythms and habits of the community—through common tools and practices.

### What is a Tool?

A _tool_ is a mental device or physical implement used for a specific operation necessary in a vocation or profession. Just as a saw is for cutting wood and a hammer is for driving nails, each tool discussed here is designed to deliver a particular result. Created by myself and my 5Qcollective colleague Rich Robinson, each suggested tool produces a specific impact.

A skilled craftsman knows which tool to use for a given task based on the desired outcome. Each tool in this chapter focuses on a unique dimension of APEST, so I highly recommend trying as many as possible. Each will prove useful at different times and in various parts of the process—try them with your teams.

> Remember: all five functions or callings are seeds latent within the system. Like the potential for a tree within a seed, our role is to cultivate an environment where the seed can flourish. These tools and processes offer simple ways to create that environment.

**Warning:** Before starting any exercise below, ensure each group member understands the basic definitions and distinctions of the fivefold functions/callings. For instance, don’t confuse evangelistic work with apostolic work simply because it seems entrepreneurial—entrepreneurial skills can serve any of the fivefold functions. Likewise, preaching (usually associated with the pulpit) is just a medium; APEST is the message. Be clear about definitions and distinctions upfront.

## The 5Q Systems Tests

There are two tests to help diagnose and assess the quotient of 5Q in your organization:

1. **5Q Diagnostic Test**  
   A straightforward assessment of current capacities in relation to APEST. It can be used multiple times to provide a diagnostic overview, similar to the “APEST marks” diagrams illustrated in chapter eight (p. 138). This helps leaders assess strengths and weaknesses and develop strategies accordingly.

2. **5Q Systems Test**  
   A more in-depth analysis measuring organizational awareness in relation to APEST. Based on stages of maturity and learning, it offers both a diagnostic and a complex multidimensional view, indicating the depth of both perception and practice. Both tests evaluate organizational functionality.

_I suggest starting with the diagnostic test. Once people are familiar with 5Q thinking, proceed to the systems test. Access these tests at [5Qcentral.com](http://www.5qcentral.com) or [5Qtests.com](http://www.5qtests.com)._

Additionally, Jessie and I have written an accessible book for non-specialists—**Activating 5Q: A User’s Guide to Understanding and Applying 5Q in Your Church or Organization**—which helps church leaders grasp the importance of testing and interpreting 5Q results. I recommend this book for all church staff and volunteers seeking to activate 5Q.

## Personal APEST Portrait

This tool focuses on developing an individual “portrait” or profile of each person’s calling by ranking APEST functions in descending order.

The most statistically reliable method is to take the online test at [aptest.org](http://www.apest.org) (also accessible via [5Qcentral.com](http://www.5qcentral.com)). However, a communal discernment process is equally enriching. I highly recommend both the test and the group process.

**Before coming together as a group, each member should:**

- Reflect personally on their APEST giftings (Ephesians 4:7).
- Using the agreed definitions (see page 99), identify their primary or dominant calling and secondary calling.
- Fill out the provided diagram: place your primary APEST gifting in the largest circle, the secondary in the next largest, and so on.
- Reflect on life events that connect to your profile.
- After filling in the circles, take the online test to confirm or refine your impressions.
- Journal insights to share with the group.

**When gathering as a group:**

- Provide up to 30 minutes for each member to share their portrait, feelings, and rationale.
- The leader should model this first.
- The group gives honest, loving feedback: is the portrait accurate? Can the community confirm or help refine the individual’s depiction?
- Adjust the portrait as appropriate.
- Pray for and affirm each person's calling, encouraging greater self-awareness and impact.

> _“APEST is called a Body dynamic. We only truly know ourselves in relation to others—in community.”_

## APEST Thinking Hats

Inspired by Edward de Bono's _Six Thinking Hats_, this exercise teaches teams to approach problems through the lens of each APEST function, without labeling people vocationally.

**Process:**

1. Define a team problem.
2. Work through the five thinking hats, each representing an APEST function:
   - **A (Apostle):** Missional extension, guarding the gospel, multiplication.
   - **P (Prophet):** Truth-telling, cultural depth.
   - **E (Evangelist):** Sharing the gospel, engaging outsiders.
   - **S (Shepherd):** Caring, nurturing, inclusion.
   - **T (Teacher):** Systematic truth, wisdom.
3. Each member must think from each perspective, regardless of their own vocational gift.
4. As a group, take turns wearing each conceptual hat and explore solutions accordingly.

_The game-like quality removes defensiveness and ensures all perspectives are heard._

---

## Base and Phase

This tool helps individuals identify both their primary ("base") APEST gifting and the "phases" in which they have functioned in other APEST roles.

**Process:**

- **Base:** Your primary, most comfortable ministry gifting.
- **Phase:** Other APEST roles you have operated in during different seasons, often prompted by circumstances or God’s guidance.

Paul says the purpose of APEST is equipping for maturity (see Ephesians 4:12). Everyone is encouraged to grow beyond their base, embracing other functions for well-rounded maturity.

**Exercise:**

- Place your base ministry in the center of a diagram.
- Note phases of ministry experience in the surrounding circles.
- Briefly describe your growth experiences related to each phase.

_We are rarely in control of which phase we enter; circumstances or relationships often guide this. Remain open to new phases and seek out opportunities to learn from others._

## APEST Inventory

The APEST Inventory helps churches and organizations inventory their activities and functions through the fivefold lens.

**Steps:**

1. Review the functions list (see page 99).
2. List all major activities of the church/organization.
3. **Tag** each activity as:
    - A (Apostolic)
    - P (Prophetic)
    - E (Evangelistic)
    - S (Shepherd)
    - T (Teacher)
   You can apply primary and secondary tags (e.g., “Ea” for evangelistic primary, apostolic secondary).
4. Chart these on a visual diagram.
5. Assess concentrations, deficiencies, and overall symmetry or asymmetry in the system.
6. Discuss causes and ways to fill gaps.

_Some churches, like Northwood Baptist Church, have cell groups check off activities related to all five functions during the year to cultivate balanced, mature ecclesias._

---

## APEST Perspectives

This tool encourages teams to approach topics through multiple fivefold perspectives.

**Process:**

1. Place an object, idea, or challenge (e.g., "gospel", "church", "culture") at the center.
2. Each participant describes what they see from their dominant APEST profile.
3. Group discussion reveals different facets, emphasizing the necessity of multiple perspectives for a full, accurate understanding.

_Use this tool for core values, problem-solving, planning, communication, or strategy building._

---

## APEST Pipeline

This exercise helps teams paint a picture of a competent practitioner of each of the five APEST callings and map processes for discipleship.

**Steps:**

1. Profile the ideal attitude, behaviors, skills, and competencies for each APEST calling.
2. Consider potential blockages or challenges for each in the training process.
3. Develop curriculum/content and a model process for discipling others into these callings.
4. Articulate core competencies required to "graduate" to the next level.
5. Transfer theory through coaching and practice to mastery.

**Leadership Development Levels:**

- **Level Five:** Mature, able to equip others.
- **Level Four:** Able to lead.
- **Level Three:** Able to fulfill all basic tasks.
- **Level Two:** Personal awareness of vocation.
- **Level One:** The undefined disciple.

This approach supports tailored but not individualistic development—always with the goal of organizational maturity.

**Example (Levels Two & Three):**

- **Apostle:** Mobilize action, pioneer new missional frontiers, focus on impact.
- **Prophet:** Help hear and know truth, foster cultural integrity, focus on faithfulness.
- **Evangelist:** Encourage gospel sharing, equip others, focus on communication.
- **Shepherd:** Nurture, demonstrate God’s love, focus on inclusion.
- **Teacher:** Create depth and accessibility in truth, focus on learning.

## APEST Training Environments

To engage with 5Q on an organizational level, consider the three primary training environments:

1. **Classroom**  
   Structured teaching on APEST callings and functions.

2. **Apprenticeship**  
   Relational training, where more mature leaders apprentice others in the same or different APEST callings.

3. **Immersion**  
   Experiential learning by entering environments where a particular function is dominant or where there is a healthy fivefold balance.

_Utilizing all three is vital for fruitful development of leaders in a 5Q environment._

---

## Assessing APEST Culture

A healthy 5Q culture requires attention to both structure and culture.

**Levels of APEST Culture:**

1. **Grounded:** Are all five functions understood?
2. **Holistic:** Are all five present?
3. **Balanced:** Are all five working together?
4. **Fruitful:** Are all five accessing synergy and leveraging strengths?
5. **Multiplying:** Are all five recreating themselves?

A healthy culture will show all five layers and move the organization—together—toward maturity.

## From Knowledge to Discipleship

Biblical teaching emphasizes not just knowing about God, but knowing God—and obedience is the sign of true understanding (Matthew 7:26; James 1:23). This obedience and imitation leads to discipleship:

> _“As Jesus’ disciple, I am his apprentice in kingdom living. I am learning from him how to lead my life in the Kingdom of the Heavens as he would lead my life if he were I.”_

We have been given APEST by Jesus to mature and attain his fullness. It is not enough to acknowledge the fivefold as good theology; we must commit ourselves to this logic and let it shape the Body.

## Learning by Process, Not Just by Answers

We often want quick answers, but transformation requires learning the process, not just arriving at the right answer. As illustrated in teaching a child math: it's more valuable to show the process than to simply supply the answer.

Apply this lesson to church leadership: lasting, fruitful change comes by embracing new theological paradigms and praxis, not just programs or manuals. Changing structures may take months; changing culture takes years—and it starts with us.

## Embracing Change: The Challenge

As you reflect on what you’ve learned, ask these key questions:

- Are you willing to relinquish the security of old thinking and adopt "soft eyes"?
- Will you courageously change, not just personally but communally and organizationally?
- Are you willing to pay the price to “learn again”?

The first step on this journey is repentance—a willingness to expand your thinking and adopt new truth.

---

## Stop, Look, Listen

Repentance is more than turning from sin; it means to "open your mind" or "expand your thinking" (Mark 1:15). Like the Green Cross Code in England:  
**Stop, Look, and Listen** before responding to new situations or information.

- **Stop:** Pause your rush to act or to resist new ideas.
- **Look:** Observe your context, yourself, and others with fresh eyes.
- **Listen:** Be attentive to how God may be speaking or leading.

After reflection, step out and act on the new truth—"believe the good news." Learning means not just understanding, but applying, innovating, and multiplying (per Bloom's taxonomy).

**5Q Challenge:**  
Write in your journal, reflect, pray, walk, read—do what you need to Stop, Look, and Listen for God’s truth. Ask:

- What is God saying to expand your thinking?
- Where are you stuck or have settled for less?
- How can this new understanding help you or others grow?

## Steps for the 5Q Journey

The journey of living out 5Q is not for the faint-hearted; it is stretching and rewarding. Here are key ways to begin:

### 1. Be Like a Child

Approach learning and challenge with childlike curiosity and faith—a spirit of exploration and experimentation, not rigid classroom learning. Children engage fully, learn through experience, and maintain "soft eyes" that see possibilities.

### 2. Be a Padawan

Embrace the posture of an apprentice. Like the disciples who learned by watching and following their teacher, we must move beyond information transfer to personal, relational, and experiential learning.

### 3. Be a Long-Distance Runner

Transformation results from repeated, intentional practice:

- **Discipline**: Do new things intentionally, even if it feels awkward.
- **Habit**: Continued practice becomes your default pattern.
- **Lifestyle**: Eventually, right practices become second nature—unconsciously competent.

### 4. Be an Explorer

An explorer relies on:

- **A Map:** Understanding and orientation (theory and information from this book).
- **A Guide:** A mentor who has journeyed before.
- **A Destination:** A compelling vision.
- **A Compass:** The Holy Spirit guiding direction and pace.

### 5. Be an Architect

Long-term change requires building strong foundations. Consider the five marks of the church (chapter eight):

- Missional impact (A)
- Covenant faithfulness (P)
- Gospel proclamation (E)
- Reconciled community (S)
- Deep wisdom (T)

Intentionally engage and grow in all five marks, set solid foundations, and seek out "master builders" to deepen your competencies.

## Final Encouragements

1. **Start Small:** Don’t be overwhelmed. Begin with one or two sustainable steps.
2. **Journey with Others:** Don’t travel alone. Identify mentors and companions for prayer, encouragement, and accountability.
3. **Stay Connected:** Engage with others journeying with 5Q through resources and training via [5Qcentral.com](http://www.5qcentral.com).

And the end of all our exploring  
Will be to arrive where we started  
And know the place for the first time.”_

## Appendix 1: The Cessation of Cessationism

Cessationists believe that the fivefold (especially apostolic and prophetic) functions ceased with the establishment of the New Testament canon and church hierarchy. However:

- **Scripture Writers:** Only a handful of the original apostles wrote New Testament texts. What roles did the rest serve?
- **Doctrine vs. Function:** Apostolic doctrine was never intended to replace the apostolic function.
- **The Original Twelve:** Restricting apostleship to the twelve does not fit the New Testament data—others were called apostles, including Junia (a woman) and Paul (not one of the twelve).
- **Functional Continuity:** The logic of Ephesians 4 posits the fivefold as essential, interdependent, and simultaneously present.

Cessationism, therefore, rests on later church assumptions and not New Testament teaching. The dynamic, living functions of apostles, prophets, and evangelists remain vital for the ongoing mission and maturity of the church.

_Soft eyes, grasshopper!_
