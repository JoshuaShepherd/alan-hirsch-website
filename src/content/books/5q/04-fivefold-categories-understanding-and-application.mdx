# Fivefold Categories: Understanding and Application

Grounded in God, woven into creation, redeemed by Jesus, granted to the church, and lived out in the lives of its saints to the glory of God, the fivefold (APEST) system is as deep as it is wide. The "meta-idea" introduced in chapter two gains a new depth of theological validity in this context. Viewed through this lens, the theological significance of APEST becomes undeniable.

The aim of this chapter is to make a case for seeing APEST as:

- An intrinsic part of God’s original creation order
- Woven throughout society
- Embodied by individuals who serve as exemplars and heroes within their culture

APEST forms part of what the Bible means by "archons": concentrations of power, core ideas, and cultural forces latent within culture, exerting an abiding influence over human affairs. Though damaged by the Fall, these archetypes continue to influence cultures and individuals across time and place.

We now shift from these universal understandings of APEST to examine how they are perfectly embodied and exemplified in the life and ministry of Jesus. We will see how J-APEST encapsulates the multifaceted dimensions of his person and work in a way that is both profound and elegantly simple. In the subsequent chapter, we will explore how APEST is given—bequeathed as ascension gifting—to the ecclesia, the Body of Christ. These "Body gifts" are more Christologically nuanced than the more general creational archetypes, as they are always expressions of Christ’s active ministry through his Body.

Onward to Jesus…

# Chapter 5: The Hero’s Journey—The Movement That Jesus Started

> If you want to know who God is, look at Jesus. If you want to know what it means to be human, look at Jesus. If you want to know what love is, look at Jesus. If you want to know what grief is, look at Jesus. And go on looking until you’re not just a spectator, but you’re actually part of the drama which has him as the central character.
>
> —N. T. Wright

> Our heroes carry our aspirations, our ideals, our hopes, our beliefs … This is what makes heroism so important: it reflects our own sense of identity, our combined emotions, our myths.
>
> —Rollo May

> Since man could not come to God, God has come to man, identifying himself with man in the most direct way. The eternal Logos and Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, has become true man, one of us; he has healed and restored our humanity by taking the whole of it into himself.
>
> —Kallistos Ware

An exploration of archetypes in human society parallels the idea that "myths" are foundational to both personal and group identity. Joseph Campbell famously demonstrated the enduring power of primary myths (defining narratives) throughout history. One key myth, which Campbell called the "mono-myth" or "the hero’s journey," is especially relevant to understanding the role of Jesus.

Heroes—whether real or mythical, living or departed—embody qualities prized by their society and serve as behavioral models. According to Campbell and others (such as C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Christopher Vogler), the hero’s journey follows a recognizable pattern and structure, present in all great stories—from Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings* to Lewis' *Chronicles of Narnia*.

## The Structure of the Hero's Journey

Campbell identifies three main sections:

1. **Quest (Departure):** The hero is summoned and sent, embarking on the journey.
2. **Ordeal:** The hero faces initiation, wounding, battles, setbacks, and various adventures.
3. **Return:** The hero comes home with the "elixir of life"—special knowledge or powers gained on the journey.

> A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.
>
> —Joseph Campbell

This ancient narrative holds profound significance for every culture. It permeates history, religion, and culture itself. Hans Urs von Balthasar writes:

> Divine grace … is secretly at work in the whole sphere of history, and thus all myths, philosophies, and poetic creations are innately capable of housing within themselves an intimation of divine glory.

## The Gospel as the Culmination of Archetypal Myth

Paul, particularly in his apostolic-missionary role, recognized the religious significance of myth as a metaphor for Christ’s death and resurrection. In Acts 17:16–34, he references a myth of a dying and rising god—likely Ceres, worshipped as the Corn King, believed to die and rise with each season. Paul uses this narrative logic to draw a direct parallel to the story of Jesus, leveraging the abiding value of mono-myth as a metaphor for the gospel.

C. S. Lewis, reflecting on myth and theology, notes:

> In theology as in science, myth supplies not answers but an experience of a larger existence than we can know cognitively. Such an experience touches depths the intellect cannot reach and conveys, to children and adults alike, the sense that this is not just true, but Truth.

J. R. R. Tolkien once suggested to Lewis that the gospel appears as a reframing of the Corn King myth, because "Christ was a myth that had become fact." Christ lived—and so fulfilled—the myth hidden within every culture. As Lewis scholar Louis Marcos writes:

> Perhaps the reason that every ancient culture yearned for a god to come to earth, to die, and to rise again was because the Creator who made all the nations placed in every person a desire for this very thing.

If this is so, it makes sense that when God enacted salvation through Jesus, it resonated with the deepest longing placed in all people.

## The Hero's Journey in Jesus

Once we acknowledge this archetypal pattern, the hero’s journey is unmistakably evident in Jesus’ story:

- **Jesus is sent on a mission, embodying the APEST identities.**
- **He suffers, labors, and gains followers.**
- **He overcomes and achieves victory.**
- **He bestows blessing—the fivefold gifts—upon his followers.**

In a word, Jesus is our true "hero" and the primary Christian prototype, "the heroic form, perfected man in whose image we are being remade" (see 2 Corinthians 3:18).

# Jesus as Triumphant King: The Ascension and the Gifts to the Church

Having identified the creational archetypes of APEST and the stages of the hero’s journey, we can now address what Paul calls the "ascension gifting" in Ephesians 4:8–11.

## The Ascension Gifting Explained

The imagery in Ephesians 4:8–10 is drawn from public rituals of the Roman Empire. When a ruler or general returned victorious from battle, the city celebrated with a triumphal parade. The champion displayed the spoils of war and distributed bounty among the people. The triumphal arches found in cities originated from this practice.

Paul adopts this archetype to describe Christ: 

- Jesus "descends" into the world, is victorious, "takes captivity captive," and in his "ascension" leads a parade, bestowing gifts upon his people.
- Jesus appropriates and redeems the unredeemed APEST archetypes from creation and remodels them in his own image.
- These "victory gifts" are then permanently bestowed upon the church, like a living testament to his triumph.

The fact that Paul connects APEST to the Ascension—a key event in Christ’s resurrection, enthronement, and commissioning of the church—gives APEST substantial theological weight:

> Therefore there can be no other basis for Christian discipleship and ministry than the resurrection; for it is none less than the ascending and exalted Head of the Church and of mankind who distributes the charisms [gifts] and missions of discipleship (Ephesians 4:7–11).

---

# Recapitulation: Reconfiguring the System

With the hero’s journey established in the pattern of Jesus’ sending, descent, and ascent, we turn to how he redeems these archetypes for the church.

This is rooted in the New Testament teaching of **anakephalaiosis** (Greek; recapitulation in Latin). Irenaeus and the early church fathers developed this doctrine: Christ, as the new representative man (the Second Adam), succeeds where the first Adam failed.

Ephesians 1:10 states:

> [God’s purpose is, in] the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up [Gk. Anakephalaiosis, literally “to restore in the new head”] of all things in Christ, things in the heavens, and things on the earth.
> 
> —Ephesians 1:10 (NASB)

Paul similarly formulates the gospel in terms of recapitulation in Colossians 1:15–23 and Romans 5. Stanley Hauerwas observes:

> The confession that the Messiah has been placed by God above and not within the cosmology and culture of the world means that under his lordship the cosmos finds its true meaning and coherence. In Colossians the powers are rightly understood to be not merely defeated but reenlisted in their original purpose to praise God.

Jesus consecrates history and culture in his own authentic living. Peter Leithart calls Jesus "the Father’s summary statement … the Logos of the Father—the logic or purpose in and through which the whole divine economy is conceived and implemented." N. T. Wright, following Irenaeus, says Christ acts as the representative who reconstitutes the people of God. Humanity is restored and history rebooted in Christ.

## Recapitulation and APEST

Applying this to 5Q: Along with all dimensions of humanity, the fivefold APEST archetypes are taken up into Christ, redeemed, and reconfigured through his perfect life and sacrificial death. In recapitulation, Christ becomes the new Head (*kephale*, *caput*) and is called the Head of his Body, the church (Ephesians 4:15).

Ephesians 4:8–11 teaches that Jesus takes the pre-existing fivefold archetypes and, recapitulating them in true obedience to God, gives APEST its definitive expression. Jesus embodies APEST as God originally intended, sanctifying and reconsecrating the fallen archetypes. In so doing, he "gifts" them to the Body of Christ, embedding them within the church’s genetic code as expressions of unique callings in different people across time and cultures.

---

# Jesus Offers the World Back to the Father

It is fitting within monotheistic logic to see worship as offering the world back to God. Recapitulation is where Jesus reconsecrates all humanity—including the fivefold archetypes—and presents it all as worship to God. The church is central to this offering that Jesus, as High Priest, makes to the Father. Through the redemptive ministry of the Body of Christ, Jesus extends his own mission in the world (cf. Ephesians 1:22–23; 1 Corinthians 15:21–28).

By ascending to the Father, Jesus bequeaths the reconstituted APEST archetypes to the community called to be his embodiment. We are perfectly equipped to live out his purposes. Each of us must remember the enormity of the grace we have received and live into his intentions.

If we neglect or distort the fivefold, we risk undermining the very design of the church and introducing a fatal flaw into its life and capacities.

# Chapter 6: Embodiment—The Fivefold Modes of Jesus’ Presence in the Church

> In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe. The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.
>
> —Hebrews 1:1–3

> The church is empowered by a certain communion with Christ which allows some measure of his perfected spirituality and destiny to be repeated or re-enacted in our lives.
>
> —George Hunsinger

> This distribution of royal gifts and ministries [APEST] is not a substitute for the Messiah’s presence but the mode of his being present.
>
> —Markus Barth

Thus far, we have focused on one aspect of Jesus’ work—establishing and equipping his people for their mission in the world. Paul’s teaching on recapitulation (anakephalaiosis) reveals how Jesus establishes the fivefold at the church’s core, but more must be said about his defining role in the ecclesia.

We look to Jesus to know who we are and what we are called to do. The church’s existence, identity, purpose, and function are all inseparably linked to who Jesus is and what he has done. As Bonhoeffer reminds us:

> Action in accord with Christ does not originate in some ethical principle, but in the very person of Jesus Christ. This is because everything real is summed up in Christ, who, by definition, is the origin of any and all action that is in accord with reality.

New Testament faith is about the unfolding purposes in Christ—Head and Body. The Holy Spirit enables faith to become "living and personal," rooted in the Person of Jesus Christ, and encompassing all he gives to his people as gifts. Jesus is God’s agenda for the church and world. He reconstitutes the world in his lived life, resulting in his church—the humanity God intended.

As the people defined by Jesus, we must continually realign with our Founder, Lord, and Redeemer.

## Jesus: The Agenda of the Church

Beyond affirming core Christological beliefs (his divinity, incarnation, exemplary life, redemptive death, resurrection, ascension, and promised return), we must examine how the aspects of Jesus’ person and work directly relate to his people, the Body of Christ.

Paul writes:

> For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
>
> —Colossians 1:13–20

This comprehensive language—firstborn, head, supremacy, all things—gives us a vision of the universal and cosmic significance of Jesus. The church is not merely an effect of Christ; she is his fullness and Body. Encountering Christ the Head includes encountering the Body—the two are indivisible.

Stanley Hauerwas states:

> The whole life of Jesus is to be understood as determinative for the whole life of the church.

Therefore, the church’s very culture and function must mirror Christ. Dysfunction in the church often stems from a lack of focus on Jesus. The life of the church must be directly conformed to the life and teaching of Jesus, as the archetype to which we are being conformed (cf. Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

George Beasley-Murray summarizes:

> The apostles were commissioned to carry on Christ’s work, and not to begin a new one.

## The Five Identities/Purposes of Jesus

Having established the centrality of Jesus, we now examine his ministry through the APEST categories, observing how he both fulfills and redefines them. These are best seen as five core identities or divine personas that Jesus reconstitutes and imparts to his people.

### 1. Jesus as the Exemplary Apostle

The term apostle (from *apostello*) means "one who is sent," an empowered, ambassadorial agent acting on behalf of a sender. Jesus claimed this identity, experiencing himself as sent by the Father to fulfill God’s eternal purposes (see John 20:21; Hebrews 3:1). He is the great Founder-Leader, sparking a movement of world redemption. His apostolic dimension touches on the purpose and mission of God in the world.

### 2. Jesus as the Exemplary Prophet

Walter Brueggemann calls Jesus “the fulfillment and quintessence of the prophetic tradition.” Jesus announces the "fulfillment of time," brings God’s judgment and salvation, restates covenant, and calls for repentance and faithfulness (see Mark 1:15; Luke 4:14-20). He is the Word of God incarnate (John 1:1–14), the Faithful One, perfectly obedient, and the perfect example of prophecy.

### 3. Jesus as the Exemplary Evangelist

Though less commonly highlighted, Jesus as evangelist is a clear aspect of his ministry. He proclaims and demonstrates the good news of the Kingdom. He offers every person and community an opportunity for radical reorientation, seeking and saving the lost (Luke 19:9–10). Jesus is both proclaimer and content of the evangel—he is the good news (Ephesians 2:14).

### 4. Jesus as the Exemplary Shepherd

Jesus is our High Priest, mediator, and the true Shepherd of Israel (2 Samuel 5:2; John 10). He heals, reconciles, and builds a new community (ecclesia), sustaining and guiding his people in love and compassion (e.g., 1 Peter 2:25; Matthew 28:20).

### 5. Jesus as the Exemplary Teacher

Historically regarded as Rabbi and Teacher, Jesus embodies the Way, teaching through example and life. He is the Word made flesh, the fulfillment and redefinition of the Torah (see Matthew 5:17; John 1:17, 14:6). In him "are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Colossians 2:2–3).

---

## APEST: The Onefold Medium of the Fivefold Message

Jesus is the exemplar of each APEST ministry. All five motifs are essential to understanding his life. In him, the medium truly is the message: He embodies the fullness of APEST in its perfected form, the defining fractal of the system.

When we examine Jesus:

- **As Apostle:** Sent, representing the Father, founder of the church.
- **As Prophet:** Word made flesh, obedient Son, herald of the New Covenant.
- **As Evangelist:** Good News incarnate, redeemer, movement maker.
- **As Shepherd:** Good Shepherd, reconciler, healer, defender.
- **As Teacher:** Logos, guide, wisdom of God, revelation and light.

These fivefold motifs are core to his ministry and together comprise his identity. The New Testament gospel integrates all these motifs—mission, prophetic call, proclamation of good news, adoption into God's family, and access to true knowledge—because they are first present in Jesus himself. 5Q is thus an index of the manifestation of his presence in his people; Jesus is the key that unlocks the power of 5Q as its defining center.

---

# Bringing the Head and the Body into Alignment

The remainder of this book will make the case for why the 5Q system is essential for renewal in church ministry and how it can be deeply coded into your church or organization. Christian ministry derives its authority and authenticity from its foundation in Jesus Christ.

The church is not only God’s redeemed people, but also the human agency by which Jesus extends his ministry into the world. The Body of Christ is the living expression of Jesus’ ongoing work.

## The Body Metaphor: Connecting Christ and His People

Paul's "Body of Christ" metaphor is critical for understanding the nature of the relationship between Christ and his people, as well as how 5Q is embedded into the church’s "genetic code." This metaphor requires us to "live into" its implications, making us more responsive to Christ.

The indissoluble association between Christ and the Church is captured in the language: Christ//Body of Christ; Messiah//Messianic; Christ//Christian. Hans Urs von Balthasar notes:

> While the church is not Christ, she can claim for herself and for the world no other pattern than the pattern of Christ, which leaves its stamp in her and shapes her through and through.

### The Incarnational Implication

Dietrich Bonhoeffer described the church as "the form of Christ in the world." Jesus was "God with skin"; now we are called to "flesh out" what Jesus is like. The church is the real presence of Christ in the world, a living sign of Jesus' activity. George Hunsinger writes:

> The church is empowered by a certain communion with Christ which allows some measure of his perfected spirituality and destiny to be repeated or re-enacted in our lives.

Augustine is ascribed this saying:

> A Christian is: a mind through which Christ thinks, a heart through which Christ loves, a voice through which Christ speaks, and a hand through which Christ helps.

### Christ as Head of the Body

The Body of Christ belongs to Jesus; he is its Head and the source of its character.

Frank Viola identifies five aspects of Christ’s headship:

1. **Jesus expresses his character and nature through his Body**
2. **Jesus continues his earthly ministry through the church**
3. **Jesus directs the church and its mission**
4. **Jesus nourishes his Body**
5. **Jesus is the source of the church’s life**

The church's agency and mission are bound to the person and work of Jesus. She is the concentrated expression of a culture birthed and sustained in Christ.

### Ministry Modeled on Jesus

All authentic ministry originates with, is shaped by, and is modeled on Jesus. Karl Barth called the church "the earthly-historical form of Christ’s existence," necessitating conformity to the life of her Founder.

### The Body as Symphony

Paul envisions the church as a symphony—many parts working together synergistically (cf. Ephesians 4). The Body is designed for fullness, maturity, perfection, and love. The church needs all of its parts to function as Christ intends.

### Agency and Function

A body exists to extend the purposes of its head. Similarly, the church is the receptacle of Christ’s power and represents him on earth. Tim Keller summarizes:

> Jesus Christ has all the powers and functions of ministry in himself; it is this ministry that is distributed in and through his church.

The Body of Christ is designed to extend the purposes of Jesus.

---

# Making APEST Unavoidable in the Life of the Body of Christ

The direct correspondence between Christ and the Body is reinforced by the sociological theory of the "routinization of charisma" (Max Weber). All movements begin with a charismatic founder, but for the movement to survive, the founder’s charisms must be distributed and embedded throughout the organization. 

Applied to Ephesians 4, by recapitulating and bequeathing APEST, Jesus routinizes his ministry and identity into the ecclesia’s foundation.

---

## Case Study: John Wesley

John Wesley, one of history’s remarkable movement makers, exemplifies high 5Q capacities. Wesley was:

- **Apostolic:** Movement starter and adaptive system builder.
- **Prophetic:** Advocate for social and personal holiness, abolition of slavery, workers’ rights.
- **Evangelistic:** Tireless preacher, mass communicator.
- **Shepherding:** Created systems of care for the poor and broken.
- **Teaching:** Committed to discipleship and prolific in teaching.

Wesley’s remarkable influence stemmed from embodying all five APEST functions. However, many Wesleyan denominations have since suppressed parts of APEST, leading to decline—the fatal flaw of "un-routinizing" founding charisms.

> Wesley is only a pale reflection of the original fivefold template exemplified in Jesus, the real Founder of the Christian movement. Wesley’s legitimacy stemmed from mirroring Jesus’ fullness in APEST.

A contemporary example is Pope Francis, who exhibits all five APEST functions; his renewal of the church reflects their ongoing necessity.
