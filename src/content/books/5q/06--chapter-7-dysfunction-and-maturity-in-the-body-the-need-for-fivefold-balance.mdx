# [Chapter 7] Dysfunction and Maturity in the Body: The Need for Fivefold Balance

> "If a function (or person) dominates the others, it must have a detrimental effect on the whole Body."
>
> —Briggs & Hyatt

## The Danger of Dominant Functions

Briggs and Hyatt observe that churches led predominantly by one type of leader, or characterized by a single dominant function, infuse the entire ministry and spirituality of the congregation with that trait. This creates an unhealthy bias and disrupts the spiritual ecology of Jesus’ body.

### Examples of Unbalanced Churches

- **Apostolic Bias**
    - Strengths: Break new ground, innovative, adventurous.
    - Dangers: If dominant, becomes overly task-driven, demanding, and alienating.
- **Prophetic Bias**
    - Strengths: Speak truth to power, justice-oriented, passionate in worship and discernment.
    - Dangers: If dominant, can become judgmental, overcritical, and unstable.
- **Evangelistic Bias**
    - Strengths: Heart for the lost, strong emphasis on outreach.
    - Dangers: If dominant, leans on marketing, can be shallow, pushy, opinionated, and aggressive.
- **Shepherding Bias**
    - Strengths: Loving, caring, relational.
    - Dangers: If dominant, risks becoming risk-averse, exclusive, overprotective, cloying, and co-dependent.
- **Teaching Bias**
    - Strengths: Wise, informed, committed to discipleship.
    - Dangers: If dominant, tends toward intellectualism, control, fussiness, and equates spirituality with knowledge rather than practice.

In each case, dominance leads to "precocious development"—an imbalance akin to a child overdeveloped in one area, to the detriment of holistic maturity.[^25] This over-reliance on strengths masks deeper immaturity, requiring intentional healing and integration.[^26]

## One-Dimensional Organization: The Problem of Reductionism

A leader or church with a precocious bias interprets all problems and solutions through their own lens:
- **Apostolic solution:** More leadership training and church planting.
- **Teaching solution:** More preaching and Bible study.
- **Evangelistic solution:** Bigger and better Sunday services.

This reductionism, often focused on sermons or Sunday events, ignores other vital functions such as discipleship, mission, and covenant community, resulting in disordered and immature expressions of the church.

> "This is reductionism at its worst!"

At best, this creates a narrow, obsessive focus; at worst, it can lead to groupthink, dysfunction, and even cult-like tendencies.

## The Call for Integration

For authentic growth, each APEST (Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Shepherding, Teaching) function needs the others (Ephesians 4:12–16). True maturity arises from integration—a "symphony" of all five dimensions.

### The Problem of Asymmetrical Churches

Asymmetrical churches attract like-minded individuals, which further entrenches their bias. For example, a teaching-focused church attracts those who only value teaching and alienates other forms of spiritual expression, resulting in groupthink or mass delusion.

## Summary Table: The Fivefold Functions and Callings

Below is an abridged summary of the APEST functions and how they manifest across Scripture, in creation, and in the Church (see original text for full detail):

| Function      | Archetypes/Heroes | In Christ        | Functions in Church      | Practitioners/Callings                            |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Apostolic     | Founder, Pioneer  | Sent One, King   | Missional leadership     | Church planters, Innovators, Entrepreneurs        |
| Prophetic     | Seer, Reformer    | Prophet, Word    | Covenant conscience      | Social activists, Worship leaders, Ethical leaders|
| Evangelistic  | Messenger, Champion| Redeemer, Savior | Outreach & recruitment  | Communicators, Apologists                         |
| Shepherding   | Caregiver, Healer | Good Shepherd    | Community builder       | Counselors, Spiritual directors                   |
| Teaching      | Sage, Guide       | Rabbi, Logos     | Curriculum & doctrine   | Instructors, Writers, Theologians                 |

> "Each of the five major functions is critically important to the health of the others. Each actually needs the other to make the whole work. (The church really is a body after all.)"

When churches have neglected evangelism, prophecy, and apostolicity—elevating only teaching and shepherding—the Body suffers.

# [Chapter 8] Marking the Body

> "People in any organization are always attached to the obsolete—the things that should have worked but did not, the things that once were productive and no longer are."
>
> —Peter Drucker

> "All our ecclesiologies are inadequate and out of date. Nearly all of them have been constructed in the light of a static concept of the Church as something given, something which already exists. Much attention has been concentrated on external 'marks of the Church.' ... As far as I know, no one has yet set to work to think out the theology of the Church in terms of the one thing for which it exists."
>
> —Bishop Stephen Neill

> "Church is not what we do; it is what God does, although we participate in it."
>
> —Eugene H. Peterson

## Seeing the Unseen: The Problem of Awareness

David Foster Wallace described two young fish unaware of the water they swim in, illustrating how the most fundamental realities are often the hardest to perceive or articulate.

Similarly, Christians often struggle to define "church" beyond simplistic or institutional descriptions. This lack of awareness reveals both a loss of biblical identity and the restrictive effects of reductionist traditions.

## APEST as the Marks of a True Church

The fivefold typology, rooted in the ministry of Jesus and the design of the Church, offers a robust way of identifying and measuring church maturity and effectiveness.

### When Is a Church a Church?

- What observable, defining characteristics distinguish a gathering as an authentic church?
- How do we move beyond institutional or programmatic markers to something more biblically substantial?

Marks (notae ecclesiae) are the observable, measurable characteristics that distinguish the ecclesia from other communities. Authentic worship, mission, covenant-faithfulness, and gospel-centeredness must be present and visible.

## Critique of Traditional Marks

### Catholic Tradition
- **Marks:** One, holy, catholic, apostolic
- **Drawbacks:** Tied to specific institutional forms (hierarchy, sacraments, magisterium)

### Protestant Tradition
- **Marks:** Right preaching of the Word and administration of sacraments (sometimes church discipline)
- **Drawbacks:** Reductive, focused on programs, dependent on clergy, institutionalizes grace, excludes key New Testament functions (e.g., mission, community, justice)

These reduced visions have shaped both internal and external perceptions of church, resulting in stunted, clerical, and often lifeless expressions.

## Toward Fivefold Marks: Reclaiming the Fullness

If Christ is the ultimate standard, and if the fivefold functions are the means by which his ministry extends through the church, then maturity and authenticity are found in the active presence of all five.

### The Fivefold Marks of the Church

The true church is:

1. **Founded on Christ’s Presence:** The people called, sanctified, and redeemed by God through Jesus Christ. All other marks flow from this "meta-mark."
2. **Apostolic:** A missional people, engaging in God’s redemptive work. Churches that live apostolically are authentically church.
3. **Prophetic:** A holy people, calling all to faithfulness, justice, worship, and prayer. The prophetic ministry ensures the church stands for God’s covenant.
4. **Evangelistic:** Proclaimers and embodiments of the gospel, bringing salvation’s good news into the world.
5. **Shepherding:** A reconciled family, nurturing faithful community and displaying the transforming power of resurrection life.
6. **Teaching:** Lovers of wisdom and truth, nurturing understanding, and communicating God’s knowledge for life.

> "Wherever the marks are recognizably present—missional impact, covenant faithfulness, gospel proclamation, reconciled community, and deep wisdom—there you have a real, authentic church. This is church as Jesus meant it to be!"

### Maturity through Integration

The more that each of the five marks is integrated and present, the more the community manifests the fullness of Christ. Spiritual maturity is achieved as all five functions intersect and mutually inform one another.

> "Maturity is increasingly experienced as all five increasingly intersect and mutually inform each other, thus experiencing the systemic synergy of a truly functional Body."

## Dysfunction and Its Results

Neglect or suppression of one or more marks leads to dysfunction, such as:
- Churches lacking the prophetic mark may become complicit in injustice.
- Churches that ignore the apostolic call may become static institutions.
- Churches without genuine shepherding become toxic and unloving.

Authenticity and faithfulness increase with the proportional demonstration of all five marks.

## Diagnosis and Strategy: The 5Q Systems Test

The fivefold marks serve as both metrics and diagnostic tools. Like an MRI for organizations, a thorough APEST profile enables leaders to:

1. Identify strengths and deficiencies
2. Set leadership and organizational strategies
3. Allocate resources toward neglected functions
4. Foster holistic maturity and health in the Body

**Action Steps:**
- Assess APEST expression in your community.
- Develop areas of weakness with contextual tools and methods.
- Celebrate and repeat progress in integration.

## Fivefold Instinct and Practice

Just as a child’s innate human potential unfolds with nurture, so every church contains the latent DNA for fivefold ministry. With intentional discipleship, practice, and leadership, the fivefold gifts can be awakened, reshaping culture, structures, and mission.

### Communities of Practice

APEST is best learned and embodied not only by teaching, but by communal practice—through habits, behaviors, and new mental models. Discipleship is participation in the way of Jesus, and the fivefold system offers a comprehensive framework for this journey.

## Levels of Change

1. **Discipleship Level:** Individuals discern and practice their fivefold calling through new habits and language.
2. **Church/Organizational Level:** Leaders embed APEST into the church’s rhythms, structures, and organizational culture.
3. **Systemic/Denominational Level:** Permission and strategy are granted for system-wide adoption and experimentation.

Developments at each level involve:
- Enlivening lost truths
- Legitimizing new concepts
- Repenting of obsolete frameworks
- Embracing change and risk
- Celebrating progress

This holistic rescripting of church life is essential for maturity, authenticity, and lasting missional impact.
