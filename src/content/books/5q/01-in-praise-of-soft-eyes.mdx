# In Praise of Soft Eyes

> "To look at something as though we had never seen it before requires great courage."  
> —Henri Matisse

> "One of the reasons, I believe, that knowledge is in a state of useless overproduction is that it is strewn all over the place, spoken in a thousand competitive voices. Its insignificant fragments are magnified all out of proportion, while its major and world-historical insights lie around begging for attention. There is no throbbing, vital center."  
> —Ernest Becker

> "You've got to think about big things while you're doing small things, so that all the small things go in the right direction."  
> —Alvin Toffler

> "You know what you need at a crime scene? … Soft eyes … If you got soft eyes, you can see the whole thing. If you got hard eyes—you staring at the same tree missing the forest … Soft eyes, grasshopper."  
> —Detective Bunk, *The Wire*

One of the reasons that knowledge is in a state of useless overproduction is due to its fragmentation—spoken in a thousand competitive voices, where insignificant fragments are magnified, and major insights are neglected. The idea of "soft eyes"—a way of seeing often attributed to Native American tracking practices—calls us to defer judgment and remain open. Whether in criminal investigation, medicine, mechanics, economics, or the arts, soft eyes are essential to discovery and innovation. Hard eyes, conversely, represent unconscious prejudice or bias, arriving at conclusions without truly seeing.

While most of us are not detectives, we all require soft eyes at critical junctures: in research, leadership, creativity, and problem-solving. Hard eyes—the unwillingness to see deeper or accurately diagnose—can be disastrous. The contrast between soft and hard eyes is analogous to the difference between synthetic (systems) and analytic thinking.

## Seeing the Trees: Analytic Thinking

Analytic thinking seeks to explain complex systems by reducing them to constituent parts. The key is "reducing": to scrutinize something, we break it apart and simplify ideas into formulas that can be commonly shared. Analytic thinking excels in stable contexts and when conventional formulas suffice; the stability of the whole allows for deep examination of parts.

However, during times of disruptive change, reductionism—over-reliance on details and routinized habits—can blind us to holistic understanding. We risk misinterpreting the partial when we lose sight of the whole, akin to the proverbial blind men describing an elephant by its parts.

Mark the word "reductionism," as it is a central theme; contemporary theology and the church have inherited many such reductions that block our capacity to understand the whole and respond to new challenges. Alvin Toffler puts it succinctly:

> "Lacking a systematic framework for understanding the clash of forces in today's world, we are like a ship's crew, trapped in a storm and trying to navigate between dangerous reefs without compass or chart. In a culture of warring specialisms, drowned in fragmented data and fine-toothed analysis, synthesis is not merely useful—it is crucial."

---

## Seeing the Forest: Synthetic (Symphonic) Thinking

Unlike analytic thinking, synthesis explains reality ecologically, understanding the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Social psychologist Daniel Pink speaks of synthetic thinking as "symphony"—the blending of disparate elements into a new, imaginative whole.

Symphony requires imagination, holism, play, and divergent thinking. True renewal—spiritual, social, or organizational—involves returning to the originating whole and rediscovering new meaning.

### The Symphonic Idea of a Bicycle

An analysis of bicycle parts alone does not equate to understanding a bicycle. The art of symphony is vital when grappling with big themes in theology or scripture. Hans Urs von Balthasar notes that concepts gain meaning only through their relation to the whole—isolating any aspect causes the total form to disappear. True meaning arises in the "art of total vision".

For example, eschatology is incomprehensible without reference to Christ's life and suffering; the Trinity must be understood as one whole, not isolated aspects. Heresy often results from reductionism—disjoining parts to analyze them out of context, which can never recreate the whole.

An architecture of wholeness—symphony—is necessary for context and meaning. The church needs symphony, not reductionist heresies, to renew its paradigm and invigorate its mission. 5Q, as introduced here, is a recombination of the apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching (APEST) capacities from Ephesians 4—a way to re-experience symphony in ministry.

## Eyes to Discover Truth, Goodness, and Beauty

Christian leaders will need soft eyes—an openness to new perspective—to navigate increasing complexities. The craving for easy answers, formulas, and stability has made our eyes hard, blinding us to deeper patterns and potentialities that God has built into life, the church, and the cosmos. Soft eyes are required to see beyond overfamiliar routines.

**Approach this book with soft eyes:**
- Lay aside conventional formulations of church and ministry.
- Be a "detective of divinity"—pursue the truth with openness.
- Avoid over-focusing on constituent parts; seek the overarching framework.
- Look for the big idea, the symphonic threads.
- Do not prejudge outcomes before assessing all evidence.

If you do this, you may discover ministry and church as never before—just as a stereogram reveals 3D shapes when viewed properly, new vision emerges.

## The Personal Significance of 5Q

After a lifetime of studying APEST, especially during the writing of this book, the author has come to appreciate a newfound beauty and significance in the symphony of fivefold-thinking—an elegance and potential previously unrecognized. 5Q is not a new invention but a rediscovery of something intrinsic to the church, a deep cultural genome awaiting articulation.

5Q is the capacity to see APEST synthetically: as a whole, a fractal part of God's design for both the world and the Body of Christ, embedded through Christ's redemptive work. It is a rediscovery—a latent potential in the very structure and being of the church, an overarching map fundamental to its purpose, calling, and function.

Like Kafka's assertion that a good book should be "an axe for the frozen sea inside us," this book is offered as an opportunity to unlock the potential within you and your community.

## The Role of the Guide

The author assumes the role of guide or mentor—Yoda to your Luke Skywalker, Gandalf to your Frodo, Morpheus to your Neo. The approach is more rabbinical: pointing out key ideas, being prescriptive as necessary, provoking and challenging, with a view to the reader's formation.

This guidance is rooted in scripture. The book is grounded in (biblical and systematic) theology to ensure fidelity to the Word of God and to enable the reader to discern its truth.

## Repentance: The Price of Admission to the Symphony

The willingness to see things in original wholeness comes at a price—repentance, or in secular terms, unlearning. All learning demands first a willingness to unlearn, to let go of obsolete ideas and open oneself to growth.

Breakthroughs come to those who break with mere convention. Only through unlearning are we capable of true learning.

> "To look at something as though we had never seen it before requires great courage."  
> —Henri Matisse

Relinquishing the (false) security of hard eyes means adopting soft eyes—a courage to change, to pay the price for learning again. Adjusting your view to embrace a bigger reality and repenting from reductionism is necessary for any true encounter with God.

> "To know God is to change."  
> —Attributed to Dietrich Bonhoeffer

If you seek transformational Gospel movement, unlearning entrenched habits and relearning authentic biblical ones is essential. Take responsibility as a leader—for your present reality and for necessary change. Refuse to let inherited systems define your ministry; redefine according to the Word of God.

We live in VUCA times—volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Church models inherited from past centuries are often obsolete, failing to address new contexts. The maps no longer fit the territory.

5Q is presented as a crucial key to systemic change, but reactivation requires both unlearning and theological relearning—recoding along the lines of the church's original APEST typology (Ephesians 4:1–16).

Repentance, both individual and corporate, is a gift from God. This book is offered as a guide towards fuller truth and faithful witness. May you have the soft eyes to see beyond obsolete forms to the beauty of a church functioning in its fivefold symphonic fullness.

## Briefing for the Journey

> "After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force. The movement is natural, arising spontaneously. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results."  
> —Ancient Chinese Proverb

> "The composition of this book has been for the author a long struggle of escape, and so must reading of it be for most readers if the author's assault upon them is to be successful—a struggle of escape from habitual modes of thought and expression. The ideas which are here expressed so laboriously are extremely simple and should be obvious. The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify...into every corner of our minds."  
> —John Maynard Keynes

> "When we suffer from [theological] amnesia, every form of serious authority for faith is in question, and we live unauthorized lives of faith and practice unauthorized ministries."  
> —Walter Brueggemann

The Western church, even after centuries of Christian history and periods of genuine breakthrough, remains largely unformed and immature in Christ. This is an alarming realization, especially as we find ourselves at a moment of unprecedented strategic significance and ill-prepared to navigate new paradigms.

The church continues to operate under outdated Christendom paradigms, trying to engage post-Christian and postmodern challenges with pre-modern maps—akin to navigating New York City with a map of Los Angeles.

Long-term decline is evident across the Western church. Predictive models suggest Christian influence in Britain and other Western contexts could all but disappear within a few generations. As leaders, we must audit the inherited ecclesial system—what has brought us here will not secure a viable future. As Einstein observed:

> "The problems of the world cannot be resolved by the same kind of thinking that created those problems in the first place."

A key symptom of the church's disconnect is the mishandling of the APEST typology; most cannot articulate the apostolic or prophetic functions, even though they permeate scripture. This blindness exposes deep deficiencies in discipleship and leadership.

A recalibration is needed—rooted not in organizational patchwork, but within the system itself—its very rationale and patterns of thought.

## Recalibrating the Church

Historically, the church has functioned with severely reduced categories: pastor (shepherd) and teacher, omitting apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic ministries from its operational life. The result has been a reduction of the church's fullness into static hierarchical models: bishop-priest-deacon (BPD), eldership, modern church growth paradigms modeled after business corporations, and so on. These often fail to reactivate the dynamic ministry present in Jesus and the New Testament.

As Robert Pirsig notes:

> "To speak of certain government and establishment institutions as 'the system' is to speak correctly... But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a [particular expression of] government is to attack the effects rather than the causes... The true system, the real system, is the prevailing construction of systematic thought itself, rationality itself..."

Applying new structures to patch a broken system does not resolve the underlying rationality that created the problem. True renewal arises from engaging with the deeper logic at work.

Reflect on how your church or organization may be captive to reductionist thinking. Is ministry viewed simply as preaching, pastoral care, and teaching? How does this compare to the New Testament church or historic gospel movements?

A more theological recalibration is required. Theology is the church's love language, enabling us to hear its inner voice and comprehend the transformational power of 5Q. This book intentionally grounds fivefold-thinking in scripture and theology for long-term impact and legitimacy.

## The 5Q System: Definitions and Purpose

**APEST Defined:**  
Broadly, APEST is as follows:

- **Apostle / Apostolic:** From Greek "sent one." The pioneering, missional function, focused on extending and maintaining the core DNA and organizational principles of Christianity as a movement.

- **Prophet / Prophetic:** Guardians of covenant relationship with God, emphasizing loyalty, justice, holiness, and faithfulness.

- **Evangelist / Evangelistic:** Proclaimers of the good news, storytellers and recruiters, catalysts for receptivity and growth.

- **Shepherd / Shepherding:** Developers of healthy, nurturing community; builders of spiritual maturity and communal health.

- **Teacher / Teaching:** Mediators and stewards of wisdom and understanding; responsible for integrating and passing on intellectual and spiritual treasure.

The fivefold typology offers a lexicon for understanding the Bible, the church, and disciples' purpose in the world. The distinctly Jesus-shaped version, or "J-APEST," will also be referenced throughout.

**Implicit vs. Explicit APEST:**  
- **Functions:** What I call "implicit APEST," the corporate purposes given to the whole Body.
- **Callings:** "Explicit APEST," the individual vocations or ministry expressions derived from those corporate purposes.

## The Turning of the Tide

Despite the current weaknesses of the church, the last decade has witnessed historic developments in APEST adoption across denominations and movements, both in the US and globally. While proficiency in fivefold practices is still maturing, the increasing use of this language signals a major consciousness shift.

For centuries, APEST thinking has been largely absent—suppressed by static, hierarchical paradigms. Its recovery now, as old forms wane, is significant. The Spirit is at work, preparing the church for its renewed mission.

# SECTION 1

## Mapping the Genome of the Body of Christ

> "The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us."
> —St. Paul (Acts 17:24–27)

> "Neither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light… If you want to change a society then you have to tell an alternative story."  
> —Ivan Illich

## Chapter 1: RetroFuture — Biblical Foundations for a 5Q Future

> "The problem of clericalism that results from that reduction [of ministry to shepherd and teacher] … is certainly one of the major and most daunting challenges that the Western Christian movement faces as it moves out of the protections of established Christendom."
> —Darrell Guder

> "All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come."
> —Victor Hugo

> "Things are pretty, graceful, rich, elegant, handsome, but until they speak to the imagination, not yet beautiful."
> —Ralph Waldo Emerson

The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that we begin this journey from the same starting point. Some readers may be new to the recovery of APEST thinking; the following summary of Ephesians 4:1–16 will provide both orientation and foundation for the paradigm that follows.

### Ephesians 4:1–16: The Key to Activating the Body of Christ

As the text that unlocks the 5Q system, Ephesians 4:1–16 is foundational for understanding the church's nature and purpose. Ephesians is considered the spiritual template for the church, presenting God's default settings on a primordial level—what some call "the invisible church," or as Eugene Peterson refers to it, "the church we cannot see..."
