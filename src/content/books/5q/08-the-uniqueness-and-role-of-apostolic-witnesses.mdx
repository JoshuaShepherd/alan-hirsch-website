# The Uniqueness and Role of Apostolic Witnesses

> "Ask yourself, how many other people also witnessed the resurrected Jesus? The answer? Five hundred! (1 Corinthians 15:3–8), plus Paul, plus the women in Jesus’ band, etc. So even that is hardly unique."

Recognizing that there are some unique and irreplaceable aspects to the witness of the original Apostles, it is still clear that certain functions—such as church planting, translocal networking, pioneering, and regional leadership—were bequeathed by the original Apostles as the inheritance of the church. The crucial issue becomes discerning the degree to which all subsequent apostolic functions reflect (without superseding) the unique, foundational role of the original twelve within church history.

In *The Permanent Revolution*, this process is referred to as extracting the “little a” from the “Big A.” In parallel, we must also extract the “little apest” from “Big APEST,” recognizing that all five functions are rooted primarily in Jesus Himself.

# The Logic of Cessationism: A Critique

Cessationists struggle to explain—biblically or historically—why God’s gifts and callings, so evident in the New Testament church, are seemingly absent today. They also cannot adequately account for the continual emergence of outstanding apostolic and prophetic figures across the ages: Patrick, Francis, Thérèse of Lisieux, John Wesley, Catherine Booth, Martin Luther King Jr., among others.

By arbitrarily excluding apostolic (and, to lesser extents, prophetic and evangelistic) functions, early church fathers effectively removed the very abilities necessary for the church to attain full maturity—clearly a case of self-sabotage. This reductionism was then passed down to the Western church as tradition.

It is reasonable to suspect that the underlying motivation for this limitation was less about theology and more about consolidating power within an increasingly bureaucratic hierarchy, moving the church under the administrative control of episcopal bishops. Such logic is profoundly anachronistic and willfully distorting the New Testament witness. From exegetical, theological, historical, and organizational perspectives, these arguments do not hold up. 

Thankfully, recent decades have seen a growing recognition among scholars and leaders that cessationism is, at best, an anachronistic interpretation of Scripture, and at worst, a manipulation of the clear New Testament teaching. There is nothing in Scripture suggesting that three of the five APEST ministries would cease, leaving just two expressions remaining. The church is to conform to the original design given by the resurrected, ascended Lord.

If, for instance, Paul—or any of the other apostles—were asked whether a Christianity without apostles or broader APEST was conceivable, he would undoubtedly respond:

> “What? Never! What am I? Chopped liver? The history of the church (Acts) is APEST writ large ... isn’t it? Besides, I made it absolutely clear in my letter to the Ephesians that these are *given* (aorist-indicative) as the victory-gifts of the ascending Lord to his Body as an integral unit of Christ’s ministry. A Christianity without apostles would be an un-missional Christianity and therefore untrue to itself. Why would I contradict my clear teaching and the church’s standard practice throughout?”

# Tradition versus Scripture

One cannot simply appeal to church tradition, such as the shift by Clement of Alexandria from the fivefold ministry to a hierarchical episcopate, as evidence for the obsolescence of the fivefold. While Clement may have acted as he thought necessary to secure the church in his time, that does not grant his decisions lasting authority—especially given their profoundly unbiblical and disastrous long-term impact.

Church tradition is not infallible or ultimately authoritative; church fathers were subject to the same vulnerabilities, prejudices, and fears as any generation. Were we to follow every tradition handed down, the result would be an unmanageable and distorted church.

The good news for followers of Jesus is that we are not constrained to uphold every bad decision from church history. We can—and must—repent, for Clement does not annul Paul: Scripture always trumps tradition.

# A Call Back to the Original Design

To address the complexities of our own context, we must return to fundamental patterns of ministry and leadership found in Scripture. The failure of the church to live up to its transformative calling often traces back to choices made and codified over time. In the spirit of *semper reformanda*, the church must continually reorient itself to the gospel and its Founder-Leader.

## Appendix 2: A Game of Thrones? Charismatic or Missional Approaches?

A separate but related issue to cessationism is the tendency to interpret the fivefold ministry through a hierarchical leadership paradigm, especially in the context of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) and within Pentecostal-Charismatic (P-C) traditions.

Many in these circles frame the fivefold primarily in terms of authority (*exousia*) and power (*dynamis*)—both for individual believers and the corporate church. While the pursuit of Holy Spirit empowerment is valid, applying this paradigm to the Ephesians 4:11 vocations constitutes a categorical error.

Within the P-C stream, conferring the titles of apostle or prophet is often associated with an aura of spiritual power and priestly authority. This can give rise to a cult of religious celebrity, fostering environments where leaders become untouchable and may dominate or exploit followers. This is not unique to charismatics; similar dynamics appear elsewhere in evangelical circles.

The gifts of the Spirit listed in 1 Corinthians 12–14 are for the empowerment of all Christians, but Ephesians 4:11 describes gifts from Jesus to the entire Body. APEST is the heritage of the church as a whole, not just for leaders, and is prescriptive for all.

### Ministry for All, Not Leadership for a Few

Where dysfunction emerges is in churches that identify leaders as “God’s anointed”—untouchable individuals operating within hierarchical office structures, manifesting authoritarian power. This misappropriation of APEST typologies as a warrant for hierarchical authority subverts the intended cruciform, incarnational model of Jesus’ leadership (see Luke 22:24–26; Philippians 2:1–11).

Instead, APEST must be continually shaped by the humility and self-emptying of Christ. Any co-option of these gifts to worldly concepts of power undermines the polycentric, radically non-hierarchical dynamic of the New Testament church. Ephesians 4 makes clear that ministry is given to the *entire* Body (v. 7), not just to a subset of leaders.

Notably, leadership is not even explicitly mentioned in the text; approaching Ephesians 4 as a leadership passage risks institutional dysfunction and division.

### Activating the Fivefold without Division

The way forward is to recognize APEST as the means by which the ministry of Christ is expressed through the whole Body, leading to its fullness and missional vitality. Paul addresses the entire ecclesia—men and women, slaves and free, every race—emphasizing that each member is apportioned a gift from Christ for the common good (Ephesians 4:7). Leadership should emerge from *within* these distributed gifts, not be imposed above them.

Approaching the fivefold with this Christological understanding frees us from the destructive power dynamics that have plagued much of church history.

## Appendix 3: The Exiling of the APEs  
*By Alan Hirsch and Tim Catchim, 2012*

> "The basic trouble [with the modern church] is that the proposed cure has such a striking similarity to the disease."  
> —Elton Trueblood

> "In a revolutionary era ... you need to learn to think and act like a revolutionary. People in revolutions who don’t act that way have a particular name: victims."  
> —Joshua Ramo Cooper

The recurring theme of the “exiled hero” in literature and film points to an embedded wisdom: sometimes the solutions needed by the community come from the margins and from those who have been rejected.

Likewise, the ministries of Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist (APEs) have been cast out of mainstream church life. The prevailing Shepherd-Teacher (ST) model of leadership, though essential for stability, has, in isolation, led to equilibrium and stasis—a condition akin to organizational death.

### The Dangers of Equilibrium

When the ST roles dominate at the expense of APEST as a whole, the church loses its capacity for adaptive change, missional engagement, and creative renewal. Jeffrey Goldstein describes organizational equilibrium as the state of least complexity—a place where any change is resisted and innovation is stifled. Over time, the resources necessary for renewal (often embodied by APEs) are ejected, leaving the organization incapable of change even when it is most needed.

However, these issues are not necessarily the result of bad intentions; rather, the ST gifts serve to build community and sustain faith. But as integrators and operators, Shepherds and Teachers are not equipped to drive missional movement alone. Generative, adaptive ministry comes through the interplay with APEs.

### Restoring the Necessary Dialectic

Living systems resist change and tend toward equilibrium, but continual adaptation is vital. Thus, leadership must be willing to endure necessary conflict and disruption in order to move God’s people forward. The vested interests, pride, and failure to recognize systemic issues can hinder change—but the Spirit’s calling toward mission must be awakened.

All humans are vulnerable to the misuse of power. Both APE and ST roles carry risks, but it has largely been the monopolizing of leadership by priestly (ST) types that has led to profound abuses and a loss of generative capacity within the church. This has robbed the church of its adventurous, missional character, leaving it defensive and risk-averse.

Christ’s Kingdom calls leaders to guide the church into the future, embracing risk and overcoming the impulse for safety. The Great Commission is not a guarantee of “safe” ministry, but rather a call to faithfulness amid challenge.

### Re-embracing the Exiled Ministries

Renewal requires a return to the foundational sources and a willingness to integrate all five APEST ministries—Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher—for the sake of the church's mission and maturity.

## Appendix 4: Threefold or Fivefold Patterns in Ministry

Historically, Christian theology has often categorized Jesus’ ministry using the Munus Triplex, or the Threefold Office: Prophet, Priest, and King. While these categories have helped many comprehend different aspects of Christ’s work, they offer only a partial framework for understanding ministry as it is expressed through Jesus and, by extension, the church.

The tri-perspectival model (Prophet, Priest, King), though an improvement over the simple duality of pastor and teacher, lacks robust biblical grounding—particularly when applied to the roles of believers (for example, the “king” office is difficult to justify for average Christians).

The most scripturally consistent and practically nuanced model broadens this lens to the Fivefold—Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher (APEST). Paul locates APEST ministry in Jesus Christ as the origin and source. The fullness of Christ is expressed in and through these diverse forms and practices, as shown in Ephesians 4:

> "To each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it … So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ... We will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work."  
> —Ephesians 4:7–16 (paraphrased and emphasized)

**Key Points:**

- The ministry of Christ is embedded in and fulfilled through the ministry of all His followers.
- Diminishing engagement with any dimension of the fivefold reduces our communal and individual ability to embody Jesus.

Living systems theory, as well as scriptural evidence, urge the church to keep all five dimensions of Jesus’ ministry dynamically engaged in its life and mission. Any reduction narrows the church's ability to respond faithfully to its call.

# Conclusion: Continuous Reformation

In a time of institutional decline and cultural change, the church’s primary calling is to realign continually with Scripture and the missional designs set in place by the resurrected Lord. Returning to the fivefold ministry gifts—understood christologically, exercised communally, and freed from the distortions of hierarchy or tradition—is imperative for the life and mission of the church. We are called, in the spirit of *semper reformanda*, to repentance, renewal, and faithfulness.
