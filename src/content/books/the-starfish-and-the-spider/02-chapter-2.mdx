---a tiny point of light, a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size.17 Pull back a little farther. Not just the earth, but the entire cosmos is like a speck of dust in Jesus’ hand. Back in Genesis, Jesus is the one took the chaos, what was formless and void, and ordered it and filled. Jesus turns chaos into cosmos. His wisdom and understanding has no limit. Each of us has an image of Jesus that hands in the gallery of our soul. We must understand how impoverished and warped the image is. It needs to be constantly reformed by the Word and by the Spirit. Jesus is so much bigger and so much better than we imagine. In fact, Paul says that Jesus fills everything every way. He is big enough to fill every need, big enough to be the solution to every problem, big enough to redeem every mistake, big enough to restore everything broken. Jesus is filling everything every way with all that He is. At the end of the story, Heaven and Earth will collide and comingle completely, evil will be vanquished, and all that Jesus is will fill everything everyway. As the church, we are called to be “His body, the fullness of Him.” This tell us who we are as the church and what we are destined for. Who are we? The church is not a building; it’s a body. It’s not a program; it’s a people. It’s not an activity; it’s an identity. We are the people of God saved by the power of God for the purposes of God. We are the body of Christ! What are we destined for? As we join Jesus, as His body, we are called to fill everything in every way with all the Jesus is. This is the most expansive vision for church one could possibly imagine! Fill everything every way? That’s Gospel Saturation. Let me be honest, there have been a lot of times in my past where my vision for mobilization is ,”Lord, I need you to fill the chairs in the auditorium, I need you to fill all the volunteer slots in the nursery during the third service, and the offering bags too.” The temptation for church leaders is to make the end zone of mobilization the organization of the church and its programs. If a church leader is saying, “Our Church is healthy,” …but the murder rate in our city is still high, fatherlessness is increasing, addiction is increasing, we’re not making any gains in universal flourishing in every corner of culture… Is the church in the city healthy? Perhaps the best Biblical word for this state of being for Gospel Saturation is the word Shalom. Neal Plantinga, President of Calvin Theological Seminary, in his book, Not the Way It’s Supposed to Be described the idea as follows: “The webbing together of God, humans, and all creation in justice, fulfillment, and delight is what the Hebrew prophets call Shalom. We call it peace, but it means far more than mere peace of mind or a cease-fire between enemies. In the Bible, Shalom means universal flourishing, wholeness, and delight — a rich state of affairs in which natural needs are satisfied and natural gifts fruitfully employed, a state of affairs that inspires joyful wonder as its Creator and Savior opens doors and welcomes the creatures in whom he delights. Shalom, in other words, is the way things ought to be.” 18 That’s the end game of the Movement Starfish: To fill everything everyway with the fullness of Jesus. We must begin with that end in mind, “What will it take to see that happen in my home, neighborhood, city, region, nation and beyond?” That’s what began happening in Jerusalem, in short order, after the ascension of Jesus. The early church saturated the city with the good news, beauty and justice of Jesus. That leaves us with this question, “How in the world did that happen? Multiplication is the Spirit’s means of moving us toward the fulfillment of Gospel Saturation. It is important to remember that multiplication is not an endzone in and of itself, but a means to an end. With that in mind, what are various dimensions of multiplication that yield a Starfish movement that moves us closer to Gospel Saturation in a given context? In total, we will argue that there are at least five, as in the five points of a Starfish. We will look at these within the context of the early church first. If you’re a not a church leader but a leader from another sector of society, consider what these various points of multiplication might look like in our context. We find the first two points of multiplication in Acts 5:4219, Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah. How did it happen? Houses and Hub. The first two points of multiplication. Hub, temple courts. Houses, house to house. Hub, more organized. Houses, more organic. Hub, gathered. Houses, scattered. Hub, resources for corporate training and city-wide impact. Houses, relationships for personal training and local impact in neighborhoods and networks. Hub, more formal. Houses, more informal. Hub, more structured. Houses, more spontaneous. Hubs and Houses, it’s the genius of Jesus. This Spirit-empowered church built their lives around a particular set of rhythms. They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Acts 2:42–4520 But again, where and when did these rhythms play out? Hub and Houses. “Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.” Acts 2:46-47 NIV21 All of it happened on a daily basis in Houses that also gathered at the Hub. The New International Version. . (Ac 2:42-45). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan. The New International Version. . (Ac 2:46-47). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan. Hub and Houses. Houses and Hub. If yours is like many faith communities, you may be thinking, “We already do this. We have small groups and weekend services.” Keep reading. We may be talking about something categorically different. The church in Jerusalem had a rhythm of both centralized connection at the Hub of the temple courts, and decentralized connection within the Houses. In the temple courts, the apostles taught, performed miracles, and evangelized. In the courts, the people of God learned, worshipped, prayed and fellowship within the temple structures. Hundreds or thousands could gather in the temple courts. In the houses, the church lived as extended spiritual families, in everyday gospel community, led by ordinary people, owning the mission of Jesus in their relational network. Let’s call them mircochurches. A couple dozen or more people could gather in the multiple-generational homes of the day, which gives us a general size for the microchurch. The Greek word used in the New Testament for those networks is “oikos.” The gospel transformed oikos into microchurches. The oikos were the major social structure of Rome. Oikos went beyond immediate family to include extended family, household slaves, and their network of friends, neighbors, and business associates. Rodney Stark, in The Rise of Christianity, documents the exponential growth of the church from 1000 in 40 AD to over 33,000,000 by 350 AD, crediting the simple church strategy.22 Michael Green, author of Evangelism in the Early Church, proclaims the central nature of oikos. Oikos, “consisting of blood relations, slaves, clients, and friends, was one of the bastions of the Greco-Roman society. Christians…made a deliberate point of gaining…households as lighthouses…from which the Gospel could illuminate the surrounding darkness.”23 Dan White Jr, in his book Subterranean: Why the Future of the Church is Rootedness, proclaims, “The oikos is the imperfect, messy, relational, organic but organized amoeba of the firstcentury church. Oikos was the hot mess of God’s in-breaking kingdom that supported early Christians for mission in a city, for maturing in love, for the practice of the Eucharist, for the collision of racial diversity, for resistance to paganism, and for being shaped as disciples.”24 The microchurches set entire oikos ablaze with the grace of God, like yeast in the dough gradually spreading and elevating an entire relational network with the gospel. By now, you might be sensing how different this is from what most churches call small groups. Unlike traditional small groups, microchurches are a pure missionary endeavor, where the gospel is planted into a network or neighborhood, new disciples emerge and form a new community. These groups are very proximate and incarnational in that neighborhood or network, unlike traditional small groups, that usually have people coming in from many networks and neighborhoods, who are being organized into groups by professionals. Because they are embedded into a particular neighborhood or network of relationships, daily discipleship and gospel community becomes the norm. This is vastly different from most small groups, which typical are formed for assimilation and deliver of content to churchgoers. In Acts 12:12, we are told that one of these mircochurches met in the house of Mary. The church in Jerusalem was a starfish network of microchurches, who also gathered at hub of the Temple. Those microchurches began to fill the neighborhoods of Jerusalem with disciples of Jesus. The gatherings at the hub where catalytic and empowering to the houses. The combination of multiplying disciples and microchurches (Houses), equipped by apostolic leadership and teaching in the temple courts (Hub), is what filled the city of Jerusalem. But don’t miss this, the starfish network of microchurches was primary. How do we know that? “And Saul approved of their killing him. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.” Acts 8:1 NIV25 In Acts 8:1, following the martyrdom of Stephen, the church is persecuted, and the public gatherings at the temple courts are shut down. Right at the point that the church ceased functioning because the Hub gathering wasn’t available. WRONG! The church continued to multiply disciples at an increasing rate across the Roman Empire. How did that primarily happen? Houses. Look for the word that is repeated in the next three passages. See if you can find the pattern. One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message. When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. "If you consider me a believer in the Lord," she said, "come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us. Acts 16:14-15 (NIV)26 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized. Acts 16:32-33 (NIV)27 Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized. Acts 18:7-8 (NIV) What is the word that was repeated in all three passages? The word that keeps occurring is ‘household.’ The Book of Acts records clearly how the gospel spread from one household to another, with many of these households being specifically named. We can see the microchurch starfish networks clearly by turning to the end of almost any of the epistles to specific cities. As gospel spreads, these starfish networks of microchurches, would form in a city. The New International Version. . (Ac 16:14-15). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan. The New International Version. . (Ac 18:7-8). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan. Romans is a classic example, where in chapter 16 Paul addresses different microchurches meeting in different households, including Priscilla and Aquila, the household of Aristobulus, the household of Narcissus, and so on. Leading NT scholar James Dunn comments on Romans 16, that these groupings indicate at least five different microchurches in Rome. The same is true of the Laodicean church, which apparently gathered in various places, with Paul needing to give a greeting to a specific group meeting in the house of Nympha (Col 4:15). Also consider the possibility of what could have been happening in Corinth, where the houses of Titius Justice (Acts 18:7), the household of Crispus (Acts 18:8), and the house of Stephanas (1 Corinthians 16:5) are all mentioned. Yet, Paul says “the whole church” comes together (1 Corinthians 14:23). Sounds like a Hub. That microchurch framework makes sense of virtually all the instructions given in the epistles. The “one another” commands about community can be best fleshed out within a microchurch. When it comes to worship instructions, “When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation, (1 Cor 14:26)” Paul was envisioning a microchurch where everyone in the room could participate, not a large corporate worship services with hundreds or thousands. When the church could pull together the households into a corporate gathering, they did. At the beginning of Acts, the church had a Hub in the temple courts. At the end of Acts, Paul is using the Hall of Tyrannus (Acts 19:10) as a Hub. Antioch, without a doubt, became a Hub, a place for equipping and launching of missionaries, before Ephesus. This larger corporate expression had a huge impact on the city of Jerusalem and the church in Ephesus. It provided inspiration, momentum, celebration, teaching, and a shared identity as the church in a city. There were apostolic leaders who provided oversight over all the microchurches, people like James and Peter in the Jerusalem and Paul, Timothy, plus Priscilla and Aquila in Ephesus28. Houses and Hubs! Long live the Starfish Church! But, in our world, autonomous, independent, Spider churches dominate the landscape. The driving question is usually, “How can I grow my church?” We’re obsessed with the spider expression of the Church. Yet, in the New Testament, we see the microchurches in the home, in the city, and in the region, working as one church, a Starfish faith movement, with multiple leaders and elder teams, interdependently networked as a Body. The driving question here is, “How can we multiply the number of people entering and experiencing the Kingdom, and the influence of the Kingdom, regardless of who gets the credit or increase?” Imagine our cities being filled the life of Heaven here on earth. Imagine developing a missionary on every street and a microchurch in every neighborhood or network of relationships. Imagine if every street had at least two people who said, “I will BLESS the people on this street! I will begin in prayer for each neighbor. I will listen deeply to the story of my neighbors and my neighborhood. I will eat with them. I will serve them. I will share the Good News.” The art of neighboring would be restored! New community would be created. That community would liberate our neighborhoods and networks from the loneliness, isolation and superficiality they are trapped in. Then, that community, like a bud breaking through the earth, would eventually blossom into a microchurch. Imagine what it would be like if a spiritual extended family owned the mission of Jesus in every neighborhood and network in your city. That kind of movement would be present enough, deep enough, and personal enough to actually transform both the spiritual landscape and the culture of a city, of your city. Imagine, the gathered church as a collection of those many microchurches, a Hub for equipping, evangelism and sending. Imagine those Hubs multiplying into networks, working toward Gospel Saturation in a city. That’s the story of the early church. As mentioned earlier, we will offer seven different versions of the Starfish, as a portable way to carry the core content. The first is the Movement Starfish, which will help us reimagine the Church as a decentralized network. # The Movement Starfish Five Points of Multiplication Multiplying Disciples (Owners of the Faith) The Starfish begins with disciples multiplying disciples. The critical starting point of any faith movement is flourishing and reproducing owners of the faith. Multiplying Leaders (Those Who Have Multiplied Owners of the Faith) As people begin to multiply disciples, they are becoming leaders almost without knowing it. As we multiply disciples and leaders, we get teams. The missional teams own the mission of Jesus in a neighborhood or network, then become the core for mircochurches (Houses). Multiplying Houses (Microchurches, Missional Teams, etc.) In my tradition, microchurches are spiritual extended families, living in everyday gospel community, led by ordinary people, who own the mission of Jesus in a neighborhood or social network. Some call them missional communities or organic churches. As we multiply missional teams and microchurches, we start filling neighborhoods and networks. In terms of size, these usually range in size from 12-50 people, who can meet in homes and live in daily gospel community. Multiplying Hubs (Centralized Expressions of Church That Equip for Disciple-Making, Leadership Development and the Flourishing of the Houses) Those microchurches connect with Hubs, so we can be the church gathered and scattered, like in the book of Acts. This may be a preexisting Church or, perhaps, the four or five microchurches come together to as a new congregation, that exists to equip the movement of missionaries and microchurches. In our context, as we continue to multiply Hubs by starting new churches or the reformation of pre-existing organized churches into Hubs, those reproducing Hubs become networks. We will do a deeper dive on Hubs a little later in this chapter, as we believe this is the point of multiplication that requires more effort to bring clarity on what true purpose of a Hub is. Multiplying Networks (2 or more Interdependent Churches Intentionally Working Together on Mission) A network consists of two or more churches working together in a city or region around a shared Kingdom mission. This may be microchurches or larger congregations, connected and working together around the Jesus Mission. Most cities will require multiple networks working together on different areas of mission like best practices in disciple-making, church planting, social justice, business as mission, prayer, poverty and the like to reach the goal of Gospel Saturation in a city. Those networks must remember, that at the end of the day, the most important function is multiplying disciples, not just planting churches or addressing social justice issues. If they want to a movement that can fill a city, it rises and falls with the ability to make disciples who can make disciples. 29 If you’re faith leader from another sector of society, or perhaps a leader of a non-profit, ask yourself, “What are these five points of multiplication in my context?” Perhaps, you can swap out the “microchurch” language for “working teams” and “hubs” for “HR department.” Regardless of your context, the mindset is the same, you need reproduction at all five points of the Starfish, if you want to be a decentralized faith movement. Before we look at the goal of each of these five points of multiplication, let’s drill a little deeper in on the concept of a Hub, as that will be the area where we maybe be most tempted to take what is currently being done in our church and relabel it a “Hub,” without making any significant changes. A Word of Clarity on the Function of Hubs as Revealed by the Coronavirus. As I write this, 3/4th’s of the American population is under a “shelter in place” order. My family is quarantined at home. We’ve all been blindsided by the Coronavirus. The whole world feels as if it’s changed overnight. With hundreds of millions of people on lockdown, how do we mobilize God’s people when folks can’t leave their homes and social distancing keeps us “out of reach” to one another? In the coming months, with this pandemic, churches around this country will find that they are no longer able to offer weekend services or any other type of large gathering without putting people at a significant risk. I’ve spent most of my adult life as a pastor in very large churches, so I understand this scenario has turned over the apple cart. Currently, we have launched a crisis coaching initiative. More than 1500 church leaders joined in a matter of days. I share this only to demonstrate the need church leaders are feeling for clarity on the church’s response in this unprecedented catastrophe. In these cohorts, you can feel the immense fear, anxiety, and uncertainty bubbling in the hearts of leaders, who are genuinely wondering, “Will my church survive this?” While I was serving as a pastor at a large church in Northern Indiana, that leadership team had a few occasions where we had to cancel weekend services due to severe weather. We used to live in what was known as the Snow Belt, where lake effect snow off of Lake Michigan could dump 6-8 feet of snow during a winter season. Worst case scenario: Canceling services two weeks in a row. We operated with a minimum of a three-week cushion, so the threat was minimized. Churches navigating the Coronavirus pandemic are looking at the possibility of not being able to have public services for weeks, maybe months. That’s a sobering situation, which may feel like an existential threat because of how the centralized church is structured. This is where we can begin to discover new clarity on what it means to be a Hub. When we say Hub, we must understand that it is not equivalent to the centralized form of church. This is where opening the hood on the Underground approach, initiated by the Tampa Underground, which we are innovating off of in Kansas City, will be helpful. IN KC Underground, we function with a two-entity structure, a mission agency and a network of microchurches. Our mission agency, our definition of a Hub, equips normal folks to be loving missionaries and effective disciple-makers in new contexts. We have seven teams that make up the service platform to equip and launch missionaries who plant the gospel. As new disciples are made in a new context, a microchurch emerges. At that point, you have an extended spiritual family on your hands. Our definition of a microchurch is this: An extended spiritual family, that is led by ordinary people, seeks to live in everyday gospel community, that owns the mission of Jesus in a network of relationships. When we have 4-6 microchurches in a geographic region or affinity group, we network them together in what we call Collectives. Collectives have shared elders, mission, and resources. The Hubs support the missionaries, microchurches, and collectives. We currently have one Hub in our city but envision a day where we will have 12 or more throughout the city. A Hub does have a physical location, an office that services as co-working space for the missionaries and microchurch leaders, as well as for, the seven equipping teams. In a city of 2.2 million, we want every missionary and microchurch leader to have easy access to a Hub, with its services and support proximate to them. We are attempting to reimagine church as a decentralized network. When the Coronavirus hit, by God’s grace we were able to pivot quickly. I knew I needed to write a letter to our microchurch leaders and the faithful missionaries in our movement to keep them abreast on our response to this crisis. As I wrote that letter, I realized that the form of church we equip for, the microchurch, is perfectly positioned for this type of culture moment. My letter became less of a warning about what we “can’t do” anymore, and more of a rally cry for all the things we “can do” as a movement of microchurches. We quickly gave free access to a video conferencing platform to all our microchurches. All the microchurches leaned in, dramatically increased both frequency of community touches and community depth, as they rallied as spiritual extended families. Secondly, the Hub increased activity and equipping because it’s not bound by a building or service in a particular location. For example, the Hub offers a weekly equipping gathering for all the missionaries and microchurch leaders. This is not a weekend service, but a combination of inspiration, story-telling, and practical equipping for leaders. It’s very conversational and interactive. We moved that gathering online immediately and saw an increase in attendance and participation. The liminal space of the crisis catalyzed creativity and new initiatives through our microchurch leaders as they shared their ideas. They don’t need us to tell them what to do. For example, a number of our missionaries immediately launched new online Discovery Bible Studies, inviting new people from their neighborhoods and networks to join them to find community and comfort in the storm. New disciples of Jesus have begun to emerge immediately. We’ve seen two new microchurches emerge in the last two weeks of the crisis! This is actually accelerating us in mission. 95% of our giving is online, as we don’t collect offerings in microchurches, and as I am writing this, six weeks into the pandemic, we’ve not seen a dip in giving, as of yet. The church as a decentralized network is almost invulnerable to any pandemic or crisis. Historian Rodney Stark, in his book The Rise of Christianity, notes that the pandemics that caused social chaos in the Empire in the early days of the church actually fueled both the viral growth of the church and the depth of community in the households of faith, what we call microchurches. As others abandoned family or friends and bunkered down in fear, the households of faith led by ordinary people engaged the sick and the suffering. Their communal love and witness convinced the world that the Good News of Jesus was real and for everyone. May this be our story in these coming days! The fact of the matter, whether church leaders wanted it or not, when the pandemic hit, they were forced to reimagine their church as a decentralized network of disciples and micro expressions of the church. We know theologically, the church is not a building, it’s a body. The church is nor place or program, it’s a people. It’s not an event, but everyday people living out the mission of Jesus in every area of life and everywhere they go. But the COVID-19 Crisis made us experience those ideas literally. Yes, the church has buildings, places, programs and events. But we don’t have to have those. They don’t define us. The Church is not an activity, but an Identity. Now, that those “tools” have been removed; we are forced to reimagine what the Church is without those things. A centralized church builds upon the centralizing elements of a building, an event, a program, or a highly gifted teacher. Decentralized church builds around network of multiplying disciples, leaders and micro expressions in multiple locations. What the corona virus revealed is how very vulnerable the centralized form of church is. Our buildings, programs and events were wiped off the board in a matter of days. In the first few weeks of the crisis, many church leaders scrambled to move their services online or to upgrade the online experience as the most important strategy because that is essential for the centralized form of church. I’m for having “the voice” of the church being broadcast to her people. And yet, if done without reflection, as an end in and of itself, we are still using the same rubric of “centralized delivery of religious goods and services” as our main strategy. That play will still leave us vulnerable and far from the movemental form of church. “The medium is the message,” as the saying goes. In the crisis coaching, we emphasized a different response. First, we offered two theological reminders the Church rests on. Then, we encouraged two priority pivots for action. Reminder #1: Our God is Unchanging. Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. Heaven is not panicked, neither should we be. Jesus is seated on His throne. He’s not up pacing back and forth. He is seated on His throne and because of that our foundation is joy and shalom. He will lead us through this together, as we listen to His voice and obey. So, begin with prayer, fasting, and repentance. May we will only go forward as fast as we can on our knees, in totally God-dependency. Put the oxygen mask on yourself first, breathe in the Gospel and quiet yourself in His presence. Reminder #2: Our mission is Unchanging. Make disciples who make disciples. This crisis environment is actually a richer environment for disciple-making because people are living with a real awareness of eternal realities. For example, we are always hanging on a thread between life and death. But most of the time we can ignore it. Not anymore. Most of time, we live with the illusion of control. Not anymore. Most of the time, we can distract ourselves and keep ourselves busy, but no longer. The desperate need for authentic community will be so palpable in lockdown. I saw a picture on Instagram of a pastor who was going to buy supplies. Of course, half the shelves were empty. But you know what he else he noticed? He had posted a picture of the book section of Walmart where the Bibles are. All of them were gone. Not one left. That reveals the unparalleled hunger for spiritual truth during this pandemic. Thus far, this the most potent opportunity for disciplemaking in our lifetime! So, how do we leverage this opportunity. Priority #1: Pivot to small groups (starfish) harder than you pivot to streaming services. More than great content, what people need right now is great community. As helpful as streaming services is, what people need the most in a crisis isn’t more great content (there’s a glut of great content already), but great Jesus-centered community to sustain them. The second wave of response that is now beginning to unfold, is a great effort to move whatever form of micro a church has (small groups, life groups, etc.) online to videoconferencing platforms like zoom. That’s brilliant. Reimagine church as a decentralized network of micro expressions of church. Years ago, I remember hearing Alan Hirsch share a chess analogy that is so pertinent today. If you want to learn how to play chess, you should start by removing your own queen. Once you’ve mastered the game without the most powerful piece, then put the queen back in and see how good you are! Alan says, for the church, the Sunday service in a building is our queen. We’ve been relying on it too much. Now that the queen has been taken off the board it’s time to rediscover what all the other pieces can do. The Harvest is ready to be brought into the barns. The fish are jumping into the boat. But the barns and the boats are not your church building. They are not your online streaming services. The barns and the boats are those micro-expressions of the church, the small groups where people can truly be a part of the family of God, in an embodied way (and for now), even in a virtual space. Priority #2: Pivot to current staff to equipping the leaders that lead those micro-expressions. As I mentioned earlier, in the Underground, we offer a weekly equipping gathering for the leaders of the microchurches. We moved that equipping gathering online seamlessly, where they get in working huddles in breakout rooms. That’s a virtual recreation of what we had been doing when we met in one location. In addition, every microchurch leader in our movement has a coach. Our coaches are increasing their connection with those leaders. All seven of our equipping teams, because they are built on a coaching model, can operate at 100% capacity, totally unhindered in this crisis. Wise church leaders are realizing, “The staff I had to support all the centralized programs and services of the church now have to be redeployed to become coaches to equip those who are leading these micro expressions! That’s job one!” When crisis hits, we find out what is essential. If this crisis is forcing the prevailing model to reorganize to prioritize smaller groups, emphasize equipping and leadership development, and the decentralizing of power, giving and mission as essential. Then, perhaps, micro and equipping toward that end is the most essential expression of church all the time. That leads to the real purpose of a Hub: equipping ordinary people to be loving missionaries, effective disciple-makers and spiritual parents of microchurches. If you consider what was really happening with the apostolic influence in the Temple Courts and Hall of Tyrannus, do you think it was people gathering to consume a Christian Ted talk, sing a few songs, and then rinse and repeat next week? Or, in fact, did Paul use that Hall to equip missionary disciple-makers who spread out all over that region of the Roman Empire to plant the gospel and see new microchurches and networks emerge? The answer is in the Book, for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. Hubs can be independent of congregations, like they are in the KC Underground. Our Collectives (networks of microchurches) operate like congregations with shared worship gatherings (1-2 per month) and shared leadership. The Hubs support the Collectives by equipping the missionaries and microchurches within them. We are more at the Starfish end of the continuum, a Starder. Or Hubs can exist within a larger organized expression of Church. Those within the prevailing model can transition by creating a new “mission agency” inside the church and make that an essential part of their framework. That would be more at the Spider end of the continuum, a Spiderfish. I think we need both to get the job done. Either way, we can equip to see multiplication happening at all five points: Disciples, Leaders, House, Hubs, and Networks. Let’s look now to see what exactly we mean by movement. Movement is one of the latest buzzwords in church leadership world. Now, everything is a movement. When everything is a movement, then nothing is a movement. Words matter. Definitions matters. In one sense, a movement is anything that moves. We get that. However, we are seeking to ground the Movement Starfish definition in the more than forty years of analysis of the greatest movements in the history of church that have occurred in our lifetime. These Disciple-Making Movements (DMM) and Church Planting Movements (CPM) have been documented and researched in such seminal works as Church Planting Movements by David Garrison or Miraculous Movements by Jerry Trousdale, along with the work of David Watson through Cityteam and then New Generations, who has been instrumental in starting over 100 DMM’s globally through his training of local leaders. It would seem foolish to ignore the clear definition for movement that has emerged from the CPM and DMM world, where we can learn from the church in her finest expression around the world. In his book, Garrison defines it in the following way, A CPM is a rapid and multiplicative increase of indigenous churches planting churches within a given people group or population segment.30 Three key points to note: It’s rapid and viral. Momentum grows and appear out of control. It’s multiplicative, not growth by addition. It’s indigenous. The church planting doesn’t occur because outsiders come in (although they may be catalytic in the early stages) but because local, indigenous people are making new disciples that form new churches. This indigenous movements start with extraordinary prayer and fasting, focus on obedience-based discipleship, discovery forms of Bible engagement, passionate and fearless sharing of the Gospel, authority is decentralized so finding the “top leader” feels impossible, and the form of church is small, simple and easy to produce. It’s further defined by David Watson as having at least 100 churches, at least three generations deep31. How do DMM’s and CPM’s relate? Roy Moran, another fellow Kansas City native, who is a mentor and a recognized expert on both, provides this answer, “The term disciple making movements…is what started the process. While Garrison was describing the result – planting churches – the New Generations tribe preferred to describe the process – disciple making. Multiplying churches was the result.”32 A great many people have co-opted the labels, Church Planting Movements and Disciple-Making Movements, redefining them in any which way that serves them. The authors desire is to build on the foundation of these hard-fought, well-founded definitions. 31 http://www.davidlwatson.org/2009/06/15/church-planting-movement-cpm-–-our-definition/ 32 https://discipleship.org/bobbys-blog/disciple-making-movements-part-1/ The Goal of Movement Starfish: Four Generations of Reproduction on Multiple Strands at All Five Points. The goal in each of these aspects of the Movement Starfish– disciples, leaders, houses, hubs, and networks – is reproduction to the fourth generation and beyond, on more than one strand. And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others. 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul (Generation 1) to Timothy (Generation 2) to Reliable People (Generation 3) to Others (Generation 4). Since we are all called to be disciples who make disciples, that means every disciple is called to initiate more than one strand of four generation multiplication. In the illustration to the right, you can see what a four generation on multiple strand disciplemaking movement looks like. When we see four generations of reproduction on multiple strands in each of these areas – disciples, leaders, houses, hubs, and networks, you have a genuine movement on your hands. The good things are officially running wild. Jesus’ plan from the very beginning: Reproduce at every level. If we keep reproducing at every level consistently, eventually we get to multiplication. Multiplication will produce an unstoppable, transforming faith movement in your city and region. Here in Kansas City, we are working on environments and tools for multiplication for each on these points of the Movement Starfish. We will explore those with the Owner-Making Ingredient Starfish and the Owner-Making Ecosystem Starfish in the second half of the book. We’ll share the story of one Disciple-Making Movement from our city that has multiplied disciples out past the fourth, fifth and sixth generation on multiple strands, more than four thousand people. It’s all life on life, grassroots, bottom-up. We are encouraged to see more examples emerging in the West in our day Cory Ozbun, my friend and partner in the KC Underground, who is a such a catalytic leader in our city, describes the journey toward the Movement Starfish this way – First, mindset. Next, momentum. Then, Movement. It starts with the right mindset: Multiply Disciples with the Vision of Gospel Saturation. Then, as disciple make disciples, eventually leaders and microchurches multiply, with Hubs and Networks following in suit. If things are moving that way, but you’ve not yet reached four generations on multiple strands, you have momentum. Momentum is good! For example, we saw a 400% increase in microchurches this last year in the KC Underground, most of that was by multiplication, along with a few adoptions. By God’s grace, that’s momentum! But we’re not a movement yet, not until we hit four generations on multiple strands, with a holistic vision of all five points of multiplication. We believe that the Movement Starfish is not just meant for national church planting movements or large networks like NewThing, Acts 29, ARC, and the like. This kind of movement always starts with a handful of disciples. In other words, you and your friends could be the catalyst for a Starfish movement. A small or medium-sized congregation could be unleashed this way with the right kind of leadership. Using a dated metaphor from my teen years, this is an “all skate.” Everyone gets to play. Large faith organizations could be reimagined this way. As nature has shown us, evolution is necessary to change from a Spider to a Starfish. Adaptive changes can create new forms. This brings us to the hybrids again: Spiderfish and Starders. There are two types of hybrids: The Spiderfish and the Starder. The first type of hybrid, the Spiderfish, is a more centralized institution that decentralizes parts of their organization. They will lean more heavily into centralization of staffing, teaching, resources, but are willing to decentralize certain aspects like local or global missions or microchurches. The second type of hybrid, the Starder, is a more decentralized approach that centralizes as little as they deem necessary in the pursuit of gospel saturation in a city or region. By far, the most practical and helpful outworking of these hybrid approaches within the context of the evangelical church in America that we have seen are described in MultiChurch: Exploring the Future of Multisite by Brad House and Gregg Allison. You’ll see how their Multisite/Multichurch Spectrum overlaps perfectly with our Spider/Starfish Continuum. Those authors have provided a clear vocabulary for us to be able to describe the journey from centralized expressions of church to decentralized expressions of church. In simple terms, a multichurch is one church made up of multiple interdependent churches. These churches have a form of polity, or locus of power, that provides the opportunity and authority to make decentralized decisions about budget, contextualization of ministries, leadership and more. A multichurch is a network of disciples who multiply their influence by launching, developing, and resourcing a network of multiple congregations to reach its city with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Whereas, a multisite approach is typically one church with multiple locations and services, but locus of power leans toward centralization of budgets, branding, decision-making, and the like.33 As you can see there are seven different models along the spectrum: Pillar: One church with a single service Gallery: One church expanded to multiple services and/or venues. Franchise: One church cloned to multiple sites. Federation: One church contextualized in multiple locations. Cooperative: One church made up of multiple interdependent churches. Collective: A collection of churches collaborating as one church. Network: Individual churches joining together for a common goal and support. This book is designed for leaders who finds themselves drawn toward the middle of the continuum, with a strong gravitational pull towards the Starfish end the continuum. If you find yourself in a Pillar or Gallery, but you’d love to get to the Spiderfish territory of the Federation model, keep reading. If, right now, you find yourself leading a Franchise model, but the Spirit is leading you to Starder territory, by moving to a Federation model next, and perhaps, a Cooperative model after that, we hope to be helpful guides. If you’re a church planter, and you already know that God has placed a vision in your heart for a Collective, then it is our great hope that this book, by God’s grace, will shorten your learning curve and speed up your timeline. The remainder of the book will provide ways of thinking and practical tools, each encapsulated in a different starfish, that will move faith communities toward the decentralized end of the continuum. As with all sustained change, before we can talk about structural reformation in the church you lead, we need to speak first to personal reformation in the soul and life of the leader. Let’s first discover what it means to be the Light Load Leader. # Section Two A Culture Chapter 4 The Light Load Leader Starfish Distributing the Weight Life at the top of the pyramids isn’t much more fulfilling. Behind the facade and the bravado, the lives of powerful corporate leaders are ones of quiet suffering too. –Frederic Laloux Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” –Matt. 11:28-30 (ESV) Meeting at a local coffee shop, I (Lance) and Steven, the founding pastor of a church that had grown to around 1100 members, sat down to discuss the discontent the young pastor was experiencing after over a decade of leading the church he started. “I can’t really pinpoint what it is that I am feeling,” Steven said. “Don’t get me wrong. I love our church and I’m not looking to move on. But I am just so weary of the weight and pace of carrying this thing. Something seems off.” Over the next couple of hours Lance asked Steven to give an overview of how day-to-day workflow and responsibilities were carried out—the way the church was governed, and the methods accountability and authority was practiced among the staff. Next he had Steven draw the church’s organizational structure with the names and titles of those involved. The result was a classic pyramid leadership chart. At one-point Lance spun the sketch 180 degrees. “All that weight is on the point, Steven. You’re the point. And you are the point because so much points toward you. That’s a lot of weight on your shoulders,” Lance said, before steering the conversation to a prophetic promise of the coming messiah: For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Isaiah 9:6. (ESV) Steven pushed back from the table and sighed deeply, “Wow, that sounds so refreshing and hopeful.” Like that worn out young pastor, just imagine the momentous value this familiar verse can bring if we stop limiting it to glittery Christmas cards and cantatas but allow it to shape and inform our leadership approach. It is a promise! First off, the weight of governing rests on the triune Godhead of the Holy Spirit (counselor), Father, and Son (Prince of Peace). The weight of leadership rests there. And our leadership role opens up to God’s counsel, might, and peace. The government shall be upon his shoulder. There are two ways you can live. One, you live like Atlas and exhaust your soul. Remember the old myth of Atlas? What did he carry on his shoulders? The weight of the world. As you read this, to what degree to you feel that weight on your shoulders? There is another way to live. Jesus describes the second option, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” Matthew 11:28-30 How good does that sound? That’s what we need! The way of the Light Load Leader. When Jesus says, “Take my yoke,” he’s saying, “Let me train you, so your soul is light as a feather, fluid as water, deep as the ocean, and strong as mighty oak.” Way too many leaders believe that the weight of the world is to be upon their shoulders. For example, hear what Seattle pastor Eugene Cho shared with the congregation he led for 18 years during his announcement of resignation: “I’ve not been able to honor my responsibilities as Lead Pastor. As a result, some of that burden has trickled down to some of the other pastors, which simply isn’t fair to them, our staff, or frankly, the church. The church needs a lead pastor that can be fully invested and drive the vision and mission of the church.” We are not called to be Atlas. So how might we ensure that the leadership (government) of our organizations rest upon His shoulder? Macro-management over Micro-management First, picture a system of macro-management whereby the responsibility of self-managing is distributed to every individual rather than a micro-management system of superiors in pockets of the organization. Some wonderful pointers are hidden in plain sight within the Bible. In his letter to the church at Philippi the apostle Paul speaks of his companions as fellow workers. The word is also translated as “yokefellow” This is a term that expresses collegiality, camaraderie, and partnership. Yokefellow harkens to the tool used to join two oxen in unison. A yoke was a simple mechanism made from a pole with two side-byside U-shaped devices that fit over the necks of the oxen. The word in Greek means, “to pull together in harness.” To call someone your yokefellow is to say, “We are in this thing together, shoulder to shoulder. We may have differing strengths, but we are both just a couple of oxen whose reins are in the hands of the same Master.” Jesus says, “Take my yoke upon you...” Paul uses the language that helps us take Jesus’ yoke. The promise is: “You will find rest for your souls.” Four Signs of Micromanagement Delegation doesn’t happen. Micromanagers can’t believe others can do the job, so they do it themselves. Over-reporting is required. Everyone must make periodic reports. Micromanagers make it seem like reporting is the job. No power to make decisions. Team members feel like the smallest task may require a sign off. The hoarding of skills and knowledge. Micromanagers see knowledge and skill as their currency, so sharing it means they feel they will lose value.1 When we view church and faith-based organizations as a typical business, we end up viewing those who should be our yokefellows and peers as employees and subordinates. As we will show later, this is not to say that everyone has the same role or ability. Different giftings and talents equip us all for different roles. What causes us to go off the rails—through the sin of lording over others—is the tendency to rank the rarer gifts and talents of a few servants above the more common gifts and talents held by others. We will touch on how this plays out in Starfish leadership later in the book. We are not claiming that starfish leadership is completely stress-free, but we are confident it sets us free from many of the stresses and burdens currently associated with leadership, as we’ve known it. By its very design modern leadership particularly has factors that make it hard in ways it doesn’t have to be. If you have ever watched a spider build a web it looks like a pretty hard, complex, and lonely endeavor, something that is often said about leadership. Though bullies and jerks certainly exist, and we have had our own share of experiences with them, this book isn’t about focusing on the villains and tyrants. Like Steven, the vast majority of leaders in faith-based organizations we have encountered, even when they are leading in spider practices, are good and sincere people who are just doing the best they can with what they know. Equipping over Directing Take a few minutes to think through the things that stress you out as a leader or one who is or has been under leadership. What is the root source of most of the stress? Where does the pressure come from? For most leaders, stress comes from the pressure to produce results. We call it “the bottom line” or “the main thing.” First off, we must make sure we know what our main thing is. We must make sure we have kept to the main thing. In doing so it is vital for us to use only the tools and methods that correspond with what we are seeking to produce. Blowtorches and sledgehammers are not seen in gardens. The Pathway Toward MacroManagement and Equipping Delegation is an art. Jesus walked with his disciples incrementally. Delegation is a leadership development process, not a product. The goal is to replace yourself and to develop others to their maximum influence, while maintaining clarity and increasing authority along the way. Level 1: Do exactly what I have asked you to do. Don’t deviate from my instructions. I have already researched the options and determined what I want you to do. Level 2: Research the topic and report back. We will discuss it, and then I will make the decision and tell you what I want you to do. Level 3: Research the topic, outline the options, and make a recommendation. Give me the pros and cons of each option but tell me what you think we should do. If I agree with your decision, I will authorize you to move forward. Level 4: Make a decision and then tell me what you did. I trust you to do the research, make the best decision you can, and then keep me in the loop. I don’t want to be surprised by someone else. Level 5: Make whatever decision you think is best. No need to report back. I trust you completely. I know you will follow through. You have my full support.1 The Art of Delegation by Gavin Adams A seminal mistake of man-made leadership systems is the creation of organizational cultures whereby leaders excessively rely upon the power of: Titles and rank (under the guise of “authority”) Human charisma and personality (under the guise of “alpha leader”) Human stamina (under the guise of “work ethic”) Human technique (under the guise of “ingenuity”) So, we must ask ourselves if our primary leadership stress comes from the task or challenges of the initiatives themselves or if it is related to one or more of the bullet points above. Being a spider leader or caught in the web of a spider leader who operates from these powers alone creates a weighty burden that is unsustainable over time. It shuts down the spirit in the majority of our coworkers and leaves little room for the Spirit of God to guide and speak to us, and to do the heavy lifting necessary to bring about the wins we are looking for. The end game too often is crash and burn stories whereby leaders flame out through narcissistically driven habits. The organization ultimately can’t take it anymore and confronts the leader directly or credible accusations eventually surface to force the leader into stepping down or being removed. Other scenarios play out with a leader that burns out or succumbs to addictions of one sort or another. Besides being way less productive, this leaderosis drives us in unnecessary, unhealthy, and less lifegiving ways for everyone. It is soul crushing, requiring an enormous effort to keep the leader persona propped up. If you have watched the classic movie The Wizard of Oz, you will remember near the end of the film that Dorothy’s little dog Toto pulls the green curtain back on the “powerful” Wizard. Come to find out he is he is just a little man with a big microphone who operates pulleys and levers. In the end he is powerless and harmless. All along he has reduced himself into playing a cheapened role that falls way short of who he was made to be. As the scene unfolds the Wizard is at first startled to be exposed but quickly is clearly relieved to get out from behind the curtain. And then something incredible takes place. He becomes who he was meant to be all along. Leaving behind command and control the Wizard transforms into an equipper and encourager, a phenomenal leader! A new authentic confidence and strength emerges. The former Wizard helps the Scarecrow see his own untapped potential and get the brain he has longed for. He transforms the cowardly lion into a full-fledged member of the Legion of Courage and helps the Tin Man understand the importance of love and what makes a heart what it is meant to be. Leaving behind the role of commander and controller the little man steps into the joy of being himself and starts changing lives for the better! Partnering over Paternalism Much of what keeps us as leaders from experiencing the easy yoke and light burden Jesus offered can be traced to a basic but misguided assumption that organizations are machines and most people lack the necessary self-discipline and acumen to carry out their tasks. It creates Wizard roles whereby otherwise gifted and good-hearted equippers and mentors are reduced to lever pulling controllers with volume-enhanced voices. This mode of organizational management was designed within and for the industrial age. It came from the need for prediction and precision through engineering and architecture, delivering products forged from cold hard steel. Assembly line workers were measured with clocks and quotas. They were constantly hovered over by the lingering eye of the shift boss in an open windowed upper office on the factory floor. The conflict is that our faith communities are not factories. They are more so gardens. They are not full of robots. They are families. Margaret Wheatley writes, “The tension of our times is that we want our organizations to behave as living systems, but we only know how to treat them as machines. It is time to change the way we think about organizations. Organizations are living systems. All living systems have the capacity to selforganize, to sustain themselves and move toward greater complexity and order as needed.”34 We have discovered a vast number of organizations, both for profit and non-profit, that have grown phenomenally successful endeavors by structuring themselves in non-hierarchical ways. Companies such as Morning Star, founded in 1970, which dominates the tomato processing and transport space in the United States. If you have indulged in pizza, spaghetti, or just about any other meal with a tomato paste ingredient it is almost certain you have tasted their product. This is a company that operates sans human bosses and hierarchy. It is organized through shared principles and self-management and held together by its “principles, mission, processes and a culture of learning and coaching.”35 Or consider Resources for Human Development, an almost 50-year-old Philadelphia-based non-profit with over 4,500 staff members focusing on a series of needs such as homelessness, addiction recovery, and mental disabilities. They provide over $200 million to tens of thousands of people across 14 states. RHD is built on a system of self-management and a safe and open environment where information is shared freely, early, and often. If non-faith-based organizations can operate in such ways it is more than reasonable to imagine churches and other faith organizations can function likewise. Particularly for those in North America, the American work ethic has played a major role in shaping leadership ideology. Many faith organizations have unwittingly imported the HR manuals of corporate America straight into their day-to-day workforce policy. We have let systems that make no claim whatsoever of being informed by the Word and Spirit of God to set the rules for us. Earthy thinking never creates heavenly results. Most of the earthy leadership thinking of our day creates paternalistic cultures. Take this typical example from a member on staff at a large southern church. Dan was an exceptionally competent and productive leader of an entire sector of the church. He asked to take a day off to take his college freshman son to move into his new dorm. Dan was told he would have to use one of his vacation days in order to take the day off. It was all referred to policy. But no one stopped and asked, “Why do we have such policies?” “Where did we get this policy?” First off, the time Dan spent for the church was
