---far beyond a 40-hour workweek. Anyone who has served on a church staff knows that work does not stay at the office once you leave for home. Yet, this capable adult was required to ask permission from the Executive Pastor for a “day off.” Second, like a child going to a parent Dan was required to get permission for something the one he was asking permission of would not have had to ask permission of anyone to do the same thing. The EP and Senior Pastor were the only ones allowed to set their own schedule, typical habits in most churches. The unspoken dynamic in such scenarios is that only two adults in the entire organization have the competency, credibility, and trustworthiness to make selfmanaged decisions. Let that sink in. Perks and privileges for a select few at the top should always be a tell-tale sign that servant leadership is not functioning. Servants never get perks and privileges that those they are serving don’t get. Paternalism is a classic trait of modern leadership. It treats adults as children and is demeaning, demoralizing, and unnecessary in a healthy spirit led organization. Spiritual over Industrial Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom The “light and easy” proposition offered to our souls—our minds, will, and emotions—is out of reach when we have grown accustomed to operating from the power of human will and unrefined soulish strength, rather than the fuel of God’s Spirit. For leaders who have never heard of such operating structures this Starfish talk may sound not only impossible but also outrageous. The brilliance is in the processes and systems by which such organizations function. At the heart of this genius is a strident belief and trust in the capacity within people and the value placed on human relationships that consequently incorporate certain ground rules that support healthy and prolific teamwork. Morning Star’s Doug Kirkpatrick writes, “To the degree that our people are free to perform to the best of their ability, they are also free to innovate change that improves performance even more. There will be no barriers to communication in the workplace—anyone will be able to discuss anything with anyone else regardless of area or process.”36 Trust is as important as anything for those who hope to perpetuate movemental endeavors. Leaders who trust their teams show the greatest trust in God, because God is in the people that make up those teams. Developing cultures of freedom is the proof of trust and belief in the Spirit of God to do his work through his people. Any team member should be able to talk to anyone about anything relating to the organization and its endeavors. It should be easy for us to see that freedom in our job places is the most natural and efficient way for us to operate. It is the way people actually live their lives at home and every place else. The use of force and person-to-person unilateral authority is the most commonly used modus operandi of industrial aged leadership. Exercising rank, intimidation, or leveraging sheer personality power comes not from the Spirit of God but from the lower primal parts of creature behavioral dominance. Remember, management was originally developed in order to depersonalize work so that employees could be easily stationed, evaluated and replaced when deemed obsolete. It was and is a form of dehumanization. Anyone who has been unceremoniously fired or harshly talked down to can attest to feeling depersonalized. This is why the Industrial Revolution instituted hierarchy in the first place, where leaders were given heavy-handed power over others. Relationships and human feeling and emotions were considered as needless distractions. Who ever heard an ironworker asking a furnace how life was going or a mechanic asking an engine if it had any thoughts on how to produce more horsepower? People began to be treated as if they were cogs, parts, and machines. They were expected to do their appointed job, nothing more, nothing less. Leave it to the architects and engineers to figure out improvements and better ways. There is a far better way. And certainly, there is a Godlier way, that is also very much life giving. In his book Alive at Work, Daniel Cable discusses the neuroscience behind what motivates or disengages people. He says, “Many organizations are deactivating the part of employees’ brains called the seeking system. Our seeking systems create the natural impulse to explore our worlds, learn about our environments, and extract meaning from our circumstances. When we follow the urges of our seeking system, it releases dopamine—a neurotransmitter linked to motivation and pleasure—that makes us want to explore more.”37 Most organizations today have cultures that simply do not foster experimentation and creativity that reaches beyond predetermined job descriptions and preset decision-making boundaries. It should be simple to see that this grossly limits people’s untapped skills and insight—a vast resource of problem solving and potential of creative advancement. Amazingly enough each and every day we all utilize technology that was created and continues to develop at astonishing rates—by companies such as Google or Apple, which have flexible work cultures that encourage freedom and creativity. Innovation of world changing levels most often arises in such cultures. Coaching over Bossing Moving from hierarchical to humble leadership changes the role of a leader from boss and manager to coach and mentor. The leader’s goal is to help her teammates discover and develop their fullest potential. By choosing to relinquish the Wizard role we cease wearing ourselves down in the feverish pace of command and control. Instead, we work to unleash the brainpower, heart passion, and courageous fortitude of our team members. This scenario requires attitudes of equality from everyone on the team. Apart from such postures honest and transparent communication will never thrive. People will only tell those above them what they think they want to hear and those below them what they think they need to know. It leaves no chance for genuine relationships and familial community to flourish. Seven Coaching Questions That Will Change the Way You Lead Forever Our leaders/coaches in the KC Underground use the following seven questions to develop our leaders. These are from The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More, & Change the Way You Lead Forever by Michael Bungay Stanier. The Kick Start Question: What's on your mind? The A.W.E. Question: And what else? The Focus Question: What's the real challenge here for you? The Foundation Question: What do you want? The Lazy Question: How can I help? The Strategic Question: If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to? The Learning Question: What was most useful for you? Transforming our perspective of one another to that of yokefellows produces a peer-based culture rather than a traditional leadership culture. We no longer categorize people as leaders and subordinates. There is no elevating or superstaring of leadership because there is no thought of or leveraging of rank. Leadership emerges as a natural byproduct that materializes organically and exceptionally. Wheatley fittingly says, “In nature, change never happens as a result of top-down, preconceived strategic plans or from the mandate of any single individual or boss. Change begins as local actions spring up simultaneously around the system.” When we allow our organizations to be ruled on the Spirit’s shoulders governance happens regularly, distributed throughout the organization. No longer does it rest upon one single leader but becomes a key process. It changes the way we function in leadership by changing the way we view our roles. Distributed leadership means that “functions that traditionally reside with a CEO or executive team (move) into processes that are enacted throughout the organization, with everyone’s participation.”39 Clear processes are essential for the type of leadership system we are speaking of to work. Moving forward in the book we will deal with principles and practices that answer questions such as: Who can make decisions and what are the limits on those decisions? How is accountability held in place? What actions can individuals make without keeping the organization bogged down in meetings? What agreements should we come to in order to honor the spirit of being yokefellows? Transitioning toward Starfish and Spirit leadership brings us to a place of trusting the Spirit of God to build his people and lead his organizations via the people that are the organization. The gifts and fruit of the Spirit are unleashed to flow freely throughout the group, unfettered and unlimited by a small elevated few. Chapter 5 Thinking Outside the Pyramid The modern organization cannot be an organization of boss and subordinate. –Peter Drucker Movements, by definition, cannot be led, and they cannot be planned really. They defy control and singular identity. A movement is a leaderless enterprise. –Brian Sanders Have you ever tried to roll a triangle? Cavemen figured out a long time ago that circles make much better wheels than pyramids do. This simile is a clue for movement thinking. If we hope for our organizations to proliferate as dynamic movements then we must seek to discover movemental types of leadership systems. The first challenge for most of us will be to think beyond the triangles of the most commonly used organization charts. Whether you are a senior leader or staff member with leadership oversight in particular areas of your organization, when seeking to uncork the latent talent available, you must be willing to consider an entirely different function from a traditional CEO, senior, or junior executive. To reimagine leadership in the structure of the starfish kind we certainly face challenges, but we can also crack the safe of greater inspiration as we consider the transformational possibilities. The challenges are in abandoning the old ways of thinking while resisting our own knee jerk reactions back to what we have always known. Peter Block says, “The concept of leadership does not leave much room for the concept of partnership. We need a way to hold on to the initiative and accountability and vision of the leadership idea, and to abandon the inevitable baggage of dominance and selfcenteredness.”40 Circle-Celled Every living thing is made up of cells and the starfish is of course no exception. Think of the cells of a starfish as circles. Within the starfish leadership structure the circle is, in the words of Baldwin and Linnea, “...essentially a gathering of equals, people who set aside external, hierarchical positions that categorize and separate them and sit down in a ring of chairs with a clearly defined intention or purpose symbolically represented in the middle.”41 The Godhead is a circle! The old-world image of God is that of a singular monarch, seated on a throne: a pyramid. The Latin word for God is Deus, not a far cry from Zeus, a primitive image of God that still occupies the imaginations of millions. Your image of God influences your entire life. You become like the God you worship. That’s why we have so much Zeus-like leadership. Yet, how radically did Jesus deconstruct this pyramid? God comes as a vulnerable baby born among an oppressed people in a land occupied by Zeus-worshippers. He lived as simple man of trade, then kicked started his ministry by creating a leadership circle of fisherman and tax-collectors. Gradually, he reveals the Circle at the Center: Father, Son, and Spirit. Of course, it took the church centuries to develop the doctrine of the Trinity until finally the Cappadocian Fathers used a word from Greek theater to describe it, paerichoresis, which literally means circle dance. God is a relationship or dance of equality and interdependence. We are invited into that the circle. How could we not model all of our leadership on this theological foundation? 42 We need circles of equality and interdependence that are open, inviting others in. That is the way of Jesus. The circle changes the leader’s role to that of a facilitator and coach who generates some, but by no means all, of the ideas while allowing those in his or her circle to not only follow through on concepts, but to add to and adapt them. The result is not a leaderless church or organization. Far from it, the upshot is more and better leadership. For a Starfish culture to thrive leaders must reimagine their roles and practices. Several years ago, I (Lance) was part of a pastoral team that experimented with a form of shared leadership. Up to this point the church was led in the typical Senior Pastor/Associate Pastors structure. I (Lance) was one of the two associate pastors. The Senior Pastor was a true shepherd and teacher. He was altogether selfless and sharing. The three of us had diverse gift mixes and therefore complimented one another tremendously, filling the other’s shortcomings in both viewpoint and talent. Our pulpit voices brought a healthy variety of insight and perspective to the discipling of the members and the church exploded in growth. It was brimming in creativity, development, and an overall lifechanging message. But it all came to a sudden end when the Lead guy finally could not take not receiving primary credit for the wonderful things that were happening in our midst. He felt a sense of diminishing value and initiated a devastating blow up that split the church. Over two decades later he has repeatedly confessed his lack of maturity at the time along with a deep regret for causing the end to what was a great work of the Spirit up to that point. Thankfully we have had a healthy restored relationship for many years now. Though this pastor had his share of blame in the botched leadership experiment it was not altogether his fault. Looking back on the situation, we had failed to develop ground rules and necessary structures and systems vital to operating a shared leadership ethos. This omission served to create opportunities for poor communication and a lack of healthy sharing of information. Previously each of us had experience only in pyramid leadership structure, which runs on a diminished degree of relational IQ. It lacks the holistic components that make a living body function. There was no systemic mutual understanding or practical habits to support our desire for shared leadership. Each of us had teams and programs we led. But without ground rules and processes in place we were, in essence, each doing our own thing. The cumulative effect bred inadvertent competition, insecurity, and a feeling of disorientation. We plainly lacked the necessary systems of navigation for the uncharted waters before us. Even a few simple practices would have helped tremendously. Understanding the power of circles would have been the perfect starting place. Taking nothing for granted, Peter Block is a stickler for circling up. He even believes the way we arrange meeting spaces weigh heavily on the way groups relate to one another and one of the most helpful ways to convene collegiality and do away with prestige and control is to rearrange the room. Block’s motto is “Change the room, change the culture.”— The task is to rearrange the room to meet our intention to build relatedness, accountability, and commitment. The room needs to express the quality of aliveness and belonging that we wish for the community. The circle is the geometric symbol for community, and therefore for arranging the room. No tables if possible. If tables are a given, then choose round ones (the shape of communion), which are better than rectangles (the shape of negotiation), or classroom-style tables (the shape of instruction). The ideal seating for a small group is a circle of chairs with no table. Put the chairs as close together as possible, which forces people to lean into one another.43 The wisdom here is that it fleshes out and actualizes the symbols we say characterize us. For instance, Janette has served as Senior Rabbi for over seven years of a sizeable congregation on the East Coast. Throughout the past year or so she has worked with her staff to shift into a peer led, circle leadership culture. Janette has worked diligently to shape the culture of the team by not only encouraging others to share their thoughts, ideas, and creativity on a daily basis, but she is careful to use inclusive language throughout her interactions. In planning meetings Janette and the team arrange the room in a circle and she views a shift of her role from being decider and enabler to discerner and equipper. Assessing the Circle Catalytic leaders understand the gifts, passions and stories of their circle-members. This awareness increases the possibility of a meaningful interdependent dance, where we move together, leveraging each person’s strengths and buttressing each other’s weaknesses. Without assessment, the dance diminishes, as we step on each other’s toes. Consider the following assessment tools. These are the assessment tools we use in the KC Underground. GPS: Gifts, Passions, Story. (giftspassionstory.com) DISC Profile (discprofile.com) Strengthfinders (gallup.com/cliftonstrengths) Five Voices (5voices.com) Enneagram (enneagraminstitute.com) APEST (fivefoldsurvey.com) Janette seeks to draw out of each team member the voice the Spirit has given him or her to speak to the overall leadership community, without limits. She has utilized multiple types of gifts assessments as she sought to bring team wide understanding of one another across the organization. Janette senses a key part of her role for the organization is to help every team member have the opportunity to present his or her best insight, talent, and desires to the overall mission. Her thoughts constantly lean toward ways to crack open the latent insights the Spirit has imparted into each person. Frequently, prior to a meeting, Janette asks another team member to serve as catalyst for the gathering. She is content to meld into the circle with no greater status than any other participant. This rabbi cedes the leadership to the Spirit’s movement through all within the circle. It has become increasingly common during strategic meetings for a key idea or perspective to come forth through a team member that a couple of years prior would have not felt free or encouraged to share his viewpoint based on his role, rank, or fear of status loss. Think of yourselves the way Christ Jesus thought of himself. He had equal status with God but didn’t think so much of himself that he had to cling to the advantages of that status no matter what. Not at all. When the time came, he set aside the privileges of deity and took on the status of a slave, became human! Having become human, he stayed human. It was an incredibly humbling process. He didn't claim special privileges. Instead, he lived a selfless, obedient life and then died a selfless, obedient death--and the worst kind of death at that--a crucifixion. Phil. 2:5-7 The Message Catalyst-Sparked Shifting to shared leadership compels leaders who have been accustomed to being in charge to let go of insecurities that nurture their self-worth based upon the importance they have to the group or organization. Their identity must go deeper than what they mean to the group as a leader. For faith leaders we must incarnate the motto of John the Baptist: “He must become greater; I must become less”44 in order to trust God to rule supreme and move through who He chooses in the moment. The ego trap of leader-identity breeds demands for respect and flawed definitions of success. It is an ever-present pitfall that must be backfilled with a soul settling resolve that finds contentment and value simply as a treasured child of God, apart from status and titles. Leaders in this mode find joy in seeing the gifts and talents of others bloom and flourish. This paradigm sets our teams free to work from our true calling as servants for all of God’s children. Fredrick Laloux in his brilliant book Reinventing Organizations shares: The pursuit of love, recognition, and success shapes our lives slowly but surely to the point that we end up, in the words of poet May Sarton, “Wearing other people’s faces.” Our journey toward inner rightness prompts some soul searching of who we are and what our purpose in life might be. The ultimate goal in life is not to be successful or loved, but to become the truest expression of ourselves, to live into authentic selfhood, to honor our birthright gifts and callings, and be of service to humanity and our world.45 The Starfish goal is not to give everyone the exact same volume of power. The quest is to make everyone as powerful as possible. This means we let go of the over wrought identity of leader and embrace the roll of a catalyst. The catalyst shapes culture and DNA but is happy to cede control in the moment to the members of the team. In letting go of the headship role, the catalyst transfers deep, shared ownership and responsibility to the circle under the leadership of the Spirit of God. The results are freedom for creativity, greater buy-in, lasting stability, mutual respect, and deeper community meaning. Developing a culture of mutuality requires practical steps of addressing status language that undermines the ethos of collegiality. Jesus gave unambiguous instructions about his feelings and commands regarding leadership in his tribe in regard to titles. Yet what he demands in the following is patently ignored in almost every church and religious entity. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. Matthew 23:6-12 Jesus says we are siblings. Churches are not businesses or corporations. They are family. His point? Stop elevating yourselves over one another. If you want to go up do so by going down. Humble yourself and let God do the exalting. He flattened the hierarchical ideals. Jesus didn’t say if you want to become great become a leader. He said, “If you want to be great, become a servant.” He was emphatic. He forbade rank-based titles, permitting no place for them. Why so, we may wonder. First off, titles are meant to identify but too often they are dividers. They highlight status, for better or worse. Titles too often position one person or group over the other and create boundaries, fences, and doors that need permission or privilege for entry. Titles change the entire dynamic of a relationship, creating a new set of rules and limits of expression, openness, and authenticity. As soon as a title is applied to one person, the title “less than or greater than” is pinned to the other. Titles create psychological and sociological dynamics of hierarchy.46 Holding on to rank-based titles undermine collegiality. Leadership and Power Making the titular shift from senior leader to co-worker is not a negative change in status, unless the leader feels the need to leverage her title or seniority. The Starfish effect is not a demotion of any one leader. It is a promotion for everyone! It unleashes the servantship spirit throughout the organization. This is a shift in the perception of the way we view leadership power. It changes our view of how it best works and how the Spirit of God works it in us and throughout our groups and organizations. A commitment on this point means leaders become better people. They become humble, spirit-led humans as opposed to dominating personalities. It provides no quarter for bullies or tyrants. Developing synagogues, churches, or any type organization in the Starfish mode takes patience on everyone’s part. You may have heard the famous Druckerism—“culture eats strategy for breakfast.” A Starfish strategy is not enough. Success or failure depends on the hard work of creating a new culture. The challenge is to develop modes of leadership that maintain accountability and vision while dispatching with dominance and ego-driven self-centered command and control. For organizations seeking to shift to Starfish leadership the temptation is to throw in the towel when emotions run raw, concluding the industrial way was easier. We are the first to admit that hierarchical leadership is indeed easier in the beginning. But easier is seldom better. Early on in the quest to reinvent his fledgling construction company, Sid—an experienced owner of past businesses worth millions—took up my (Lance) challenge to build something different, to start doing business as unusual. The first time I discussed the concepts we are looking at in this book with him Sid responded as if I had told him I believed in the Tooth Fairy. Unbeknownst to me he read one of the books I suggested and a few weeks later came to me and said, “Okay, I believe this is right. Now, how do we do it?” Over the next several months Sid began to develop a company that has become profitable as well as filled with highly content coworkers, many of whom are utilizing elements of wisdom and creativity that they were never permitted to exercise in previous work environments. Looking back at the experiment and its current yield Sid says the biggest fear he had in a Starfish leadership shift was, “Trusting others when the stuff hit the fan. In my past company I would just micro-manage and I knew everything would float. But as soon as I took that pressure off people it all caved in. The early days of implementing a flattened leadership structure were met with some real bumps in the road and I was really tempted to throw in the towel and just revert back to command and control. I’m so glad I didn’t.” Sid’s biggest surprise of the experiment has been “discovering the indomitable spirit within people when they are trusted and permitted to bring their entire selves to the workplace. I now have an entire team of creative people that show up every day believing we are going to do something great together.” In The Starfish and The Spider Ori Brafman stressed the differences in CEO type leadership— A CEO is The Boss. He’s in charge, and he occupies the top of the hierarchy. A catalyst interacts with people as a peer. He comes across as your friend. Because CEOs must be rational; their job is to create shareholder value. Catalysts depend on emotional intelligence; their job is to create personal relationships.47 To attain this, it is crucial that the organizational culture abound in both spirit and practice of shared leading. In letting go of the leadership role, the catalyst transfers ownership and responsibility to the circle.48 At the same time while attempting to develop Starfish cultures it is extremely important that we not abandon agreed upon rules and well thought systems. Jettisoning policies and guidelines altogether are both unwise and impractical. It sets the stage for abuse and emotional driven collapses. Servantship and a Starfish culture will not simply evolve in a vacuum of hierarchy. Starfish thinking “does not mean that we are all interchangeable, or that we are all the same—with equal talents, experience, needs, ambitions, and so forth—or that we even make equal contributions. But what it does assert is that all members of the organization have equal standing.”49 This paradigm is rooted in the belief that the answers to our problems or opportunities is not relegated to top tier leadership but can be found at any place within the circle. The answers emerge because of the culture that both supports and encourages mutual respect and ideation throughout the organization. Ori wrote about the role of leader as catalyst: “In chemistry, a catalyst is any element or compound that initiates a reaction without fusing into that reaction. In open organizations, a catalyst is the person who initiates a circle and then fades away into the background.”50 The catalyst trusts that those in her circle have the knowledge, skill, and ability to bring the best answers to existing problems and opportunities. Collaboratively Co-Laboring Let’s do a bit of word study. First, consider the word collaboration. This word means to work with others on a shared goal. There is much to discover when we ruminate on the power in this term. The first thing we should notice is the root is co-labor. Notice that no hierarchy is present. The prefix co means mutual and in common, therefore equality is assumed and by definition, is emphasized. This word is used 13 times in the Christian New Testament, translated in multiple forms: fellow laborer, helper, fellow worker, fellow helper, workfellow, companion, etc. The Greek transliteration is synergos. This is where we get the English word synergy. Co-laboring produces synergy! Synergy is the experience or effect that takes place when the combined interactions of people create more wisdom, ideation, and fruit than the sum of the individuals in solo mode. As Ori has said previously, “In letting go of the leadership role, the catalyst transfers ownership and responsibility to the circle.”51 This makes way for the catalyzing of synergy. Co-laboring is about being a peer-based organization. The etymology of the word peer is fascinating. To peer means to squint at, to look intently in order to bring into focus. The word also means to consider as an equal. Bosses are not peers because they do not allow others to really see them, to really know them. This mindset goes hand in hand with not considering certain members of the team to be their equals. Time and again both Rob and I have heard Senior Pastors advise young pastors to keep a distance between themselves and their staff. The ideology is that if you become friends with your staff you will lose authority over them. The myth surrounding such leaders is that they do not possess real authority in the first place. They brandish power via fear and intimidation. Such advise clearly thumbs its nose at Jesus and his model of relationship with his twelve disciples No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. —Jesus52 The principle of circle over pyramid yields limitless metaphors. One that we have found useful is that of a fire pit with the group circled around it. A good fire is necessary for warmth, illumination, and food. Collaboration means every member of the team is around the fire in view of one another. The fire represents the organization (church, company, guild, etc.) including its vision, values, initiatives, history, and present opportunities and risks. The flames will only keep going if fuel is continually added as needed. Each member seated around it brings in the wood for the fire. The wood is each member’s story, experience, skills, ideas, wisdom, and opinion. Anyone is free to place wood on the fire— kindling, chunks, and chips, whatever they have. When routine updates and decisions are needed “let’s gather around the fire” is a great metaphor for any team. We are not advocating for the total dispelling of hierarchy. What we are encouraging is a naturally organizing, fresh hierarchy that is not a cold steel framed ladder. It is a living system that replaces systems that subordinate the majority of the organization to a select few with “a hierarchy of processes, projects, and assignments.”53 In the absence of hierarchy of “bosses over subordinates, space becomes available for other natural and spontaneous hierarchies to spring up.”54 The new hierarchy constantly renews itself and manifests spontaneously and without fanfare, built on “recognition, influence, and skill (sometimes referred to as ‘actualization hierarchies’ in place of traditional ‘dominator hierarchies’).”55 Wheatley writes, Entering into a world of shared significance is only achieved by engaging in conversations with colleagues. Not debates or oratories, but conversation that welcomes in the unique perspective of everyone there. If we remain curious about what someone else sees and refrain from convincing them of our interpretation, we develop a richer view of what might be going on. And we also create collegial relations that enable us to work together with greater speed and effectiveness. When any of us feel invited to share our perspective, we repay that respect and trust with commitment and friendship.56 Collaboration through Organic Hierarchy does not lessen responsibility and accountability. To the contrary, it expands both by placing them on everyone within the organization. No longer is a worker responsible and accountable to one higher up supervisor or manager. He is now responsible and accountable to his fellow workers. In the fall of 2018 our (Lance) farming neighborhood near Panama City, Florida was among those hit head on with Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 storm that was the third most intense hurricane to ever strike the United States. The devastation was incomprehensible. Every major highway and country road in the county became little more than forest trails as over 2.5 million pine and other trees came crashing down. The most needed commodities in the days following the storm were water, chain saws, generators, and fuel. These supplies could only be found well outside the counties hit by the storm. Two days after the storm I was awakened by a voice whispering through my bedroom screen window. “Hey Lance. We’re driving to Dothan, AL for supplies. You wanna’ go?” Markus, my neighbor had procured an enclosed twenty-foot cargo trailer and was rounding up neighbors to make the trip. That evening we returned with pallets of water, dozens of filled gas containers, generators, and chainsaws. The neighbors self-organized, acquired supplies, and cleared our road. If competent people can self-manage and organize their day-to-day life the question presents itself as to why these same people would lose that high level of expertise and ability when they show up for work. Speaking on organizational intelligence, biologist Francisco Varela says “ It isn’t the ability to solve problems that makes an organization smart. It is the ability of its members to enter into a world whose significance they share. Everyone in the group has to feel that what is occurring is significant—even as they have different perspectives.57 Coaching & Mentoring Guided Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed. Proverbs 15:22 Jesus was the greatest leader ever and he modeled servanthood at its best. We should be asking why our best books on leadership are not filled with the way he formed his team and led them! It is the fuel of humility that drives leaders who identify themselves not as bosses but servants. They have found great joy and strength in helping those around them discover and experiment with their own potential. It makes for the best type of leader because it causes people to want to be around such catalysts. Mentoring is as old as civilization itself. Through this natural relational process, experience and values pass from one generation to another. Mentoring took place among Old Testament prophets (Eli and Samuel, Elijah and Elisha) and leaders (Moses and Joshua), and New Testament leaders (Barnabas and Paul, Paul and Timothy). Throughout human history, mentoring was the primary means of passing on knowledge and skills in every field—from Greek philosophers to sailors—and in every culture. But in the modern age, the learning shifted. It now relies primarily on computers, classrooms, books and videos. Thus, today the relational connection between the knowledge-and-experience giver and the receiver has weakened or is nonexistent.58 Elder Coaching and Mentoring Dispatching traditional management and rank based titles as we develop a peer-based organization requires managers reinvent their roles into those of coaches and mentors. This aspect is vital for implementing self-management. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim cultures all recognize the value of receiving the wise council of elders. In peer-based circle leadership organizations rank-based executive leadership gives way to relational-based elder leadership. The pressure of rank disappears as the advisory function emerges releasing wisdom, knowledge, and experienced based understanding. The primary reason why our ideas on church leadership have strayed so far from Jesus’ example, can be traced to our tendency to project Western notions of government and business onto our faith communities. When we read words like “pastor,” “overseer,” and “elder,” we immediately think in terms of governmental offices like “president” or business offices like “CEO.” At that point, we regard elders, pastors, and overseers as sociological constructs (offices). We view them as vacant slots that possess a reality independent of the persons who populate them, which they don’t. On this Frank Voila notes, “Such biases have transformed simple words into heavily loaded ecclesiastical titles. As a result, they have eroded the original landscape of the church. Thus, a fresh reading of the N.T. in its original language is necessary for properly understanding certain texts. For instance, a look at the original Greek yields the following insights: “Overseers/Bishops” are simply guardians (episkopoi), not High-Church officials. “Pastors” are caretakers (poimen), not professional preachers. “Deacons” are servants (diakonos), not clergy. “Elders” are wise individuals (presbuteros), not bosses on the board.” 59 Three different terms are used in the New Testament to refer to the same church leaders: “POIMEN” translated as “shepherds” or “pastors.” “PRESBUTEROS” translated as “elders.” “EPISCOPOS” translated as “overseers” or rarely, “bishops” Elders are… Guardians (episkopoi) protecting and defending the flock, not High-Church officers who leverage their position for their personal advancement. (1 Peter 5:1-4, James 5:13-15) Caretakers (poimen) who serve with the spirit of one who is “among” the flock, not “over” the flock (Acts 20:35). Wise Guides (presbuteros) who know God’s word and how to apply it with discernment, orthodoxy and specificity, not professional preachers. (1 Timothy 5:17; 3:2, Titus 1:9; Acts 20:27, 32, Hebrews 13:7, 17, 24) Influencers in that by virtue of their wisdom and spiritual maturity, they are accorded respect. Their godly character, spiritual stature, and sacrificial service to the people of God gives them increased influence. They have an ability to help those who are immature, off track or confused to reorient their lives under Jesus’ Lordship and the authority of the Scripture because of their persuasive power to convince and to win over rather than to coerce, force, or browbeat others into submission. Appointed People who are not “elected,” but recognized. The term in the New Testament is that of the “laying on of hands,” by an established elder-level leader (Acts 14:23; 1 Timothy5:22; Titus 1:5). This was a recognition of the “elder-life” they had already been living. The Spirit was active, helping current elders recognize the emerging elders and overseers (Acts 20:28). But this divine guidance does not short circuit a very frank assessment of a person’s character ( 1 Timothy 3:2-7 and Titus 1:5-9). Elders are to have healthy families, emotional and spiritual maturity, an ability to communicate and teach truth, and a sound reputation, not just with insiders within the faith community, but among others outside the faith community, who don’t believe what they do. Now, the community recognizes together that they have become older siblings, whose leadership is worthy to be honored and respected. Reviewing the Circle Here’s our way of doing peer-based review in the KC Underground. Each member of our circle, those who lead equipping teams and function as elders, are officially reviewed by a peer, a person to their “right and left,” every four months. Those who are to your “right and left,” shift as you cycle through the entire circle over time. Once a year, you receive the feedback of the entire circle in an annual review. Of course, between the official reviews is a continuous cycle of peer-based feedback facilitated by weekly meetings and life together. We look at areas like: Celebration: What are this person’s unique contributions? What is their sweet spot? Constipation: Where are they stuck? What is this person blind spots? Disposition: What level of Emotional, Relational and Spiritual Maturity are they displaying? Execution: How productive are they? How well do they keep their promises? How well are they living into their sweet spot? The goal of eldership is that of facilitation, guidance, equipping, mentoring, nurture, and ultimately, service. Peer Coaching and Mentoring For teams, the most important remembrance is: You are in a peer relationship with those around you. This means each member commits to be both willing to give and receive feedback, critique, encouragement, and opinion in the spirit of generous discourse among the other team members. The commitment is to actively view one another as a peer mentor and for each person to broaden their view of their own responsibilities. Everyone vows to keep eyes, ears, and minds open to issues, opportunities, threats, and solutions. When people work together with freedom as an overarching premise, they are motivated not by a single charismatic leader but by the shared vision and goals that come from the mission itself. In a setting such as this team members are peers, working together as such and holding one another accountable for the overall performance and results of the group as a whole. Boss/Manager Facilitator/Coach/Mentor/Equipper CEOs Co-Workers/Peers Rank-based Titles Role-based Titles Hierarchy of Positions Hierarchy of Processes To be a lone chief atop a pyramid is abnormal and corrupting. None of us are perfect by ourselves, and all of us need the help and correcting influence of close colleagues. When someone is moved atop a pyramid, that person no longer has colleagues, only subordinates. Even the frankest and bravest of subordinates do not talk with their boss in the same way that they talk with their colleagues who are equals, and normal communication patterns become warped. -Robert Greenleaf60 Moving past pyramid style organizational structures and circling up in our leadership systems does not create a dull or weak uniformity. Peer led groups, churches, and organizations are not seeking to equalize individual power and talent. They are working to equalize opportunities across the field of their organization. Realizing that wisdom, knowledge, and understanding is exponentially available in the whole group rather than the select few, the circle-celled group leverages its best ideas and abilities in the moment of need or opportunity. Chapter 6 The Self-Management Starfish Freedom & Order You don’t manage your peers, You collaborate with them. –Jeffrey Nielsen For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. afternoon the Senior Pastor knocked on my (Lance) office door and stopped in for a brief chat. He was in a cheerful mood with nothing in particular on his mind. “Just wanted to drop by and see how you’re doing,” he said with a smile. We chatted for a few minutes before he went on his way. After he left, I went back to what I was doing before he came in. But I became aware of something about my demeanor while in his presence. “What is this strange feeling that’s come over me?” I wondered. It took a couple of minutes of pondering and then I had it. I felt like a little boy while I was in the presence of the SP. It was a strange phenomenon but that was precisely it. Here I was, a 41-year-old man who had managed to get married, own a home, raise three children, plant and pastor several churches, grill steaks without burning the house down, and drive myself to work. Yet, I felt like an adolescent in the moment. Something was being projected in the relationship between the SP and myself. We were not on equal footing. I was constantly looking up at him and he was looking down on me. Relational dynamics change when we operate from rank-based systems. Colleagues are lost at the expense of subordinates. The confusing thing is that the pastor I am speaking of is a wonderful man. I love him dearly and am beyond thankful for so much that he has taught me. He is not a jerk. It would be much easier for people trapped in spider leadership cultures to pinpoint it if all senior leaders were complete jerks. We could just say, “The guy is a jerk and he leads like a jerk.” The hitch is that a lot of Godly folks lead in ungodly ways. So, it took a while to put my finger on what I was feeling. But after a few months of working at this church I was finally able to get my head around it. The leadership environment in place was not only mechanistic it was paternalistic. For anyone other than the select Executive leadership team, self-management was out of bounds. Staff members outside that exclusive group knew in their hearts they were more than capable of doing their jobs. But being subjected to a command and control culture projected a parent-child atmosphere upon them and it had produced a devastating effect among the most tenured of staff. It had eroded their confidence, and it showed. They had been reduced and their souls were suffering. I had wondered why there was a somewhat broken spirit in several of those who had served the church for some years. These were very sharp, extremely godly men and women, full of talent and superb gift mixes and experience. One evening I told my wife, “There is something I can see in their eyes. It is a longing. It is like an unfulfilled desire that even diminishes their smiles. They are like a corral full of powerful horses, that once were free to run and jump with boundless joy and energy but have become broken stable ponies—relegated to lopping walks and controlled trots—in service of the dude ranch trail boss for the paying customers.” There were a handful of us that joined the staff around the same time and there was a discernable difference in our energy and spirit—early on. We were all very upbeat. But we were changing too. Being under the management thumb was throttling the blood flow. Like an improperly placed tourniquet the lifeblood was being choked down. We were slowly becoming numb too. As I began to experience the over-managed culture it became clear this atmosphere would break one’s spirit. Margaret Wheatley speaks to why this is the case We have people in the organization ready and willing to do good work, wanting to contribute their ideas, ready to take responsibility, and leaders holding them back, insisting that they wait for decisions or instructions. The result is dispirited employees and leaders wondering why no one takes responsibility or gets engaged anymore. We have known for more than half a century that self-managed teams are far more productive than any other form of organizing. There is a clear correlation between participation and productivity; in fact, productivity gains in truly selfmanaged work environments are at minimum 35 percent higher than in traditionally managed organizations.61 Everything we are pointing to in this chapter gives obedience and process to Jesus’ leadership philosophy. He puts it out as a direct commandment to the small group of disciples he is pouring himself into as the future shapers of his church: Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you.” –Matthew 20:25-26a But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many —Matthew 20:26b-28 Getting honest with the Lord and ourselves demands we ask hard questions of ourselves and give honest answers as to if we lord over anyone on our staff or in the organization: Do I dictate how they use their time? Do I interrupt their space or speech in ways they are fearful of doing in like kind to me? Can questions, critique, and challenges be shared without fear of demotion, firing, or sharp rebuke? Does everyone have free access to everyone? Do I pull rank or project intimidation at times? The answers to these few questions are hints as to whether or not we are embracing and obeying Jesus’ ethos of leadership, which is based on serving, and is in direct conflict to much of modernity’s ways and means of leadership, which is being served by others. In recent years the universally accepted rank-based title of Senior Pastor has become so ingrained in evangelical churches that it has yielded a spin-off some call the second chair. Usually titled Executive Pastor, this position joins the senior pastor to form a dynamic duo atop the local church leadership hierarchy. In the opening words of their book Leading from the Second Chair, Bonem and Patterson set the stage for the top-down ideology that is so prevalent across the evangelical church landscape today: We have been frequent consumers of books, tapes, and conferences as a means of improving our leadership. Yet we have often felt frustration or discouragement after using these resources because they were not aimed at us. Their focus was the senior leader of the organization, the person who has the freedom and relative autonomy that comes with this top position. In the second chair, the amount of change you can initiate is limited because you are not the vision caster, the lead leader. You do not have to be the number two person in an organizational hierarchy to be a second chair leader. In fact, our definition can include anyone who is not the lead leader. Every organization has a perceived pecking order.62 (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2005), 1, 3. Lead Pastor? The Bible never refers to a human being as a “head” or “lead/senior pastor” of a church. This title exclusively belongs to Jesus Christ. He is the only Head of the church. Quite simply there is no analog for the modern idea of “lead pastor” anywhere in the New Testament. Some might say, “The first three chapters in Revelation speak of an angel for each church. Isn’t that symbolic of a lead pastor?” Scholars are unsure of what the angel symbolizes and beyond the obvious interpretation of it being an actual angel, any other applications are cryptic at best. In the New Testament, every clear instance we see is that of a circle of elders (Acts 20:17; Acts 20:28), leadership was always plural. There is no nuance of top-down language here. Phrases such as “senior leader,” “top position,” “lead leader,” “organizational hierarchy,” and “pecking order” make it staunchly clear that one person is on top and that everyone else descends from there.63 And there is no embarrassment or shame in the terms used. This is patent disregard for the ethos Jesus said he wanted for his church and his followers to lead enterprises in. If you are a senior leader, think back to a time when you were not in a top tier position. How did you feel being bossed and controlled? How did it affect your creativity and spirit? Very few people want to be controlled. In their book, Accountability: Freedom and Responsibility without Control, Lebow and Spitzer say “As individuals become more self-confident in their ability to be great, they simply can no longer live in a management-employee context that continues to attempt to subtly manipulate or control them in a paternalistic way. And so, they eventually leave the organization looking for more freedom.” By its very nature control perpetuates a search for escape by the one being controlled. Eventually the best talent in control-minded groups departs in search of freedom of expression. Not surprisingly, within the next year or so there was an almost entire staff turnover in the church I have just written about. The Lord Almighty created our world in such a way that it organizes and manages itself. The majority of the ecological problems our earth experiences come from the actions of mankind. The infamous dustbowl that ravaged the American and Canadian prairies of the 1930’s came about because of irresponsible farming methods that overtly damaged millions of acres of land. As rotation farming was learned the land repaired itself and another such disaster has yet to happen again. Chaos and eventual collapse will surely arrive if we simply jettison traditional management systems. Moving beyond the pyramid requires us to reinvent practices and processes in our organization. A lot of questions need answers: Who makes decisions on what gets done? How are people held answerable for their actions and performance? What happens when team members are not in agreement? The first step toward creating leadership cultures of adult-to-adult relationships is to install systems of self-management. Choosing freedom strips “all of our control-based assumptions and challenges our capacity to trust our people...that every staff member at every level is fully accountable for his or her ideas, actions, behaviors, and performance, without anyone looking over his or her shoulder.”64 This means we determine to stop controlling people. When we do so we must commit to these foundational steps towards creating a self-management culture: We trust our people You will never see the best out of anyone when they must seek your approval. Policies and procedures that demonstrate a lack of confidence in our people not only stifle risk-taking creativity, they bog down progress. Our people have the freedom to do their job as they see fit Let individuals bring their style and creativity to bear upon their tasks. Just as there is no single correct batting stance for hitting a baseball (just take a look at videos of some of the all-time great baseball greats) or one way to swing a golf club or throw a football, there is no one correct way of getting every job done. Teams and individuals set their own goals Rather than having goals set for us, when we set our own goals, we naturally feel the responsibility for meeting them as well as monitoring the results along the way. When we dictate policies, people lose empowerment. Everyone shares their goals and holds one another accountable for progress and results. The truth keeps us free When information concerns someone (or a group) within the organization, don’t hide it behind closed doors. Unlock it. People deserve to be kept informed. Jesus taught us that truth sets us free only when we know it. Never pull rank or project intimidation to anyone at any skillset level as regards his or her right to speak up on an issue. Information and resources will not be held in control my any one person or sub-group of any size. Leadership is an issue of power. In any given group it’s essence and outcomes come down to how power is viewed, exerted, released, and respected. When we choose partnership over paternalism, we carry out the “intention to balance power between ourselves and those around us.”65 We choose to release control to the nearest places the work is done. This doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Well thought out policies and practices are crucial. Among the most rewarding fruits of self-management comes from the impact it has upon the responsibility and ownership throughout the entire organizational culture. It yields quicker response and higher degrees of accurate answers to needs as they present themselves. Let’s look at some keyways our associations can reorganize via self-management. Willie Mays is considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time. Yet he failed to get a hit in his first three major league games. Downcast and distraught with an expectation that he was about to be yanked from the lineup, everything changed when his Manager, Leo Durocher said, “Listen to me, Willie. You are my centerfielder. Nothing is going to change that. Go out and play. Go out there and have some fun.” Mays started hitting that day and continued to do so for 21 seasons, ending up in the Hall of Fame. Such is the role of a good coach or consultant. We all learn through struggles. Leo Durocher knew Willie Mays was naturally talented. Though he oversaw the team he knew he could never hit like Willie could. He didn’t need to tell his player how to hit a baseball. The problem was that Mays was pressing. The pressure to perform was locking up his natural greatness. Great coaches focus on stirring up inherent strengths and existing capabilities in their players by projecting confidence and trust. The undergirding effect of trust is that it breeds confidence in the one that knows he is being trusted. It results in a relaxed approach that causes talent to do its thing naturally and unforced. A commitment to trust produces a culture whereby people across the board feel respected and taken seriously. Leadership guru Max De Pree suggests, “Respect demands that we first recognize each other’s gifts and strengths and interests; then we must integrate them into the work of the organization.”66 This speaks to a change in paradigm necessary among senior leaders as to how they view their roles. It is essential if we are serious about transitioning a rank-based organization into a role-based team of partners. To do so means we transition from controlling to consulting, from calculating to coaching. A good consultant listens more than she tells. Consultants and coaches focus on the common goals, collect and disseminate necessary information, and work to deliver the needed information and resources into the hands of the ones who are closest to an issue. This role aims to enrich and endow those that already have the skill set to solve a particular problem or create new opportunities. Take Tom Brady, nine-time Super Bowl quarterback. He is arguably the greatest quarterback of all time. Yet, he has a quarterback coach. Two things come to the fore with that thought in mind. First off, just the fact that Tom Brady still has a quarterback coach. The great Tom Brady benefits from having a consultant helping him with the nuance of his craft. Secondly, you probably have never heard of Tom Brady’s quarterback coach. Why? Because that guy—whatever his name is—isn’t trying to be a star. He knows his job is to help Tom Brady be the best quarterback he can be. This is the mindset we should crave. It brings to life the instructions in Ephesians chapter four by “equipping the saints for the work of service.”67 The job of a New Testament believing leader is to help the ones around her be the best they can be in service of the Kingdom of Heaven. It means we are convinced the skill and knowledge for whatever needs to be done is inherent in the team. Advising on peer-based organizations, Jeffrey Nielson writes, “When you trust your people and seek to consult them, not control them, and when you trust the intellectual capital already in the organization...you are cooperating with the self-organizing dynamic in organizations.” We cannot expect people to take risks if we demand they get inspection and approval at every step of the process. We must place faith in our coworker’s commitment to stewardship. Do we really believe in their faithfulness to utilize the organizations time and resources in a God honoring way that will produce the greatest yield? Self-management sounds like flowing green pastures of freedom at first, and it is. But higher degrees of freedom only last with greater degrees of responsibility. Entering these meadowlands means we can no longer hide in the barns of blaming bosses for our own mistakes, laziness or indifference. To be treated like and adult requires acting like one. 66Pree, Max De. Leading Without Power: Finding Hope In Serving Community.
