---# T Unleashing the Leadership Potential of Churches and Organizations # Ori Brafman NewYorkTimes Bestselling Author Lance Ford \ Rob Wegner # Reimagining Church Chapter 1 Arachnophobia and Spider Bites The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence –it is to act with yesterday’s logic –Peter Drucker Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you.” –Matt. 20:25-26a The morning newsfeed opens with, yet another story of a high-profile pastor or faith-based leader caught up in a swirl of accusation. Patterns of sustained abuse of one sort or another such as bullying, misuse of position, sexual harassment, or just a plain mental breakdown from the weight of leading has come to light. Pastor Smith of Well-Known Church has resigned, been fired, or is fending off allegations. When the downfall of famed leadership expert and pastor Bill Hybels came to fruition, the church world was shocked and in dismay. As more and more credible witnesses came forth a pattern of decades long positional leveraging and abuse came to light. Arguably the most influential shaper of evangelical church leadership over the last 50 years had tumbled. And it was the very leadership systems he had purveyed all along that served to camouflage his actions along the way. Upon hearing each story, we wonder, “Why does this keep happening and who will be next?” The stories have become predictably familiar—unhealthy and ungodly patterns and habits budding and building under the cloak of leadership power, rank, privilege, or the stress of responsibility overload. Though we are always saddened at such news we are becoming less and less surprised. We are usually just disappointed and dismayed that it was that person. But spider webs are like that. They are most often quite invisible until you get very close to them. Have you ever walked into a spider web or been bitten by a spider? Most likely you had never noticed the web was there until you were already entangled. Or you didn’t feel the bite at first but at some point, discovered a sore or infected spot on some part of your body. Only then did you realize an arachnid had bitten you. This book is written differently than most books. First, a blessing from an Israeli-Berkley-leadership guru to Three Amigos. Three of us, a South African born Australian transplant leadership guru, a native Texan, and a Midwestern All American , have come together to share our stories, experiences, and findings with a goal of helping churches and faith based leaders in general to move past spidery experiences so they can grow flourishing cultures to help them and their teams fulfill the purpose and mission of their organizations. With four combined decades of serving as pastors in large, successful churches, and as trainers to thousands of pastors, we (Rob and Lance) both agree that something is amiss in church leadership. Our journeys within the local church have made us weary of spider bites, the wounds of hierarchical, complicated, and heavy-handed leadership. And we admit up front that we have been spider-men ourselves at different times. Hard work was to be expected, but the business of church seems to have become supplanted with the busyness of church and an increasing reliance upon human power in lieu of heavenly power. For us, things got so toxic from the many spider bites that we both resigned positions in large, successful churches. Those crises sent us searching for ways of leading that ring truer to the character of our spiritual leader—Christ—and the things He said about leadership. Alan has been a big brother, mentor, and dear friend to both of us. It is by no means an overstatement to declare that his influence thoroughly changed our lives and ministries. Through his writing and speaking Alan’s insight into the contemporary church since the turn of the new millennial has affected positive changes arguably like no other. So we asked Alan to step into this book project, providing his thoughts on our thoughts. As you read this book our aim and hope for you is that we convey a more joyful and productive—less costly at the human level—leadership ethos that will help you develop a culture that reflects these thoughts: The idea that Jesus provided his leadership model as one that rather than rising, by creating an ascending pyramid to elevate himself, his was a descending circle that empowered others. His initial circle, reproduced similar circles, filling culture with humble servants who also lead courageously, by making heroes of others, empowering and equipping them to be all God has made them to be. The primary forms of leadership we have been using continue to produce a human cost that is completely unnecessary. Edwards Deming is credited with saying, “Every system is perfectly designed to get the results that it does.” As we embark on the third decade of the new millennium the entertainment industry, corporate business world, and church and faith community has been rocked by a succession of leaders who have been brought down in disgraceful fashion for patterns of behavior linked to bullying, domineering, and abuse of different kinds. On the faith front several high-profile leaders have resigned their posts solely out of exhaustion or for slipping into self-destructive patterns. Some of these leaders were just plain worn out from the weight of carrying a church or organization on one set of shoulders. Our primary leadership models have emerged from the industrial revolution and the renaissance age that produced singular charismatic hero types. The influence of these eras has had an enormous shaping impact on our current leadership ways and means. Much of what emerges from such concepts runs counter to the culture God advocates for the church and faith-based leadership at large. We are at a junction in church and faith leadership where credibility and integrity are justly being doubted. We need to ask some uneasy questions about ourselves. The answers we will find not only can lead us to truth but to the truth that will set us free—free to be all that God has designed us to be personally, professionally, and for the sake of the world around us. Most churches and faith groups, large or small, have the inherent competency and capacity to flourish already in place. What is needed is an understanding of how to unleash the latent wisdom, understanding, talents, and joy that will fuel their tasks and journey. We (Rob and Lance) will share our own firsthand spidery experiences throughout the book as well as stories and situations we have encountered in several years of working with faith leaders throughout North America and globally. Alan will speak to various issues and contexts throughout the book, bringing his advice and experience to bear upon the topics and subjects at hand. What A Tangled Web (Lance’s Story) The first time I (Lance) knew a spider leader had bitten me was shortly after joining the staff of a medium sized West Texas church, straight out of bible college. My initial stint on a church staff was as a youth pastor at a small but healthy fellowship during my bible school years. Sam, the pastor of that church led from a joyful and loving humility. He was patient, forgiving, sharing, secure in who he was, and treated no one as lesser than himself. Resolute when necessary but always fair and open to viewpoints not his own, Sam’s leadership style seemed to match up with the character and fruit I imagined from the shepherd leaders I had studied in the bible. But things would be different at my first postgraduate assignment on the dusty West Texas plains. Within three months I had been screamed at over the phone, physically shoved against an office wall, reprimanded through gritted teeth multiple times, and had my complete wardrobe replaced—all by the senior “shepherd”. This was the first time I ever heard a pastor declare, “Church is a business and has to be run like a business.” It wouldn’t be the last time. Over the next ten years or so I would take on spider leadership tendencies myself. Like thousands of other young pastors and church planters I sought the best leadership conferences and read every leadership book I could find, especially those recommended by pastors of well-known and growing churches. I was seeking wisdom and advice from my heroes, pastors who had grown big churches. As I was about to embark on starting a new church near St. Louis, the answer one such pastor gave to me when I asked him for the most important ingredient in planting a successful church was two words, “The guy.”—i.e. a single standout hero type. In other words, my inner Peter Parker would need to get his spider game on. So, for the next few years I continued to focus on learning leadership from the most notable authors and speakers and the theme continued to galvanize: Being a great leader must be a main goal and leadership is about being a person who has the charisma, talent, expertise, and authority to get others to follow him or herself. The overarching idea was that building a great church or faith community involves creating a well-oiled leadership machine with structures and systems promoting the vision of the visionary and the mission he or she lays out and charts the course toward. As the years wore on I began to develop a growing unease and disenchantment with much of what I was seeing, reading, hearing—and quite frankly was doing myself—in relation to church leadership, along with the weight and pressure to “make it work” and “make it grow”. So much of the ways and means of leadership seemed to ignore the habits and character of Jesus and what I read in the New Testament epistles regarding the treatment of others. On top of it all was a particular loneliness of being the guy. Something seemed off. I wondered how one person could be expected to have the stamina and energy to carry so much leadership weight and pressure. And who in their right mind—or ego—believed one human could have the talent, giftings, and wisdom capacity to know what should always be done? Midway through the first decade of the new millennium, after ten years of leading the church I founded in St. Louis I resigned out of senior pastor exhaustion to lead the church planting efforts and serve on the pastoral staff of a large church in Texas. The mistake I made was that I ran deeper into the very system and leadership myth I was seeking to escape from. I went from being the spider to being the one caught in the spider web. This would be the highest command and control environment I had ever been part of. Not long before I arrived a new Executive Pastor had been installed with the task of overseeing and managing the entire pastoral staff. He was a really brilliant and nice guy that was never even remotely harsh toward me or anyone else to my knowledge. But it seemed quite odd that someone who had precisely zero experience as a pastor or church leader, much less any formal theological training, was giving daily marching orders to the entire spiritual leadership community of the church. Several of us on the staff had pastored flourishing churches. Nevertheless, this 2nd Chair leader (as some call them) had an impressive resume from the corporate world and therefore was deemed perfectly suited to lead this church in its operational basis. This practice has become common among contemporary churches. The Executive Pastor stood between the Senior Pastor and the rest of the staff and was in control of day-to-day functions in a clear line of authority. Policy decisions, schedules, strategic initiatives, all of it, were the prerogative of the EP. Those under the EP were in place to implement the marching orders of the Senior and Executive Pastors without question. This leadership paradigm assumes the need for clear lines of demarcation or boxes that separate the thinkers from the doers. It is classic top-down. Thinking happens at the top and doing happens at the bottom. Information, disseminated on a need-to-know basis, created a cloud of unease over the pastoral staff. Otherwise secure, gregarious, boisterous men and women became subdued and even childlike when the Senior Pastor entered the room. The atmosphere contained a discernable aspect of secrecy and distrust. And it was the SP and EP who decided what and who would know whatever and whenever. Coming from a corporate command and control culture, the Executive Pastor considered it his job to manage everyone’s schedule. One morning after hearing that a couple of staff pastors and I were spending the first 20 minutes of our mornings together in a time of worship with a guitar, he called me to his office to tell me we would need to “do that on your own time.” Taken aback, I asked him if he thought I was doing well with my area of responsibilities. “Mike, do you think I’m getting my job done? Do you think the other guys are getting their jobs done?” I asked. He enthusiastically said, “Oh, yeah, you guys are doing great.” “Then what is the rub? What does it matter to you how we start our days?” He answered, “Because this is the office. The office is for business. And it’s my job to maintain that.” Leadership cultures fueled by management systems such as this contain a belief that people perform best under controls and guidelines. It is as if there are only a few adults in the mix and the rest are incompetent or lacking the crucial self-motivation or self-discipline to carry out the areas they are tasked to. Church business has to come this. By the mid 1990’s two decades of what was called the church growth movement shifted focus as more and more leaders in the field of faith became fixated on the subject of leadership. The trend has continued to the present. The mantra, “everything rises or falls on leadership” is almost universally unquestioned by learned pastors and faith leaders. And there is at least a shade of truth in that saying. What is seldom questioned though is the type of leadership our future depends upon. Today the primary idea is that to develop a healthy and flourishing faith organization means there has to be a single leader that stands out as the best strategist, theologian, visionary, communicator, and CEO. Over recent years as the leadership emphasis took front and center, before anyone seemed to notice, the faith community was looking outside of itself and the wisdom of the sacred texts for its primray leadership answers from the corporate sector. It wasn’t long until tens of thousands of faith leaders had attended church sponsored summits with speakers from Bill Clinton to Melinda Gates and kept bookshelves housing volumes written by or about such luminaries as Attila the Hun to “Neutron” Jack Welch. If church is a business, then why not learn from those who are best at business was the rationale. This is not to say there is not much to be learned from business leaders. In fact, in this book we will be drawing on concepts from the business world. The issue in such learning is that the advice and practices we accept from anyone must pass through the filter of Jesus—his ways, ethics, commandments, and heart. The F Word (Rob’s Story) I (Rob) was one of those eager students, learning all I could from leaders from every sector of society. I do believe all truth is God’s truth. Therefore, leadership truth can be discovered and applied from every sector. However, my mindful critique of these sources was not thorough enough. Without realizing, I was importing extrabiblical frameworks and principles. Over time, I began to feel the corrosive effect. It came to a head at a surprising moment. Some twenty years into my vocational ministry journey in a large church, I was on a five-day retreat to be spent in silence at a monastery. This was part of a larger sabbatical given to me after those twenty years of service. The first two nights, I didn’t sleep well, tossing and turning the whole night. Nightmares plagued me. I was exhausted by day three. That afternoon, I had finished praying the midafternoon office with the monks. As I made my way back to my cabin, my thoughts drifted toward an individual, a church leader, whom I loved dearly, my boss, and without a doubt, one of the most meaningful mentors of my life. I stand on his shoulders. He’s believed in me and blessed me in ways beyond number. And yet, as his face came to mind, a torrent of anger burst up out of me, along with a string of expletives that I won’t print here. To say that I was shocked would be an understatement. I felt dizzied and mumbled, “Where in hell did that come from?” Up to that point, I wasn’t living with any vivid awareness of that venom in my soul. On the surface, I thought I was experiencing the typical frustrations common in any church. My soul was apparently telling me otherwise. The explosion of rage felt so primal and involuntary, like vomiting a bad meal that has given you food poisoning. This poison was from spider-bites…many of them. In the aftermath, as the wave of rage passed, at first, I was ashamed that I had said the F word, cursing someone I loved. However, the revealing of that feeling was the beginning of the healing. I prayed, “Lord, help me to understand what is going on in the mystery of my heart.” Over the next few hours and days of solitude, as I prayed and journaled, the scales began to fall off my eyes. Habitual behaviors in this person’s life had wounded me, but the problem was more systemic than that. A tangled web of “leadership” values and tactics had enmeshed me and many others, perpetuating spider-bites. Our church wasn’t unique in this. These were values and tactics championed in the church growth movement and studied in church leadership conferences, which had now become normative in thousands of churches. Suddenly, this twenty-year, singular hero story about a progressive, prevailing church plant that became one of the most influential mega-churches in America, flipped into a multi-level horror story. Later, I would be able to see the complexity and nuance of the story – both its beauty and brokenness, both the hero and horror in a fuller way. No story or life is just one thing. In that moment, however, the dark side of the story, which I had largely repressed, looked away from, or excused, swallowed me. In the darkness, we usually look for someone else to blame, to absolve ourselves from the problem. But I knew in that moment, I was complicit. During those days of solitude, in prayer and journaling, I revisited the deep places of idolatry in my soul that had allowed me to lose my way. I revisited the wounds and wept. Jesus met my F word with an even stronger F word. By God’s grace, I was able to receive and also pass on what had been given to me in limitless measure: Forgiveness. As a young man, what I had seen as powerful and progressive in church leadership in my twenties, now at the dawn of my forties, felt crushing and suffocating. Upstairs, I looked like I had it going on. Down in the basement, I had a heavy, dirty soul. The hurt inflicted by that pastor, the impact of a toxic culture and the shame I felt over the ways I exerted my influence for my benefit –all of it had been buried deep in the basement of my soul and hidden behind a false wall. The combination of the three days of silence and prayer mixed with the physical exhaustion, not to mention the preceding detonations set off by the spiritual directors my wife and I had been meeting with, caused that wall to crumble. The years of hurt I had buried, the undercover sense of shame over my contribution to a contaminated leadership culture, and all the unforgiveness I had harbored came pouring out. By the end of the retreat, I literally felt a hundred pounds lighter. I slept like a baby those last few nights. But the most difficult season of my life lay ahead. The soul work had only begun. During the next season, I found myself at a crossroads, as the pastor and the culture of that church continued harder and faster in the same direction. Prior to this sabbatical, the pathway was clear. Most people assumed I was the heir apparent. Now, I felt lost. Dante describes the experience this way: “In the middle of life, I found myself in a dark wood.”1 The dark night of the soul. I remember the darkest point. It was literally a pitch-dark night in the dead of winter, I walked alone on the gravel berm of a country road. Our town wasn’t incorporated, so no sidewalks. Figures, right? A few hundred yards away, the headlights were barreling towards me, on my side of the road. The thought in my head, stuck on repeat, skipping like a scratched record, "End it." As the car closed in, I thought, "It would be so much easier to just step in front of that car. I'm just two feet away from the pain being over." That's where my two-decade journey with church leadership had landed me. A collision of crises in the church and our family, a toxic church leadership culture, and unresolved wounds from my past, combined into a season of depression that was so dark, there were days where I was non-functional. I questioned all my deepest held beliefs. More than once I thought to myself, “I think they’ll pull my pastor card if I end up an atheist.” The darkness went on not for days or weeks, but months. I kept muscling my way through. Externally, I was the envy of my peers. A church of thousands. A national reputation. A book published with just the right publisher in just the right book series. Gigs at the cool conferences. Coaching and training other church leaders. Internally, I was crushed to the point of despair. As I continued to do deeper soul work with a spiritual director and moved regularly into inner healing prayer with another mentor, I felt like the blind man who had the two-stage restoration of sight. First things were blurry, but with Jesus’s continued touch, clarity increased. Of course, this miracle in Mark 8:22-25 was proceeded with a question meant to provoke his “blind” disciples in Mark 8:21, “Do you still not understand?” A bit at a time, I understood more deeply. Jesus and the Gospel could meet my deepest needs. A bit at a time, I understood more deeply. The leadership model championed in the modern church had become a confused web of unanchored Bible verses, cut and paste business practices, unedited marketplace values, and unchecked motives, where many great “leaders” are unconsciously working out of their own woundedness through narcissism and power tactics. I had seen the dark underbelly of many churches. You can’t be much more of an insider in the megachurch world than I have been. A few examples, for your consideration. These are run of the mill, not the zingers. In an important private meeting about the future of the church, with just myself and the other “top” two guys, one of them said, “I see this church as a business with three co-owners. That’s whose sitting at this table, the co-owners of this church.” Are we going to cut Jesus in and give Him 25% of His church too? Before a conference we were hosting, I wanted to welcome one of the keynote speakers and introduce myself. I stuck my head into the green room and said, “I just wanted to welcome Steven.” One of his entourage intervened, stepped in front of me, and said, “He is not Steven. He is Pastor Steve. That is the title of honor he deserves.” With the grace of Michael Scott, I awkwardly slide back out of the room, making eye contact with the PASTOR, who did not speak to me. Only one Person in the New Testament receives the “title” of lead pastor (1 Peter 5:4). His name isn’t Steven. While interviewing for a job with one of the most influential pastors in the world, one of the staff members said to my wife, “Think of Rob’s potential stint here like military service. Imagine he’s serving in Afghanistan on a two-year tour of duty. You won’t see him much, but you’ll know he’s making a difference somewhere. Then, at the end of the two years, he’ll be back home. He can put on his resume that he worked at church. At that point, the sky’s the limit on consulting or working wherever he wants!” Ah, where’s that verse in the Bible that says, “Being a shepherd is a career pathway to be managed for upward mobility and personal profit.” Or the one that says, “They who ignore their spouse for a few years are blessed, as long as your mistress is the Church.” The tactics and values seen as necessary for the maintenance of leadership excellence in the church, have often been shaming and bullying tactics that have crushed people’s souls. Patterns lauded as sure-fire ways to build a culture of honor and gratitude, have, in fact, created a culture of celebrity for a few in each church and a caste system for the rest. When the Church is dysfunctional, it is the most appalling of all institutions because the stakes are so high, precisely because her potential for beauty is so great and our love for her is so deep The Spider, The Starfish, Ori, Lance, and Rob Many of the leadership concepts utilized by today’s faith communities are built on the very things Jesus clearly rebuked. We design systems in pyramid form, usually with one person or a few at the top with dominant power. What Ori Brafman, in his book The Spider and the Starfish, has entitled, the Spider. This form of leadership has infected the church. As we mentioned earlier, in just the last few years, we have witnessed a pattern where every few months we receive news of yet another singular at-the-top leader either resigning or being forced to step down in light of confession or accusations of some form of bullying, abuse, or manipulation of staff members or the opposite sex. For example, famed Seattle pastor Mark Driscoll resigned after the board of elders at his church declared he had “been guilty of arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner."2 Or consider the tragic descent of Bill Hybels, as numerous women step forward courageously to uncover a pattern of oppression and manipulation that was rampant for years. Both of these individuals were lauded as “best in class” in church leadership up until the very moment the veil was pulled back. By all means, we long only for their full restoration. Their stories serve as a warning to all of us in church leadership, who at some level or another have been complicit with oppressive and self-benefiting forms of leadership, at some point in our life. But it is also about more than just individual “character flaws.” There is a system behind these failures that must be addressed. It would be incredibly naïve to write these off as merely personal failures, and not question the form of leadership and the institutional systems that form of leadership creates. Each of these situations would not have been able to be sustained in a starfish leadership culture. We must ask if more leadership is not what is needed but instead, a far different type of leadership is necessary. Rigid systems are a great fit amidst the drive for predictability, but the human cost comes as they tend to foster cultures of fear and depersonalization instead of expectation, creativity, and uniqueness. Worse yet, they are a greenhouse for domineering, bullying, and even sexual abuse. To say the least, they quench the Holy Spirit. London Business School Professor of Organizational Behavior Daniel Cable writes This so-called executive disease is common because power changes how leaders view other people—research shows that power causes people to see others as a means to their ends rather than as intelligent humans with ideas and emotions. In organizational life, power can result in arrogance and self-importance, and executives too often use their power to bully and frighten employees into compliance.3 2 https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/october-web-only/mark-driscoll-resigns-from-mars-hill.html The rank-based concepts behind spider leadership create a dichotomy: leaders, a select and privileged few, and followers, the vast majority.4 This type of thinking quashes the collective intelligence of an organization. It shuts down creativity, heart, and drive, all beneath the mindset that only a small group of “gifted” ones contain the competence for decision-making. Sadly, leadership like this slams the door on the unlimited potential of the majority of our team members. Even more tragic is the gifts that God wants to give our organizations via the silenced majority are summarily rejected by the upper echelon. When this happens, we are not playing with the full deck God has dealt us. Power hoarding through rank-based thinking has an underlying arrogance and scarcity mentality. The subtle belief is there is a rare amount of wisdom and qualified talent in the room. But the reality is there is more than enough intelligence, knowledge, creativity and experience existing in most organizations, but it is often hidden in the basement belief system of a scarcity mentality that assumes these assets are limited to a select few who occupy the loftiest titles. Cable, says, “Many organizations are deactivating the part of employees’ brains called the seeking system. Our seeking systems create the natural impulse to explore our worlds, learn about environments, and extract meaning from our circumstances.”5 The seeking system within our biological make up is not just ability for creativity; it also is a key to whether we want to crawl out of bed from morning to morning. Cable continues, “Most neuroscientists agree...that one of the most basic emotional systems pertains to a functionally identifiable circuit that depends on dopamine, and that emotional system might be called interest, anticipation, or seeking.”6 In other words, when we shut down people’s seeking systems we are choking the very life out of them. But, as you already know, another option lies open before us: The Starfish. Not long after Ori’s book The Starfish and The Spider came out a copy landed in our (Lance and Rob) mailboxes. Both of us were excited to discover someone was putting language and solutions to the problem. Albeit, Ori was not a church leader nor was the book aimed at faith organizations. Nevertheless, we both knew this is how Godly leadership should be shaped. It points us to the way we should be as leaders and how our organizations can flourish and be joyful places to work within. This agnostic professor, from one of the most secular universities in America, through his research, had rediscovered a generous, open, service-oriented, empowering form of leadership. He dubbed it “Starfish,” using the brilliant analogy of the Spider and the Starfish, comparing the two forms of leadership we’ve been contrasting. Ori articulated Starfish leadership with genius and clarity, and it begin to infect hundreds of businesses and non-profits, became a New York Times Bestseller, and eventually, even the US military officer training school began to adapt their training based on Ori’s work. Over time, by providence and blessing, Lance and Ori met at a conference, at which they were both speaking. They hit it off. Rob was friends with Lance and a super fan of Ori’s work, so Lance introduced them. Basically, a Cable Guy situation, where Rob was the Jim Carry character and Ori played Matthew Broadrick. Conversations ensued. Friendships deepened. Stereotypes were deconstructed. Spiritual journeys connected. We are grateful to Ori for his blessing to extend and reinterpret the Starfissh for the church context. From Lance and Rob’s perspective, Jesus is the origin point of Starfish leadership. Ori is reinterpreting it and, with great academic rigor, demonstrating the viability of it in every sector of society. Over the last 15 years, Rob and Lance have found Ori’s “outside” perspective both prophetic and incredibly helpful in reapplying Jesus’ leadership ethos back to the Church. What has developed is a series or system of “Starfish” that we hope will help church leaders rediscover Jesus’ leadership in a fresh and practical way. Over the course of this book we will unpack seven Starfish, that we hope will reinvigorate church leadership with the vision, values and practices to rediscover Jesus’ leadership orthodoxy and orthopraxy. The Movement Starfish: Reimagining the Church The Light Load Starfish: Distributing the Weight The Structure Starfish: Thinking Outside the Pyramid The Self-Management Starfish: Unleashing Freedom and Facilitating Order The Owner-Making Ingredients Starfish: Creating Environments The Owner-Making Ecosystem Starfish: Balancing Elements The Collective Intelligence Starfish: Process & Systems As we shared our stories earlier in this chapter, we (Lance and I) hope we don’t come off like angsty teenagers, because honestly, we love the church leaders involved in these practices. These are our people. We are for them. We are them. If you’ve been spider-bit, it’s easy to objectify and hate the pastor or church leader who hurt you. But, the “megachurch pastor” or “church leader” we want to resent, dislike or slam –– carries our own dark side. That’s why Jesus says, “Love your enemies.” If we love our enemies, eventually we’ll realize that a lot of our enemy-hating is all about us projecting our own darkness onto someone else. Our criticism of the current, prevailing church leadership approach is not blind negativity. We understand on the ground; most pastors are doing their best to lead in a faithful way. Yet, we can’t ignore the crisis. We want to stand on “the edge of the inside,” and provide a hopeful critique we pray will lead to a faithful return to what Jesus has in mind for His church. People who truly, deeply love something have earned the right to critique and help make it truer to its deepest vision. We’ve both given our entire adult lives to serving the organized church. These things of which we write, have been worked out in blood, sweat, prayer, and tears. One of the unique aspects of our Scriptures, that differs greatly from the other world religions, is that our prophets – voices like Isaiah or Jeremiah in the Old Testament and James and Paul in the New Testament are free to both profoundly love the tradition and profoundly criticize it at the same time. Their love demands that they do so. If we didn’t love the organized church and her leaders so much, we wouldn’t bother to write this book. Jesus offered this faithful critique masterfully. We seek to follow His example in these pages. As you read, we hope you feel our deep love for the church and her leaders. As you read, we also hope you feel us poking you in the chest…because, in Jesus name, you can do this. Chapter 2 “The more I consider Christianity, the more I found that while it has established a rule and order, the chief aim of that order was to give room for good things to run wild.” G.K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy. "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said. "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching.” Acts 5:28 The year, 1984: A time for huge bangs on young ladies, mullets on young men, jam shorts, ripped jeans, Michael Jackson, and hair-metal bands. Obviously, the American culture had reached a place of unrivaled refinement. A missionary kid turned youth pastor, Dan Gute, looked at this Ferris Bueller wannabe, a 14-year old version of me, and saw someone who could be a catalyst for something more than hijinks and practical jokes. He invited a rag-tag group of teenagers, about twelve oddly enough, and invited us to become disciples who could make disciples. We were young enough to believe we could do it. Over the next years, Jesus walked among us, transformed lives and turned that youth group of a sleepy, insular Baptist church into a little movement of sorts. The holy rumpus erupted in us as we experienced Jesus personally, hearing His voice and seeing His face. The good things ran wild through the halls of our schools as we shared our faith. The primal drumbeat of eternal life – not just quantity, but quality pounded in us, as we gathered around hidden firepits in the forest to pray and worship. We knew something ancient and original was happening: A holy rumpus, anchored and deeply rooted, yet unhinged and fresh. We read the book of Acts as a script we could be actors in and exclaimed to ourselves, “This is real. Jesus is actually doing this stuff today, here and now!” The whole thing felt dangerous and unpredictable. A couple years into that awakening, the number of teenagers gathered one evening in the old sanctuary was equal to the size of the entire church body. More than 40 of our friends decided to follow Jesus that night. Sure, looking back I can see the baggage we were carrying, but were unaware of. The suitcase stuffed things like a radically-reduced, wafer-thin, fire insurance version of the gospel, a young arrogance, a deep dualism that created walls between us and the whimsical, transforming, comprehensive Holiness of God that is everywhere, identities wrapped up in our religious performance, and the list of items crammed in there goes on. But none of that canceled out the essence of what was happening. Which makes it all the more amazing! The old “order” had given room for “good things to run wild.” In the afterglow of that evening, I remarked to Dan, “I’m kind of surprised all the older folks are ok with us using the sanctuary for our stuff. This was kind of a crazy night.” With a mischievous glint in his eyes, Dan grinned and replied, “Some of them know. They’ve been praying for us. But I want you to remember something, Rob. Sometimes it’s easier to ask forgiveness than permission.” In the midst of the tension between the old order, spider-like, and standing still, and the new order of starfish, decentralized expression of church, I discovered my calling to lead. What about your calling to lead? Did it come to you in the midst of good things running wild? I bet it did. You responded to that call to empower and release more good things to run wild in and through a faith community, non-profit, marketplace endeavor or wherever you make your contribution. Early in my story, I had an experience inside the old order of the church, where good things ran wild in me, and the Spirit set my soul on fire. That experience created a deep longing in me that made me say “Let the wild, holy rumpus start!” I bet you felt that too! Yet, I also wager somewhere along the line, you’ve felt the order constricting the wild, good things, to the point where they are no longer able to run wild. In most churches and organizations, the order is the only goal. In that case, any good things that are wild have to be domesticated. Eventually, one day, you realize that you’re running the order machine. In quiet moments of desperation, you think, “I didn’t sign up for this. Where did all the wild things go? I signed up to help fuel a Jesus movement, but now I feel like I’m running a machine.” In my line of work, close to fifteen hundred pastors leave the ministry every month. If they were given the opportunity to make a similar salary doing something else, most pastors surveyed said they’d jump at it. 7 Many of us are weary of being keepers of the order. My youth pastor Dan used that wild moment to help me see the embodiment of Chesterton’s essential point: The centralized expression of the faith community exists to empower and release the decentralized expression of the faith community, so good things can run wild. The center exists to empower the margins, not the other way around. That is the main thrust of this book, the restoration of the running wild decentralized expression of the church and the empowerment of the pursuant form of leadership that can and will release it. In other words, you don’t have to ask permission from “the order,” Jesus has already ordained and commissioned the good things to run wild. You can find your sacred mojo again. That does not mean we condemn or abandon the centralized form of church (or any organization bent on adding value to the world). We need both! In The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations, Ori refers to this blending as the Combo Special: The Hybrid Organization. Rather than seeing it as an either/or, Spider or Starfish, we can go the way of both/and. What kind of creature would that be? You can splice those genes in one of two ways. Either you have a Spiderfish or a Starder. Canoeing the Mountains: Christian Leadership in Uncharted Territory (p. 229). InterVarsity Press. Kindle Edition. The Spider, the Spiderfish, the Starder, and Starfish exist on a continuum, moving from centralization to decentralization. At first glance, the Spider and the Starfish are similar in appearance. They both appear to have a bunch of appendages coming out of a central body, but that’s where the similarities end. With the Spider, a head is a head, a body is a body, and a leg is a leg. You have a centralized brain calling the shots. If you chop the head off the Spider, it’s game over. However, with the Starfish you have no head. If you cut the starfish in half the animal doesn’t die, it reproduces. Now you have two starfish. A group called OUCH discovered this the hard way. OUCH – the Order of the Underwater Coral Heroes, was a group of rogue divers launched in the late 1990s, existed to defend the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The starfish were growing so numerous, they were beginning to destroy the coral. Taking matters into their own hands, they’d dive with their knives and the cut the starfish in half to kill them. One problem, the halves generated into new starfish. A two for one Starfish special! How does that happen? “They can achieve this magical regeneration because in reality, a starfish is a neural network—basically a network of cells. Instead of having a head, like a spider, the starfish functions as a decentralized network.”8 In this chapter we begin with a review of the most common understanding of the organized church (Spider) and then reimagine faith communities as flourishing, reproducing networks of reproducing owners of the faith – what Jesus called disciples transforming the world by way of good things running wild (Starfish). We will also explore the hybrids that exists between these ends of the continuum. The Spider expression is a centralized form of church oriented around one location, one congregation, and one gathering, under the authority one leadership head, usually a senior leader or pastor, working with a board or council. The locus of power is centralized in that head (represented by the blackened circle). This is the prevailing model in the American church with more than half of US Churches having one location, one service, and one leadership head9. Most organizations and businesses have this leadership model and form of governance, as well. The Spider’s locus of power works like a strand of Christmas lights. If the one bulb (the centralized locus of power in the senior pastor) at the top goes out on the single string, so does every bulb below it. The pastor and the board/staff emanate the current (direction, programs, etc.) that the congregants connect with. At the other end of the continuum, the Starfish expression is a decentralized expression of the church oriented around multiple locations, multiple congregations, multiple gatherings, and multiple leaders. Imagine the church as a decentralized network of multiplying disciples, missional leaders, and microchurches. The Starfish, within the Christian tradition, may be best represented by viral spread of the underground organic church movements in China, India, and many other places around the world. One of the greatest privileges of my life is the honor of consistently serving indigenous church planting movements in India, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, and South Africa. These Starfish leaders are among my most treasured friends, mentors, and co-laborers. Experiencing these Starfish movements firsthand has changed my sense of what is possible for the church. For example, in a 10-year window in Southern India, what started with a handful of like-minded leaders training a cohort of about 30 ordinary folks, what we would call bi-vocational pastors, multiplied into a movement of more than 2000 churches including over 180,000 people, making disciples who made disciples that formed microchurches that reproduced microchurches among unreached people in previously unreached villages. There was hardly a paid professional pastor among the whole movement. Stories like this from around the world, in our time, are multiplied in the thousands. It’s breath-taking. Returning home to help lead the modern evangelical megachurch I was pastoring was a whiplash to say the least. One Sunday, I’m watching the good things run wild, a viral movement of reproducing disciples and microchurches sweeping the land. Next Sunday, I’m back to “church as usual:” services timed to the second tracked in real-time with software, bands with lightshows and hazers, “killer” video, church programs for this and that, the next great relevant, catchy weekend series, etc., ad nauseum. Honestly, sometimes, it made my stomach hurt. Don’t misunderstand, I was for all those things. God was using them to draw people to himself and then transform them. And yet, against the backdrop of this disciple-making movement in India, by comparison, so few were truly being empowered to their maximum influence. People had to settle for being a “volunteer.” We were growing by addition, yet so few were actually making new disciples themselves. One needed to bring them to a building for service or a program designed by a paid professional, who could do the heavy lifting for you. By God’s grace, I had enough experience to know that responding like an angry adolescent, screaming, “Burn it down!” would be a waste. That posture would have caused me to miss the point of what the Spirit was saying and teaching me. What was the Spirit saying to me? “Rob, why not here? Why not now?” He is still saying that to me... daily, hourly, moment by moment. It has gripped my soul. How about you? Starfish doesn’t just happen “over there.” Here in the States, my friend Brian Sanders and a handful of Starfish leaders have been the spark for a similar movement in Tampa Florida, called the Underground Network, which has now reproduced more than 300 micro-churches. That has spanned new microchurch movements in 21 other cities, including the Kansas City Underground, the family of microchurches here in KC, which I serve and lead. Or consider one of my coaches, Jeff Vanderstelt, and the Soma movement. What started as a handful of missional communities in Tacoma, has now become a network of hundreds of missional communities gathering in congregations in 48 cities. How about the amazing movement Jesus has unleashed through Hope Chapel and the leadership of Ralph Moore? More than 2300 churches and counting! These are expressions of church that are growing not just by addition, but multiplication. No matter how fast you hit the addition button, it can’t keep up with the impact of multiplication. The Exponential church planting network has created and entitled this expression of church as Level 5: Multiplying. At this level, disciples and churches are multiplying on multiple strands out to at least, the fourth generation. In comparison, Level 1 churches are subtracting, and Level 2 churches are plateaued. Currently, right at 80% of the churches in America are at level 1 and 2. Level 3 churches are adding, growing by addition by finding and solving the problems that limit growth. This growth happens mostly through innovating on the methods of the church growth movement, scaling that out through multiple venues or multisite. Currently, 16% of the churches in America are growing by addition. Level 4 churches are reproducing. This is largely represented by the massive growth of church planting. At Level 4, leaders are no longer just thinking about putting more trees in their orchard through multisite, rather they are interested in planting new orchards by planting churches that plant churches. Approximately 4% of U.S. churches are growing by reproduction. Against that backdrop, Level 5 Multipliers, however, see multiplying disciples, leaders, mircochurches, large churches, and networks as normal. They are planning for gospel saturation in a city or region. Their scorecard is no longer “how many have accumulated at the center,” but “how many have been sent to the margins to multiple disciples and churches.” Level Five is represented by less than .005 percent of U.S. churches.10 At Levels 1 and 2 the message is ‘Please stay.’ At Levels 3 and 4 the message is ‘Please come.’ At Level 5 the faith community is a launchpad saying, ‘Please GO!’ Maybe you’re wondering, “Isn’t Level 5 just another denomination? Or what about a church with a larger number of multisites, like LifeChurch.tv11, isn’t that level 5? Aren’t those considered Starfish?” Remember on the surface, spiders and starfish can look the same in appearances. It’s what happening beneath the surface in terms of the locus of power that makes the difference between a Spider Church and a Starfish Church. In denominations and franchise multisites (multisites that clone the original site with tight control on branding, decision making and teaching), the locus of power is like a hub and spokes. The power flows from the hub out and down along the spokes. If the hub is removed, the network disappears. If the main church in the franchise multisite network, which distributes to the multisites were to turn off, the entire network disappears. Similarly, in many denominations, churches agree on common theological and philosophical distinctives and choose to relate under a centralized authority. Denominations have credentialing processes, dedicated educational institutions, mission agencies, and an agreed upon hierarchy. If somehow an entire denominational head was removed in one moment, the denomination would either disperse, or they would need to immediately appoint a new head. I know of one major denomination right now that has several new heads developing in backroom conversations because of a theological controversy. They want to be ready to have a new hub and spoke network in place, when it comes time to pull out of the old one. Anyone want to be the new bishop? In the Starfish expression, the locus of power is spread throughout the network in many locations, leaders and teams, like the internet. The power doesn’t reside in one starfish, but multiple starfish that operate like nodes throughout the network. The power and information move in multiple directions, depending on the usage and need within the network. The goal is to multiply and connect disciples, leaders, teams, churches, and networks in interdependent ways. Within the network, there are multiple points of power. There are multiple leadership teams working interdependently with the goal of gospel saturation in a city, region, or country. Let’s review by comparing the two extreme ends of the continuum. In the next chapter we will take a look at the example of the early church for deeper insight. Is there someone in charge? Yes. Depends on hierarchy. One leader/board locally, often with another larger hierarchy denominationally. Pyramids with a few leaders at the top. No. Flat structure. Relies on influence rather than control. Multiplied leaders and leadership teams. Reproducing circles of leaders. Is there a headquarters? If you thump it on the head, will it die? Is there a clear division of roles? Yes. The church or faith community is strongly associated with one leader with centralized programs at a building. Church is an activity, building or eventSo, we, “Go to church.” Yes. Take out the lead pastor/board/boss and it dies, unless you quickly sow on a new head. Yes. Divided into centralized departments and programs with delineated staff and volunteer roles No. Location is flexible. Church is spread out in every domain of society making disciples, forming simple expressions of church that are connected with larger, more organized expressions of church, that work to make the Kingdom tangible. Church is an identitySo, we can only, “Be the Church.” No. If you take out the leaders, new leaders emerge because of reproducing disciples, leaders, teams and churches is normal. No. Anyone can do anything based on the development of character (fruit of the Spirit) and calling (gifts of for people to fill. There are slots to fill to help us run the centralized programs. Invite your friends to church so they can do the same. Reach and accumulate. the Spirit) in each person. The leaders equip everyone to discover their calling and develop their character. People are deployed into mission where they live, work, learn, and play, where they make disciples, form Kingdom initiatives, make disciples, see microchurches emerge, etc. Equip and Release. If you take out a unit, is the organization harmed? Are knowledge and power concentrated or distributed? Yes. Every department is necessary, especially the weekend services. Remove the weekend services and the church disperses. Centralized. Information and power are concentrated at the top with the lead pastor or lead team. No. The network can rebuild itself and is connected like cells in the Body. Even without weekly weekend services, the collective of disciples and smaller expressions of church keep reproducing. Decentralized. Information and power are dispersed throughout the network of reproducing disciples and churches. Is the organization flexible or rigid? Rigid. We have a lead pastor who fills the staff team, who runs the church. This structure will never change. Flexible. The organization is amorphous and fluid, leading to agility. Constantly growing, shrinking, mutating, spreading, dying, and rebirthing. New leadership teams are constantly emerging, who relate in dynamic ways to other leadership teams in the decentralized network of the church, filling a city or a region. Can you count it? Yes. Weekend attendance and church membership in a particular location or brand of church are fixed and can be counted. Not fully. Membership is fluid and open as disciples work together in networks and neighborhoods, even though they may connect with different congregations. Nobody is able to fully keep track of the discipling relationships, reproducing disciples, leaders, teams and churches in the city or regional network. How is it funded? Centrally funded. Offerings come to center and are distributed, with a priority on the center. Without funding, departments or programs quickly die. Self-Funding. A liberated financial model, where disciples, leaders, teams, and microchurches are responsible for sourcing and stewarding funds. We minimize the need for resources at the center, so the apostolic mission at the margins can be prioritized. How does communication work? From the top down, from the pastors through intermediaries. Important information is processed through HQ. The pastors are paid to be the experts endowed with special knowledge others are dependent on, who always have the answer. “All roads lead to Rome.” Every church has its own Pope. From the bottom up, directly between the disciples, leaders and churches in the network. The greatest learning happens at the edges, where discipleship and mission collide. Leaders facilitate collective intelligence by listening and reporting to the network. No roads lead to Rome, because there is no Rome. Jesus is the Pope for the Church. Blink Question #1: Which one, the Spider or the Starfish, best expresses the story of the church found in the book of Acts and the rest of the New Testament? Blink Question #2: Which one, the Spider or the Starfish, best expresses the story of the faith community you currently lead? Without a doubt, the early church is a story told at the Starfish end of the continuum. Most of us are charged to lead faith communities living at the Spider end of the continuum. A poverty of imagination causes us to keep trying Spider solutions for the challenges that we are up against. However, the challenges described in chapter 1 actually require a Starfish operating system to be solved. To begin, we must reimagine church through the original Starfish design Jesus gave it. We’ll explore that in the next chapter. Chapter 3 Reimagining the Church The starting point is theological, not structural or methodological. An institutional temple spirituality primarily oriented around church buildings, Sunday services, programs, formalized professional clergy, or standardized denominational frameworks, is not likely to produce a viral spiritual force of Christ followers and churches. Only a rigorous recovery of Christology--doctrine of Christ--will revitalize Christians. ~ Roger Helland, Magnificent Surrender But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. Acts 1:8 Let’s head back to Jerusalem to begin our theological reimagining of church. Her enemies said of the church, “…you have filled Jerusalem!13” Wouldn’t you love for that to be said about your faith movement in your city? “You have filled this city like water fills an aquarium. Everyone and everywhere is saturated!” In the context of this book, we are currently using the term Gospel Saturation to describe such an occurrence. What is Gospel saturation? The church owning the lostness of an identified people in a defined place ensuring that every man, woman, and child has repeated opportunities to see, hear, experience in community the Gospel, and then respond to the Good News of Jesus Christ. 14 Perhaps the most compelling expression of Gospel Saturation is Paul’s consummate vision for the Church and the entire Cosmos in Ephesians 1:22-23, And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way. How big are you when everything is under you little toe? How big is Jesus? Imagine the vastness of creation for a moment. Most of us were quarantined in a house for months during the COVID-19 pandemic. We could feel the walls closing in. So, let your imagination run wild and just envision again how vast the cosmos is. Jim Lovell, on the Apollo 8 mission said, “We went to learn about the moon, what I really discovered was how small the earth is15.” Another astronaut Jim Irwin describe the earth as a fragile ornament hanging in the blackness of space… he said, “As we pulled father away, eventually the earth was the size of a marble…”16 Pull back a little farther. February 14, 1990, as the Voyager 1 spacecraft left our planetary neighborhood for the fringes of the solar system, engineers turned it around for one last look at its home planet. Voyager 1 was about (4 billion miles away, and approximately 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane, when it captured a portrait of our world, now known affectionately as the Pale Blue Dot. Caught in the center of scattered light rays, Earth appears as
