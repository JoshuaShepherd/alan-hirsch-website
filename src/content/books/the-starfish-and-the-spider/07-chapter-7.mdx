---# Embracing Team-Based Leadership: Lessons from the Diffusion of Innovations

> *“Be subject ... to every fellow worker and laborer. Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.”*  
> —Ephesians 5:21

## The Diffusion of Innovations in Organizational Life

Everett Rogers' **Diffusion of Innovations** model identifies several key types of people within an organization:

- **Innovators** (3%): Possess a magnetic presence and an ability to influence. They are the early champions of new ideas and naturally attract other Innovators along with Rogers’ so-called Early Adopters.
- **Early Adopters** (13%): Recognize new ideas swiftly, assess them, and are the first to buy in.

When a new church is planted, it is typically Innovators and Early Adopters who get involved at the start. As growth continues, the next groups join:

- **Early Majority**
- **Late Majority**

Often, those with an innovative or apostolic gifting lack strong shepherding or pastoral skills. As the church grows, it needs the contribution of pastoral gifts, but frequently only has an apostle whose primary focus is dreaming of the next frontier. Many church plants plateau here, a challenge some organizational theorists call the **founder’s trap**.

### The Founder’s Trap

A common scenario is when the innovative leader becomes the default pastor, even if that is not where their gifts lie. Frequently, such leaders are unaware they’re filling a role that doesn't suit them—they simply want to help their community. Personal experience (Lance) confirms this: With a strong innovative bent but weak pastoral gifts, I found the “Senior Pastor” title set expectations I could not fulfill. Only as we brought on others with genuine pastoral skills did our church move beyond the stall point.

Churches that move past the founder’s trap often build a team that includes other essential roles (prophetic, evangelistic) as outlined in Ephesians 4:11-12:

> *“And he (Jesus) gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ.”*

## Moving Beyond Rank-Based Titles

We advocate moving away from status-centric titles in favor of **role-based titles** that clarify function, not hierarchy. Examples from organizations include:

- **HolacracyOne:** Uses “lead link” for department leaders, emphasizing connection and catalysis rather than rank. Fun, functional titles arise from actual job roles, such as “Social Media Butterfly” tasked to “Pollinate the web with Holacracy.”
- **Creative Role-Based Titles:**  
    - Apostles = Dream Awakeners  
    - Prophets = Heart Revealers  
    - Evangelists = Story Tellers  
    - Pastors = Soul Healers  
    - Teachers = Light Givers
- **Make-a-Wish Foundation:** Allowed team members to create their own titles, e.g., “Fairy Godmother of Wishes”, “Minister of Dollars and Sense”, “Duchess of Data”, and “Heralder of Happy News”.

Role-based titles reduce hierarchy and ambiguity—helping everyone know who does what, without status-driven descriptors like "Senior" or "Executive".

## The Wisdom of the Advice Process

Many organizations have adopted the **advice process** in decision-making. In this model, anyone can make a decision, but they must first seek advice from affected parties and those with expertise. This improves:

- The quality and speed of decisions
- Feelings of inclusion and value
- Peer-to-peer learning and accountability

As Dennis Bakke notes:

> *“The act of seeking advice is an act of humility. It draws those whose advice is sought into the proposition, sharing information, building community, and creating a sense of honor.”*

Unlike consensus (which can foster gridlock and dilute accountability), the advice process still leaves decision ownership with one person, enhancing both motivation and responsibility. As Frederic Laloux puts it:

> *“With the advice process, the ownership for the decision stays clearly with one person: the decision maker. While consensus drains energy out of organizations, the advice process boosts motivation and initiative.”*

## Practicing Mutual Submission in Leadership

Mutual submission is essential to healthy church leadership. Reflecting on a conversation with David Fitch (professor and founding pastor), he described how, as an apostolic leader, he regularly “submits ideas” to his team of Ephesians 4 elders, using language that emphasizes grace and humility. If the elders agree, the idea is prayed over before acting. If not, it remains with God until unity emerges. 

Fitch’s process, based on Matthew 18 and Acts 15, includes:

1. **Go directly (in humility), discuss, and listen.**
2. **If agreement isn’t reached, bring a third party as mediator.**
3. **For unresolved issues, bring the matter to the elders then the entire community for prayer and study.**

## Ensuring Every Voice Is Heard: Practical Steps

Steve Cockram (author, *Five Voices*) suggests the following approach to group discussions based on APEST profiles:

1. **Shepherds go first:**  
   - Representing 43% of organizations, they often avoid contradicting previous speakers.
   - Promise not to critique their input immediately.
2. **Prophets go next:**  
   - Invite risk-taking and outside-the-box thinking.
   - Ask clarifying questions, not judgments.
3. **Teachers go third:**  
   - Encourage difficult questions and thorough due diligence.
4. **Evangelists go fourth:**  
   - Let them sell the vision and build excitement. Don’t take critique personally.
5. **Apostles go last:**  
   - Listen patiently and provide a forward-looking, constructive critique.

This sequence not only ensures all perspectives are voiced, but also that more reserved contributors are not overshadowed by more assertive personalities.

## Collective Leadership: The Spirit-Driven Model

Relying on the concept of **pneumatocracy** (Spirit-led governance), leadership is grounded in the collective gifts and voices of the apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors, each exercising their role with grace and humility (Romans 12:3-4).

## Conflict Resolution: The Morning Star Example

At Morning Star, a large tomato processing company with no conventional management, conflict resolution mirrors Jesus’ model from Matthew 18:

1. **Direct conversation:** No gossip or backbiting; address issues directly.
2. **Bring a mediator:** If unresolved, involve a mutually trusted peer as facilitator—not as an arbiter.
3. **Panel review:** If still unresolved, a three-person panel seeks a solution. Only if deadlocked does the owner render a final decision.

This **accountability process** eliminates impulsive firings and creates space for the individual to find a role better suited to their gifts, mitigating fit issues within the organization.

## Fostering Humility and Equality: The Power of the Circle

Many organizational conflicts reflect aggressive, hierarchical dynamics. The **circle** restores equality—everyone is face-to-face; each voice matters. In this setting, participants answer:

- How does this issue relate to your personal experiences?
- How will the decision on this issue affect you moving forward?
- What outcome are you hoping for today?

The circle fosters active listening, curiosity, and collective wisdom. Key questions for evaluating the process include:

- Who is missing from this conversation?
- What insights have emerged?
- Have we been honest and open?
- Who are we right now?

This approach reflects the conviction that every human bears the *Imago Dei*—infused with God-given value and potential. When the body submits together to Christ’s leadership, remarkable things happen.

## Servant Leadership: The Model of Jesus

> *“In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
> Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant...”*  
> —Philippians 2:5-7

Jesus—Creator, Sustainer, Lord of all—shocked His disciples by washing their feet, a task relegated to the lowest of slaves. No precedent existed for a superior washing the feet of an inferior until Jesus set the example. 

> *“Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.”*  
> —John 13:14

**Service and generosity are not mere activities; they are our identity as followers of Jesus—a calling to servanthood in every area of life.**

## Our Offering

If possible, dear reader, we would wash your feet here and now, yet we know Jesus has already made that offering. This little book is our alabaster jar, broken at Jesus’ feet—our costly gift to Him, the fruit of our life’s work, offered for His pleasure.

> “May you, the Beloved of God, rediscover truths that ignite holy imagination. May you carry these lessons forward, unleashing the genius of God’s body, and see a wild, Spirit-led movement of reproducing disciples, leaders, and communities until God’s goodness runs free and unhindered!”
