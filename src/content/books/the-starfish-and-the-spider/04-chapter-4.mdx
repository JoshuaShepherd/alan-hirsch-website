---is their boss—it should guide all their actions on behalf of the company. And even beyond that—each and every commitment that they make and the colleagues to whom they make the commitment is their boss for that commitment.”68 Integrity is the single word definition Morning Star uses to sum up keeping commitments. It sounds very simplistic, but this means we do what we say we are going to do. Jesus said, “Let your yes mean yes and let your no mean no.”69 No Use of Force Against Other Persons There are certainly times command authority is needed. The recent Covid-19 epidemic crisis is a sterling example of the need for stay-at-home directives from national and local authorities in order to starve the flu virus of human hosts. But when life is going as it should be commanding others doesn’t work in a free society. Even family members don’t respond well to being ordered around. No one person at Morning Star has unilateral authority to fire anyone. This does not mean that people are not fired. It is how they are dismissed that is different. We will get to the dismissal process later. As we have said earlier, leadership is an issue of power. Supervisors and superiors have power over others. When we eliminate the rank and title of superiors, we take away the command authority of one person ordering another person what to do. If a member senses certain actions or attitudes of a fellow worker is in conflict with the overall mission, she is obligated to speak directly to the other person concerning the matter. Placing supreme value on communication at the micro level can often circumvent larger crisis or conflict. Sometimes simple miscommunication or mere assumption leads to perceptions that are wrong. Seeking and speaking the truth in love is the way of the Spirit of God and should be a guiding rule for our organizations as well as personal lives. Ori underscores a vital principle of decentralization in The Starfish and The Spider, “An open system doesn’t have central intelligence; the intelligence is spread throughout the system. Information and knowledge naturally filter in at the edges, closer to where the action is.”70 If we value freedom, we will value the sharing of truth. Systemically this means we commit to installing a truth system. Truth systems are organically open systems. Such systems are a requirement for life and renewal. For instance, the human body shares information freely. The brain doesn’t withhold information from the little toe. For a living system such as a church—the body of Christ—when information stops formation stops. And when formation ceases healthy life begins to seize up. IN + Formation = continually forming or developing The way information flows reveals everything about command and control or freedom and release in an organization. In top-down organizations top people decide what lower level people are privy to and when they are allowed to receive privileged information. The conjecture is that employees are only marginally trusted. Organics come into play in control-based organizations. Where you sow distrust, you reap distrust. The atmosphere of such associations is occupied with suspicion and distrust. In self-managed churches and business everyone is a VIP! Information is free to be accessed by everyone. This means financials are available in every sphere of the organization. Frederic Laloux speaks to the importance of such open policies In the absence of hierarchy, self-managing teams need to have all available information to make the best decisions. Any information that isn’t public will cause suspicion (why else would someone go through the trouble to keep it secret?), and suspicion is toxic for organizational trust. Informal hierarchies reemerge when some people are in the know while others are not.71 Carefully consider the word communication. The root of it is commune—which includes community and cooperative. In a genuine community communication is a two-way street. People are not talked down to because no one is above another. Anyone is welcomed to ask anything about any issue. But I also want you to think about how this keeps your significance from getting blown up into selfimportance. For no matter how significant you are, it is only because of what you are a part of. An enormous eye or a gigantic hand wouldn’t be a body, but a monster. What we have is one body with many parts, each its proper size and in its proper place. No part is important on its own. Can you imagine Eye telling Hand, “Get lost; I don’t need you”? Or, Head telling Foot, “You’re fired; your job has been phased out”? As a matter of fact, in practice it works the other way—the “lower” the part, the more basic, and therefore necessary. You can live without an eye, for instance, but not without a stomach. When it’s a part of your own body you are concerned with, it makes no difference whether the part is visible or clothed, higher or lower. You give it dignity and honor just as it is, without comparisons. If anything, you have more concern for the lower parts than the higher. If you had to choose, wouldn’t you prefer good digestion to full-bodied hair? The way God designed our bodies is a model for understanding our lives together as a church: every part dependent on every other part, the parts we mention and the parts we don’t, the parts we see and the parts we don’t. If one-part hurts, every other part is involved in the hurt, and in the healing. If one-part flourishes, every other part enters into the exuberance. You are Christ’s body—that’s who you are! You must never forget this. Only as you accept your part of that body does your “part” mean anything. 1 Corinthians 12:18-31 The Message If we suppress the gifts of any member, we suppress the Spirit of God working through the gifts, talents, wisdom, and experience of those same people. But when we open the floodgates of information flow and decision-making, we expose the entire organization to the Spirit’s treasure trove of innovation and creativity. It all rests on the free flow of information and the freedom for all team members to be able to speak openly and honestly to one another without fear or threat of retribution. Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. 15:14 NKJV The language of the New Testament is that the church is a family. The Apostle Paul says he is assured that the body of Christ is capable of carrying out the task of admonishing one another. Remember, the letter to the Romans was not addressed to elders, senior leaders, or a board or committee. The apostle does not say, “You need senior staff to admonish the workers.” He places the responsibility of warning and exhorting one another squarely upon the shoulders of the collective community of believers. This raises the bar on expectations of maturity for the “normal” everyday saint. The letter to the Romans was written to the priesthood of believers, the community of saints (Romans 1:7). This is an issue of competency and the Holy Spirit is saying the people who are filled with the Spirit of God are very much capable of holding one another accountable. Doug Kirkpatrick’s book is titled Beyond Empowerment because he believes “Employee empowerment implies that one person is transferring power to another person. In the real world, what is given can be taken away. In self-management, colleagues already have all the power they need to make anything happen they want to have happen from the moment they start work. Self-management is beyond empowerment. Self-management is power itself.”72 Leaders do not empower followers. Rather, leaders create the systemic freedom and cultural conditions for the entire community to exercise their gifts and abilities. The community as a whole has the frontline responsibility for social order and group harmony. Throughout the epistles, verse after verse underscores the responsibility of the brothers and sisters, the servantship community, to rebuke when necessary and edify at all times. Below are but a sampling of such passages: •Honor one another (Romans 12:10) •Build up one another (Romans 14:19; 1 Thess. 5:11; Heb. 3:13; 10:25) •Warn and exhort one another (Romans 15:14; Col. 3:16) •Provide discipline among yourselves (1 Cor. 5:3-5) •Bear one another’s overwhelming burdens (Gal. 5:13; 6:2) •Submit to one another (Eph. 5:21) •Teach one another (Col. 3:16) •Incite one another to “love and good works” (Heb.10:24) •Confess sins to one another (James 5:16) Church discipline has been categorized as a leadership function and duty. The scripture says otherwise. It is not to be carried out by a hierarchical few. It is the responsibility of everyday saints, normal people with the Spirit of God in them. Siblings throughout the faith community are called to be accountable to and for one another. This certainly applies to everyone that works in your church staff or faith-based organization of business.73 Mutual oversight is the theme of the New Testament. Hierarchy is not only absent from the narratives of Jesus and the epistles, it is forbidden. This is not to say that people do not have responsibilities they must answer for. But no place do we find the idea of a boss/employee arrangement in the New Testament. What we do see is a commitment to self-discipline, accountability to the group as a whole, and personal responsibility. In Leadership on The Other Side, author and church growth expert Bill Easum shares three essential characteristics for the sustainability of a culture of servant disciples practicing mutual accountability and oversight: •Competency: Those who function as a team must be able to count on the other members of the team to do what they say they will do. •Consistency: They have to be able to count on the other team members to be there for them. •Integrity: They have to be able to take team members at their word. Responsibly mature disciples are servants who are faithful and need not be evaluated by a centralized office of command and control. Systems of self-management are only sustainable in cultures of high collegiality. Team members consistently submit themselves to other members, maintaining a humble posture that invites forthright critique on an ongoing basis from their peers while keeping in mind several questions: •Am I stewarding the resources I have been entrusted with integrity? •Is there pride in me that’s keeping me from soliciting advice from others around me? •Am I being faithful (giving my best) to my calling? •Is there someone here who could do what I’m doing better than I can? # Management SELF-MANAGEMENT Limited access to leaders Open access to anyone Information guarded No limits on information Goals set by higher ups Goals set by individuals and teams Limited accountability (to bosses) Mutual accountability (to all) Power loaned out Power acknowledged and permitted In conclusion, we are now at a pivotal moment in our journey. The Movement Starfish gives us a definition for church as movement that is inspiring, yet grounded; magnificent, yet measurable in five points of multiplication; Spirited-empowered, and also strategic. We begin with that end in mind. The next three Starfish, the Light Load Leader, Structure and Self-Management Starfish, create the right leadership culture for the vision of the Movement Starfish to rise from. But, the real test of leadership, in our opinion, is that of discipleship. Although, we started with leadership culture, leadership culture actual flows out of and builds on a disciple-making culture. In essence, these are two sides of the same coin. In the pursuit of the Movement Starfish, everything rises and falls on our ability to make disciples who make disciples, what we are calling reproducing owners of the faith. If a healthy multiplicative, transformative disciple-making culture is in place, a healthy multiplicative leadership culture naturally begins to arise. If both of the environments – disciple-making and leadership development are healthy, you’ll end up producing healthy microchurches, healthy hubs, and healthy networks, as well. Disciple-making and leadership development are the basic building blocks of all those larger expressions. As you’ll see, it’s that same fractal that is reproduced, all the way up into the larger expressions like Hubs and Networks. Now, we begin our journey into then, what we believe are the two most critical Starfish because they help us define and cultivate disciple-making environments and ecosystems. # Section Three A Culture Chapter 7 The Owner-Making Ingredient Starfish You can do more with twelve disciples than you can do with twelve hundred religious consumers. –Alan Hirsch Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” Matthew 18:18-20. “From Mexico to Alaska, there has been a massive die off of starfish, estimates are in the tens of millions. This is one of the largest mortality events…ever observed in the ocean,” states Ben Miner, Associate Professor in Marine and Estuarine Program of Western Washington University. Since 2013, a disease has caused starfish to die in record-breaking numbers up and down the U.S. west coast. Scientist haven’t been able to find a “smoking gun,” and aren’t sure what causes the disease. 74 The syndrome known as sea star wasting disease (SSWS) causes starfish to lose limbs and eventually disintegrate, leaving behind the tell-tale sign of the disease, a pile of white goo. Miner continues, “One of the greatest threats in a massive die-off is that all the adults, which are the only starfish capable of reproduction, are gone. Which means no new babies.” 75 Many faith communities in the West are experiencing a similar crisis: a massive fallout of engaged, reproducing owners of the faith. The Humanist states, “We’re reaching the end of the alphabet – and the end of a religious statistical oddity in the United States. Generation Z, more so than the preceding Generation…is demonstrating a telling and permanent downtrend in religious identity.”76 The emptying of organized faith communities is a real phenomenon. Scott Thumma, director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research predicts, “In the next twenty years, you’ll have half as many open congregations as now.”77 In 2017, the Public Religion Research Institute reported a dramatic, rapidly increasing decline that is easy to see when making comparisons over time. 78 In 1986, for example, 10 percent of young adults gave the answer “none” to a PRRI survey asking their religion. In the 2016 that figure had shot up to 39 percent. When you pull back the camera lens to include all generations, you discover what may be the most consequential shift in America’s spiritual landscape, the rise of the religiously unaffiliated. This trend emerged in the early 1990’s, when only six percent of Americans identified their religious affiliation as “None.” Today, one-quarter of Americans claim no formal religious identity, making this group the largest “religious group” in the US. Furthermore, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing at the time of this writing, with churches unable to gather, without a doubt, there will be a culling of congregations who simple won’t be viable post-pandemic. If the goal of every faith community is a starfish, the spontaneous reproduction of faith-filled, flourishing, owners of the faith, then we are in a crisis. A good news needle is hidden in this data haystack, however. When one digs deeper, the rise of the “Nones” is not attributable to a decline in the percentage of people who express spiritual and religious enthusiasm, which according to 2018 General Social Survey at the University of Chicago is 34 percent, a number which has remained unchanged over the 30 years.79 Who are the folks who are converting to the “Nones”? The Unengaged Middle. In American faith, we see the same trend that has been growing in the political and economic realms, the middle is dropping out, with sides forming at each end of the continuum. According to the GSS surveyors, it is the faith affiliation group entitled, “Somewhat Strong,” where the significant drop off is occurring. These are the folks in our faith communities who are neither fully 76 https://thehumanist.com/magazine/september-october-2018/features/faith-and-faithlessness-by-generation-the-decline-and-rise-are-real 77 https://thehumanist.com/magazine/september-october-2018/features/faith-and-faithlessness-by-generation-the-decline-and-rise-are-real 78 https://www.prri.org/research/prri-rns-poll-nones-atheist-leaving-religion/ engaged or fully disengaged. As a faith leader, it’s likely your thinking, “Most of my people fit in that category.” Realize this means the rise in “Nones” has nothing to do with the intrinsic power of faith to transform and bring meaning to a person’s life. The rise in “Nones” is not about a general societal decline in spiritual or religious fervor. The rise in Nones is about a lack of meaningful engagement, a lack of personal ownership and a loss of faith identity within those already within our faith communities. Therein lies the good news. A Starfish movement in our faith community can begin by reengaging and activating those already within the influence of our faith communities. Within the prevailing model, the congregation becomes the fishing pond from which one can identify and then invite others into an intentional owner-making experience. Or for those who are more missionally engage, the new owners of the faith, emerge from the Harvest field. In the great DDM’s and CPM’s around the world, most of the mobilization is from the Harvest. But here in America, we also need to mobilize from the Church toward the Harvest. Either way, if we don’t help folks experience the flourishing life and transformation of faith, if they don’t become radical owners of their faith, not only will it not be reproduced in the lives of others, they will continue leaving in record numbers. Why? The larger cultural expectations for engagement in a faith community have disappeared. Fifty years ago, it was expected that one would go to church on Sunday. That day is gone. Without the outside social pressure to engage a church, that means faith leaders must develop a culture within their faith communities that catalyze internal motivation and personal ownership within people. Or it means missional engagement with the spiritual curious, then immediately upon and even preceding their conversion, we are developing immediate ownership and reproduction practices. If we learn to create the right environments, Intentional Owner-Making Environments, the power of the Starfish can be awakened! The starfish faith community rises and falls on its ability to make personal transformed owners of the faith, who can in turn influence others, lovingly and relationally, to experience the same transformation and ownership deep in their souls. What does it look like when the Unengaged Middle becomes Transformed, Reproducing Owners of Faith? Take a look at this whiteboard drawing. Behind it is a story of those in “The Unengaged Middle,” who were awakened to become radical, reproducing owners of their faith. When we say radical, we must clarify. We live in a world, where religious radicals are committing unbelievable atrocities every day in the name of God. Understandably, we are leery of any conversation where the idea of radical is intersected with idea of religion. When, we use this word, however, we are referring to its most ancient meaning. Radical was formed from the Latin adjective radicalis, which simply meant "of or relating to a root." How do we get to simpler, more elemental expression of the faith? The folks in the following story found themselves stepping out of unengaged religious consumption into a more radical experience of transforming faith. This is a story that has been unfolding in Kansas City for eight years. What started with Brian Phipps, a frustrated pastor, has become a disciple-making movement with disciples reproducing to the fourth generation and beyond, on multiple strands. Disciple is the term Jesus used to describe what we are calling reproducing owners of the faith. Whether you are reading this as a church leader, business leader, or leader of any societal organization, we have a shared goal of seeing others own the mission of our organization and reproduce other owners of the mission. Brian is also one of my best friends and the originator of the first iteration of what he called the Intentional Disciple-Making Environment. Through our shared work, we have now expanded to what you will read in the next six chapters. In his own words, “Eight years ago, here I was a pastor, the paid professional holding two master’s degrees, having attended over fifty leadership conferences, and having consumed endless books and articles on discipleship. Yet it had slowly dawned on me, I had never personally multiplied disciples. Yes, I had led many small groups and discipleship programs, but the results were discouraging and not reproductive. That was very hard to accept, but it created a humble posture of learning inside of me.” He goes on, “I did not know what to do differently than what I had done before. I did the only thing I knew how to do. I repented. With a new humility and earnestness, I committed to obey whatever Jesus asked of me, if he would guide me step by step. The first thing he told me was to put an end date on my current men’s small group. I had to QUIT discipling people that were not interested in discipling others. With excitement, I explained the end date of the group and I shared this vision of becoming disciplemakers. It went over like a lead balloon. Some of the guys were offended that I was ending their group. The rest of the guys didn’t think they were up to the task. Disciple-making…isn’t that for the religious professionals? Here’s what I told them, “I will personally disciple them for one year in order to help them become disciples who can make disciples.” Sounds simple, right? Well, I did not even know which ones to invite! I simply prayed for a few weeks for Jesus to show me His choices. He did. Clearly. Of the original group, five of those guys committed to going on the journey to become disciple-makers. Each of those men invited an apprentice to join them. In so doing, Jesus had already led me to move from a twogeneration disciple-making model to a three-generation model.” Ken was one of those five guys that Brian discipled into disciple-making. At that point, Ken’s marriage had just taken a significant hit when his wife discovered pornography on his computer. During that year of developing character and calling with Brian, Ken’s marriage was restored, and his family was transformed. In the last eight years, Ken has made disciples who have made disciples who have made disciples who have made disciples. It literally totals hundreds of people in that “strand” from Brian to Ken downstream four generations and beyond. Jim, at the beginning of the journey, was depressed and drinking too much. Over the year, Jim broke his addiction by finding what he truly needed in Jesus and has more than 50 disciples downstream in his disciple-making chain reaction. One of Jim’s disciple-making beneficiaries is a pastor in our area who was in crisis. This leader did not have healthy accountability and was starting to engage in an emotional affair. Jim, “the lay person,” discipled “the pastor” in developing his character and calling, which completely redirect his life and saved his marriage. Now, that pastor is multiplying disciples through his church. Brian concludes, “I have personally discipled over 120 people in these last eight years. Over 30% of them have taken up the vision of being disciples who make disciples.” That may not feel like a great return on investment…only 30%. But, Starfish movements “slow is the new fast.” You can’t microwave reproducing, transformed owners of the faith. You could say we develop owners in a crockpot, slow cooking over time. Investing in small numbers of people over time has always been the way of Starfish movements. If spectators become owners who can create other owners, eventually multiplication kicks in. Consider Brian’s words carefully, “That 30% have similar stories to mine, in their wake. The map you see on that white board, which I drew in 2015, conservatively represents more than 2,500 people who are experiencing transformation in their character and feel a deep sense of personal calling. That story began in 2010 with me and the original five owners, working out at only a 20% success rate over five years. Due to the speed up of exponential multiplication, which is now working in our favor, that number has jumped from 2500 to 4,000 in the last two and 1/2 years!” You’re probably wondering, what is going on underneath the surface in these stories? How does that happen? What are the ingredients needed to fuel this kind of transformation and multiplication among ordinary people? How do I, as a faith leader, intentionally create disciple-making environments of faith? We’ve adopted the language of “owner-making “ to open up the aperture for those readers who are from different sectors, outside of the religious sector, to better conceive that these principles do apply to your setting. Over the next five chapters, we will explore the key ingredients for what we call an Intentional OwnerMaking Environment (henceforth, IOE). An IOE contains the five essential ingredients to create transformative and multiplicative ownership of the faith. Again, it is our conviction, that these elements, although translated differently, are essential for reproducing owners of the mission in other sectors of society, as well. THE OWNER-MAKING INGREDIENTS STARFISH Ingredient #1: Outcome-Focused: The Key Questions: How clearly can we articulate the outcomes of internal transformation? To what degree is the goal of our faith community the experience of personal transformation into the likeness of God? To what degree are people in our faith community discovering and living into their personal calling? Ingredient #2: Habit-Fueled: The Key Questions: How effectively do we help people develop personally meaningful spiritual habits? How effectively do we help people develop sacred rhythms that feed their mind and souls? Do we have experiential and relational pathways that make the development of faith habits normal? Ingredient #3: Community-Forged: The Key Questions: Do we understand and engage all five spheres of community required for human flourishing? How well do we help people creating overlapping social spaces that deepen their engagement in our faith community? How well do we move people out of the privatized individualism trend into deep, meaningful faith community engagement? Ingredient #4: Mission-Fixated: The Key Questions: How well do help each person discover that the mission of faith involves the everyday spaces where we live, work, learn and play? How well do help each person own the mission personally? What resources, process, and tools do we provide to empower each person to own, apply, and innovate mission? Ingredient #5: Content-Flavored: The Key Questions: Do we have clarity on what the fractal of our faith is? What is our irreducible minimum? How well do we pass on this fractal of faith in way that is generous and inclusive? Is this passed on in way that moves beyond intellectual assent to integration into all of life? Before we examine the ingredients of an IOE, let’s remember owner-making isn’t a microwave-activity, it’s a crockpot-lifestyle. Flashback to the eighties. I remember the day we got our microwave, that came with the much-hyped, space age promise of time saving efficiency. Food will be ready in a flash, Gordon! Right away, I was ready to strap on my space suit and take off. First, I took a hotdog, placed it in a bun, and nuked it for a couple minutes. MMMMM, that bun was as hard as cardboard. Not to be discouraged, I moved quickly to scrambled eggs next and ended up with a rubberized omelet. Delish! The only upside that day was when I discovered that marshmallows blow up when microwaved. My Mom, who was a home-economics major in college, never took to the microwave, beyond making popcorn. She preferred slow cooking. Many a day, the crock-pot was the instrument of choice. One of her classic meals was porcupines. The imagery might not sound too appetizing but trust me they were the pièce de résistance. Porcupines are meatballs embedded with rice, marinated in an Italian herbs and tomato sauce. She’d tuck those meatballs in the sauce, stick the crockpot on low, and let them simmer all day. Oh, the whole house was filled with the most delicious aroma! My stomach is grumbling now as I think about it. Slow cooking those meatballs in the crock-pot made them so tender, allowing the sauce to soak entirely through the meatball, saturating every last bite with such flavor. Jump forward a few decades. After a tumble down the stairs, post-surgery my wife was bed-ridden for six weeks. We still had three kids to feed daily, as well as, some neighborhood children to feed on a regular basis, as that was a part of our family rhythm as “missionaries” in our neighborhood. Overnight, I was commissioned with all the cooking duties. In an effort to be efficient, I became the “Commander of the Crockpot.” With a little advanced planning, I could get the ingredients in the crockpot early morning before work, let it simmer all day, come home after work, and offer up a homemade masterpiece for the family and neighbors. Eventually, we figured out the go-to meals for rotation. I had no advanced culinary degrees. I didn’t need to be a five-star Michelin chef. The best crock recipes were ones that friends shared with me. One of them even had a database of such recipes! It didn’t take a ton of food preparation to get a meal together. We had some great meals to share! My wife will even brag on my cooking now. But, it’s not that impressive. Really, virtually anyone can become the master of the crockpot. Disciple-making isn’t about being the expert. It’s about learning and adding back in the basic key ingredients any cook can find, which the people of God have known and practiced for centuries. It doesn’t require an advanced degree, lots of complex preparation, or complicated skills. You can’t microwave disciples. It takes time, accountability, community, consistency and practice. As the key ingredients simmer inside those containers, faith-owners are tenderized and transformed by the Spirit. Soon they themselves are ready to share the meal and show others how to make the meal. The culmination of history, as pictured in the book of Revelation is seen as the Wedding Feast of the Lamb (Revelation 19:6-9). People from every tribe will be gathered to celebrate the great Union of God and humanity. These are the people who have come to own the mission of Jesus to heal, redeem and restore all things. The authors love to think of millions of people personally owning the mission of universal flourishing, which we believe transcends any one particular faith tradition or denomination. By the way, I’m positive my Mom’s porcupines will be on the menu at the Wedding Feast! Let’s now take a look at each of the ingredients we want to put into the crockpot. Chapter 8 Outcome-Focused Owner-Making Environment Ingredient #1 You’ve heard it said, “Begin with the end in mind.” Too often, the desired outcome of most discipleship programs is what I call the “data dump.” If we can just open up the top of people skulls and poor enough good content, mission accomplished. You’ve been “discipled.” The outcome of discipleship, however, isn’t simply a transfer of information. The goal is transformation by incarnation. The word becomes flesh and blood in the lives of Jesus followers, disciples. Sheldon Vanuaken proclaims, in his classic book A Severe Mercy, “The best argument for Christianity is Christians: their joy, their certainty, their completeness. But the strongest argument against Christianity is also Christians--when they are somber and joyless, when they are self-righteous and smug in complacent consecration, when they are narrow and repressive, then Christianity dies a thousand deaths.” Sheldon is reminding those of us from the Christian tradition, that Jesus’ plan was not to start a movement full of people who call themselves Jesus’ disciples, but remain cranky, prideful, judgmental, dishonest, selfish, lustful, self-righteous, and religious until they die and go to heaven. His plan was to begin a movement of the transformed heart. To recreate men and women who are radiantly loving at the core. The Apostle Paul describes it this way, For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son. Romans 8:29 For a Christian, the outcome of true faith-ownership is this: I become like Jesus in my character, within the very essence of my being. We consider this our highest calling. Similarly, the ultimate goal of all mature spirituality, within healthy expressions of the Abrahamic religions, at least, is to reflect the image of God. Humanity’s transformation into the likeness of God is the ultimate goal. Wisdom from each of these Abrahamic traditions can converge to give us clarity on the true outcome of transformative faith. Philosopher Ken Wilber, articulates this goal when he describes what he sees as the two transcendent shared outcomes of religion, ... Religion itself has always performed two very important, but very different functions. One, it acts as a way of creating meaning for the separate self: it offers myths and stories and tales and narratives and rituals that, taken together, help the separate self-make sense of, and endure, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. This function of religion does not usually or necessarily change the level of consciousness in a person; it does not deliver radical transformation.” But two, religion has also served—in a usually very, very small minority—the function of radical transformation and liberation. This function of religion does not fortify the separate self, but utterly shatters it—not consolation but devastation, not entrenchment but emptiness, not complacency but explosion, not comfort but revolution—in short, not a conventional bolstering of consciousness but a radical transmutation and transformation at the deepest seat of consciousness itself.80 Faith leaders often settle for the first outcome of faith, which is usually a sense of meaning and comfort. However, true disciple-making requires people aspire to the outcome of radical transformation. This outcome moves people beyond ego-centric goals of comfort and security toward the greater heights of transformation, which manifests itself in a transformed life. That is why Jesus said, “Blessed are the poor in spirit (Matt 5:3).” Recognizing our own poverty and brokenness is the beginning of transformation. The greatest disciple-making movements globally, have always sparked most easily among marginalized people groups, simply because they are already “blessed” with a deep awareness that “something has to change!” The “poor” are vastly more selfaware than “rich,” who have been lulled asleep by affluence, success, and comfort. Periodically, an event like the COVID-19 pandemic or 9/11, will shake millions of people simultaneously from their spiritual slumber. Usually, however, it is the everyday experience of pain, loss, defeat, failure, bankruptcy, addition, and the like that prepare us for transformation in our character. We feel the gap between who we are and who we want to be. Then, we realize, “I need to change.” This is where the hope of the first outcome comes in. Outcome #1: Character What does this God-like character look like? In other words, what is this God like? Thomas Keating states, “The chief fruit of Old Testament spirituality was a long-term education that gradually weaned the Chosen People away from their narrow concept of God as one among many other Near Eastern gods to the Transcendent One. The monotheistic God is the great gift of Israel to humanity.”81 Unlike the fickle and cruel pantheon of tribal gods the ancient world and archaic religion sought to appease, this God described himself to Moses this way: The Lord passed before him, and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for the thousandth generation,[a] forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin. Exodus 34:6-7 (NRSV) This became the faith fractal that Israel used to summarize the character of God. Five marvelous dimensions that describe the core of what we can become: Merciful (in Hebrew, rhm), Compassionate/Gracious (hnn), Steadfast and Unconditional in Love (hsd), Relentlessly Faithful (‘emeth) and Forgiving (ns’). Building upon this Old Testament foundation, the apostle Paul in the New Testament provides another portrait of this character in full bloom, with what he calls The Fruit of the Spirit: …the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things. Galatians 5:22-23 (NRSV) Notice Paul does not say the traits of the Spirit, the components parts of the Spirit, the aspects of the Spirit. He says, “The fruit of the Spirit.” How does this fruit grow? In the New Testament, the guiding metaphors are organic. In our time, the guiding metaphors are mechanical. On this side of the industrial revolution, we manufacture things. That metaphor dominates the way we think about change. Think of how many times you’ve said things like, “I’ve got to make this happen.” This is profoundly important as it applies to developing the fruit of the Spirit. Paul uses the word fruit deliberately because he is invoking a metaphor of botanical growth. That speaks not only to the product of change, but the process of change. This type of internal, spiritual transformation is not simply manmade. The difference between mechanical and organic change is the difference between striving and yielding. You can restrain your character temporarily through striving, like squeezing a nerf ball to a smaller size. But you didn’t really change it, you just restrained it, and then as soon as you let the pressure off, it snaps back. That’s standard operating procedure, “I will STRIVE and MAKE the change happen.” But then my will power runs out and then, my character “SNAPS!” back. All you get from striving is a morally restrained heart, not a spiritually transformed heart. Striving for a morally restrained heart is like eating manufactured wax fruit rather than feasting on fresh organic fruit. They may look the same on the outside from a distance, but they sure taste different. Instead of the striving-experience of “squeeze and snapback” which leads to frustration, we can discover the yielding-experience of “remain and respond” which leads to transformation. We find this power source in the Spirit, which makes the person of God in Jesus Christ, fully available to all those who believe. “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.” John 15:5 (NIV) Remain in me. In other words, stay in the Spirit, walk with Spirit, and spend your day aware that the Spirit is available to you. If you do, the fruit of radical, internal transformation – mercy, compassion, love, joy, faithfulness, wisdom, patience, kindness, goodness – will slowly grow in us. Think of how it is that fruit grows in nature. There are forces that the plant can simply open up and receive: sunlight, water, and oxygen. No one has ever heard an apple tree in an orchard grunting with effort to produce fruit. Transformation begins with receiving what the Spirit is giving. Also, respond to me. For a truly productive harvest to be realized, a gardener must also learn to respond or cooperate with these forces by mindfully engaging age-old practices that are essential. One must learn to tend the garden and weed out that which threatens the slow-growing harvest. When it comes to experiencing radical transformation in our character, we remain by first trusting that God is gracious. The Spirit will provide the light and oxygen our souls need to grow. Secondly, we remain by practicing the ancient habits of soul gardening that keep us connected to the Spirit. As we “remain,” the Spirit will guide us and prompt us to new action or explorations of new avenues, then we respond with engagement and obedience to that prompting. Along the way, we are transformed in character, which is the first essential outcome we must focus on. Additionally, along the way, that responsive life leads to a discovery in calling, which is the second outcome focus. Outcome #2: Calling Whereas character involves our becoming, our calling involves our doing. We are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. Ephesians 2:10 According to Ephesians 2, every follower of Jesus receives a sacred summons, what is commonly referred to as a calling. However, this term has been used almost exclusively for pastors, missionaries, or other leaders in vocational ministry. This tragedy has not simply squelched the potential impact of the church in America… is has put it in a chokehold. It is time for every person to pursue, locate, and make the highest possible impact through their personal calling. I believe Jesus has called every follower of Jesus in a unique way that would meet every need in every community if they would only have a way to locate that personal calling. Do you see how much is riding on this? As meaningful as volunteering can be inside the programs of the centralized church, ultimately God’s vision is to fill everything in every way with all that Jesus is (Ephesians 1:22-23). In Ephesians 1:22-23, Paul declares, “And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.” Paul says that Jesus is filling everything every way. He is big enough to fill every need, big enough to be the solution to every problem, big enough to redeem every mistake, big enough to restore everything broken. This is God’s Master Mission to fill everything every way with all that He is. What would that even look like? Saturation. Imagine the city you live in like an aquarium. Think of water filling an aquarium, completely surrounding and engulfing every object within the tank, including the rocks, the coral, and the artificial castle; 100 percent of the available surface area saturated by the water. What would it be like for your whole city to be saturated with the beauty, justice, and good news of Jesus, nothing untouched, everything submerged? God wants to see all of your city, every corner of culture, saturated with all that He is: Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, etc. Is that the kind of city you want to live in? Where there is isolation, we bring community, because our God is divine community. Where there is poverty, we bring abundance, because our God is the God of abundance. Where this is violence, we bring peace-making, because our God is peace. Where there is racism or misogyny, we bring equality and dignity because God’s image is stamped on every single one of us. Where there is disease, we bring healing because our God is a healer. How will He do that? Through us. In Ephesians, we are described as “his body, the fullness of him.” We are invited to be his body, his hands and feet in action on the ground. We are invited to be the fullness of him, making that fullness tangible where we live, work, learn, and play. In other words, God’s people have been mobilized to fill every corner of culture for the purpose of making the love, joy, beauty and shalom of God tangible there. Discovering and living into your personal calling is the way you find your part in that Masterpiece. Each of us has a one of a kind Masterpiece Mission. As we each discover and live into it, alongside others, those mosaics make up the Masterpiece, the fullness grows with each person who discovers and lives out their calling. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Every time a person is unaware or unengaged in their Masterpiece Mission, the tank is emptied of that part of the fullness. Individually, without knowing our personal calling, we feel “empty,” lacking purpose, significance, and meaning. Corporately, our faith communities, cities and world feel “empty,” lacking the fullness that God intends to fill up the needs and emptiness that vex and oppress us. There are two types of people in the world: Those who knowimagetheir masterpiece mission and those who do not. Most people settle for life in the second category, which contributes to an aching sense of purposelessness. No wonder we see so little effect in our culture. Currently, many churches do have a process to activate volunteers into programs. As helpful as that is, it doesn’t not address the larger purpose of every owner of the faith knowing their unique personal calling. Volunteering is a good beginning, but it is not the endzone. It’s time for every faith community to have a personal calling discovery and deployment process. That discovery process may begin with volunteering within the programs of a faith community but will ultimately emphasize the endzone of engagement in personal calling where you live, work, learn, and play. When that happens, our faith communities cease to be cul-de-sac congregations and start operating like the Hubs in Jerusalem or Ephesus, launching people and communities out on mission, all over our city and region. Helping ordinary folks discover and then be deployed into their calling is essential to intentional ownermaking environments. There are many ways to do gift assessment and calling discovery. Here in our movement in Kansas City we have created a calling discovery and development process. We call it GPS. With the invention of the Global Positioning System, navigation has been revolutionized. The signals from the satellites triangulate your exact position and then can provide clarity on how to get to your destination. Wouldn’t it be great if there was a GPS for the soul? What if there was a spiritual technology that could help you locate your unique calling? There is. We want every disciple to learn about the God-given “soul-technology” of GPS – their gifts, passions, and story. Our calling is primarily expressed as we discover, develop, and deploy our Gifts in our area of Passion as we allow Jesus to write our Story. We are all born with natural gifts. These natural gifts are the product of God’s common grace given to all people. One of the aspects included in common grace is the set of natural gifts and talents we were born with (Psalm 139:13-16, Genesis 1:27, James 1:27). Our natural abilities come with an invitation to co-create with God, “fill the earth and subdue it,” so there will be order and flourishing in the world. For those who have received amazing grace, we also have received spiritual gifts that we are given at our second birth. Our natural abilities can create wonderful things, but it is through our spiritual gifts that we discover a divine power to make disciples, strengthen the Church for her mission, fight demonic evil, and fully manifest the Kingdom in healing and power. Through the Holy Spirit and our spiritual gifts, God empowers his church to bless the world at large. Through our natural gifts we join God as cocreators in make culture and society a place of universal flourishing for all people. “It was He who ‘gave gifts to men’...to build up the Body of Christ so we shall all come together to that oneness in our faith...and become mature...Then we shall no longer be children, carried by the waves and blown about by every shifting wind... Eph. 4:11, 13-14 (GN) As we discover our God-assigned passions, we will begin to shift from a sense of feeling lost to gaining direction about our place in life. While our gifts outline some of that direction, when we add in an understanding of our passions we begin to tap into the power-source that internally motivates us to pursue our calling. Gifts shows us what we can do, our passions show us where and with whom we should use our gifts. Our passion involves a blending of passion for certain groups of people, certain causes, and the particular motivation (Ephesians 4:11-12) that fuels us as we look at the world. “Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.” Ps. 37:4 Paul says that you and I are living letters being written by the Spirit of God. Your story isn’t just a list of facts and events. It’s a weaving of those facts and events into a narrative that has meaning, one that connects with God’s larger story. There is an arc to your story. Do you know how to read it? There are primary themes to your story. Are you aware of them? That arc and those themes will lead you to discover your calling. Turn in the signals of your Gifts, Passions, and Story, you will be on your pathway of personal calling. You can discover more about GPS in a book I (Rob) cowrote with Brian Phipps called Find Your Place: Locating Your Calling Through Gifts, Passion, and Story (Exponential Series, Zondervan), or by visiting www.giftpassionstory.com, where you can find resources to help with full implementation in your context. We also highly recommend resources like Younique by Will Mancini and Dave Rhoades, More by Todd Wilson, and The Call by Os Guinness. We believe assessments that move people towards a greater clarity on their calling will elevate every sector of society. To review, we must focus on the Spirit’s outcomes, if we are to see reproducing owners of the faith made. Paul describes the work of the Spirit in two major categories, Fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:2223) and Gifts of the Spirit (Romans 12:6-8, 1 Corinthians 12:1-11, 1 Peter 4:11, Ephesians 4:11-13). In other words, character and calling are the outcomes we focus on. The result of focusing on these two outcomes is impact. As disciples allow the Spirit to cultivate His character in them, and as they allow the Spirit to demonstrate His power through their calling, it will create impact IN them and THROUGH them for good. THE SPIRIT’S OUTCOMES: CHARACTER X CALLING = IMPACT Here’s a simple way to remember the ingredient of Outcome Focused. We call it the Impact Equation, developed by the aforementioned Brian Phipps. The relative impact of developing character and calling can be seen by doing simple math through our impact equation, and that math is very telling. If a person’s character is relatively low, perhaps a 3 on a scale from 1-10, and they have never even heard that Jesus has a calling on their life, perhaps a 1 on a scale from 1-10, then the relative impact they can expect to have is only 3 on a scale of 1-100. Here is the math... 3 (character) x 1 (calling) 3 (Impact) If this person starts to engage with a disciple-making experience that is focused on developing both character and calling, look what happens when their character goes up slightly, but their calling takes a quick jump because they engage a calling discovery and assessment process like GPS … 4 (character) x 3 (calling) 12 (Impact) As you can see, small steps can lead to significant impact. Impact, in turn, becomes the fuel that inspires more character and calling development. This person, for perhaps the first time in their life, is living on purpose. They want to protect and deepen that experience, so they accelerate the pursuit of character development. In turn, God honors that focus with more power through their calling. This changes the math even more... 6 (character) x 5 (calling) 30 (Impact) The Impact has doubled, and so has the fuel for further development because they are experiencing the fully-alive life (John 10:10) Jesus promised, as he lives through them in their context. Over time, as character and calling increase, so does impact! Our experience based on thousands of disciples made here in Kansas City is that an intentional focus on character and calling within the context community can leads to incredible increases in both areas. Ingredient 1, Outcome-focused means Character X Calling = Impact! As a faith leader, at this point, pause and consider the following: To what degree is the goal of our faith community the experience of personal transformation into God-like character? To what degree are people in our faith community experiencing growth in their character from the inside out through the Spirit verses temporary change through restraint and will power? How clearly can we articulate the outcomes of internal transformation? How clearly can the average person in our faith community articulate the outcomes of personal transformation? To what degree are people in our faith community discovering and living into their personal calling? Chapter 9 Habit-Fueled: Owner-Making Ingredient #2 You have heard it said that practice makes perfect. Not true. No one reaches perfection. However, one change will make that phrase more accurate. Practice makes permanent. Our practices literally burn new neural pathways. Neurologist, Curt Thompson, author of the Anatomy of the Soul says, “Anytime we think about changing the course of our mind, we’re talking about neuroplasticity. We’re talking about changing the way our neurons are actually firing. One of the most important elements of helping neuroplasticity to flourish is activating it through the use of attention. I like to describe attention as being the engine that pulls the rest of the train of the mind. There’s nothing that we do throughout the day that does not, in some way, shape or form, involve a shift in attention from one thing to another to another. That attentional change is crucial… if my life is going to be different, I’m going to have to change the focus of my attention and in so doing, activate neuroplasticity. If I want my brain to change, I need to change the focus of my attention.”82 Practice is a form of attentional and intentional change. Practicing something regularly will make it a permanent habit, which can either benefit us or break us. Whether that’s a healthy pattern or a destructive pattern, we become what we practice. Practice makes permanent. A spiritual habit or spiritual practice involves figuring out how to meaningfully engage a piece of spiritual technology that helps you both connect with the Spirit and cultivate your spiritual development, which includes every area of your life. Consider the piece of spiritual technology called contemplative prayer. This is a form of prayer that transcends different faith traditions. During contemplative prayer, one remains silent in prayer, with the hope of moving beyond language to experience directly the mystery of God’s presence. Naturally, we will find our thoughts drifting toward the things we are anxious or preoccupied with. Therefore, pilgrims are encouraged to pick a meaningful word or phrase – perhaps one of God’s names like “I Am” or a word that is symbolic like Shalom that they return to, as a reminder to let those thoughts go, to find a way to return to the center, and simply be in God’s refreshing presence. Another important piece of this spiritual technology is mindfulness of your breathing. The average human breathes 12 to 15 breathes per minute. In contemplative prayer, we intentionally slow down our breathing to 6 to 8 breathes per second. In so doing, we are practicing slowing down and focusing our attention and intention on our breathing and the always-available presence of God. We practice how to disengage the mind chatter that usually dominates all of our attention. We transcend our own judgments, defenses, and the other skipping records in our minds. This practice also lowers the blood pressure and heart rate. This will reduce anxiety because anxiety is a mixture of preoccupation with future states along with high tension physical states. If a pilgrim allows this habit to fuel their heart, mind, body, and soul for 15-20 minutes a day, once or twice a day, for six weeks, they will have radically enhanced their attentional muscle: the ability to separate from mind chatter to a place of rest and clarity. Almost without knowing it, they are practicing the virtues of peace and discernment. In these moments, the Spirit is working in them to transform them from the inside out. This may seem extremely esoteric and unpractical to some, but it is profoundly practical. Let me prove it. Imagine you’re in conflict with your teenage child, a spouse, or a co-worker. The situation, the energy level, and the language are escalating. Underneath this high stake’s conversation, is an easily trigged minefield ready to blow up the relationship. Your temper is rumbling and your about to blow like Mount Vesuvius. You’ve been there before. Maybe recently. Maybe today! Situations that feel dangerous to us activate neural networks in the lower brain that then lead us to automatic behaviors like fight or flight with very little higher brain function. Who is more prepared to handle that situation with peace and discernment, the unpractical praying person or the practical non-praying person? Whose brain is going to have the better chance of operating out of higher brain function instead of devolving to the reptilian brain? The unpractical praying person has been practicing through prayer how to focus their attention, how to disengage their own mind chatter, how to lower their breathing rate, how to lower their muscle tension, and how to be open to Spirit’s presence and wisdom as their source and strength. Can you see how practical prayer is? Patience, mercy, and discernment don’t just pop into existence in such trying situations. They must be practiced, and contemplative prayer is one way to do that. When we begin to arrange our lives around these life-giving spiritual habits, transformation happens. Paul describes the habit-fueled life this way in Philippians 2:13, “for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose,” in other words, I can’t change myself all by myself. I can do behavior modification, but only the Spirit of God, my faith fractal, and amazing grace can change a heart. As a follower of Jesus, I know God works in me by grace through the gospel. But I’m not passive either. I’m not just treading water. Paul also says in vs 12, “Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed--not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence--continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.” While God works in me, I work out through spiritual practices. God works it in. I work it out. Many have misread this and assume people must earn their salvation through good works. But that is totally out of line with what Paul says in the next verse, which we just read, “God is the one who is at work in you, offering unmerited grace.” Within the Christian tradition, Salvation is God’s work from start to finish, accomplished through Jesus life, death, and resurrection. Paul is not asking them to earn their salvation, but rather to think through how to own their participation in their ongoing transformation. Paul is articulating a revolutionary new approach to the habits that Jesus embodied. No longer do we see these habits or good deeds as the end in and of themselves that we muster up to please God or earn some new standing before Him. No longer are we measuring our goodness by the quantity of external religious behaviors. The goodness Jesus is most concerned with is our internal character transformation. By grace, we can become qualitatively different people internally. With this as the end goal, the habits become our way of cooperating with God, by responding to God’s grace. They move us into a flow where we are doing life with God and abiding in him.
