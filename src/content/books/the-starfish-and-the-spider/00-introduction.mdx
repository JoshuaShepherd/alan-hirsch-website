Chapter 1 Arachnophobia and Spider Bites

The greatest danger in times of

turbulence is not the turbulence –it is to act with

yesterday’s logic –Peter Drucker

Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.

It shall not be so among you.”

–Matt. 20:25-26a

The morning newsfeed opens with, yet another story of a high-profile pastor or faith-based leader caught up in a swirl of accusation. Patterns of sustained abuse of one sort or another such as bullying, misuse of position, sexual harassment, or just a plain mental breakdown from the weight of leading has come to light. Pastor Smith of Well-Known Church has resigned, been fired, or is fending off allegations.

When the downfall of famed leadership expert and pastor Bill Hybels came to fruition, the church world was shocked and in dismay. As more and more credible witnesses came forth a pattern of decades long positional leveraging and abuse came to light. Arguably the most influential shaper of evangelical church leadership over the last 50 years had tumbled. And it was the very leadership systems he had purveyed all along that served to camouflage his actions along the way.

Upon hearing each story, we wonder, “Why does this keep happening and who will be next?” The stories have become predictably familiar—unhealthy and ungodly patterns and habits budding and building under the cloak of leadership power, rank, privilege, or the stress of responsibility overload. Though we are always saddened at such news we are becoming less and less surprised. We are usually just disappointed and dismayed that it was that person. But spider webs are like that. They are most often quite invisible until you get very close to them.

Have you ever walked into a spider web or been bitten by a spider? Most likely you had never noticed the web was there until you were already entangled. Or you didn’t feel the bite at first but at some point, discovered a sore or infected spot on some part of your body. Only then did you realize an arachnid had bitten you.

This book is written differently than most books. First, a blessing from an Israeli-Berkley-leadership guru to Three Amigos. Three of us, a South African born Australian transplant leadership guru, a native Texan, and a Midwestern All American , have come together to share our stories, experiences, and findings with a goal of helping churches and faith based leaders in general to move past spidery experiences so they can grow flourishing cultures to help them and their teams fulfill the purpose and mission of their organizations.

With four combined decades of serving as pastors in large, successful churches, and as trainers to thousands of pastors, we (Rob and Lance) both agree that something is amiss in church leadership. Our journeys within the local church have made us weary of spider bites, the wounds of hierarchical, complicated, and heavy-handed leadership. And we admit up front that we have been spider-men ourselves at different times. Hard work was to be expected, but the business of church seems to have become supplanted with the busyness of church and an increasing reliance upon human power in lieu of heavenly power. For us, things got so toxic from the many spider bites that we both resigned positions in large, successful churches. Those crises sent us searching for ways of leading that ring truer to the character of our spiritual leader—Christ—and the things He said about leadership.

Alan has been a big brother, mentor, and dear friend to both of us. It is by no means an overstatement to declare that his influence thoroughly changed our lives and ministries. Through his writing and speaking Alan’s insight into the contemporary church since the turn of the new millennial has affected positive changes arguably like no other. So we asked Alan to step into this book project, providing his thoughts on our thoughts.

As you read this book our aim and hope for you is that we convey a more joyful and productive—less costly at the human level—leadership ethos that will help you develop a culture that reflects these thoughts:

The idea that Jesus provided his leadership model as one that rather than rising, by creating an ascending pyramid to elevate himself, his was a descending circle that empowered others. His initial circle, reproduced similar circles, filling culture with humble servants who also lead courageously, by making heroes of others, empowering and equipping them to be all God has made them to be.

The primary forms of leadership we have been using continue to produce a human cost that is completely unnecessary. Edwards Deming is credited with saying, “Every system is perfectly designed to get the results that it does.” As we embark on the third decade of the new millennium the entertainment industry, corporate business world, and church and faith community has been rocked by a succession of leaders who have been brought down in disgraceful fashion for patterns of behavior linked to bullying, domineering, and abuse of different kinds. On the faith front several high-profile leaders have resigned their posts solely out of exhaustion or for slipping into self-destructive patterns. Some of these leaders were just plain worn out from the weight of carrying a church or organization on one set of shoulders.

Our primary leadership models have emerged from the industrial revolution and the renaissance age that produced singular charismatic hero types. The influence of these eras has had an enormous shaping impact on our current leadership ways and means. Much of what emerges from such concepts runs counter to the culture God advocates for the church and faith-based leadership at large.

We are at a junction in church and faith leadership where credibility and integrity are justly being doubted. We need to ask some uneasy questions about ourselves. The answers we will find not only can lead us to truth but to the truth that will set us free—free to be all that God has designed us to be personally, professionally, and for the sake of the world around us.

Most churches and faith groups, large or small, have the inherent competency and capacity to flourish already in place. What is needed is an understanding of how to unleash the latent wisdom, understanding, talents, and joy that will fuel their tasks and journey.

We (Rob and Lance) will share our own firsthand spidery experiences throughout the book as well as stories and situations we have encountered in several years of working with faith leaders throughout North America and globally. Alan will speak to various issues and contexts throughout the book, bringing his advice and experience to bear upon the topics and subjects at hand.

What A Tangled Web (Lance’s Story)

The first time I (Lance) knew a spider leader had bitten me was shortly after joining the staff of a medium sized West Texas church, straight out of bible college. My initial stint on a church staff was as a youth pastor at a small but healthy fellowship during my bible school years. Sam, the pastor of that church led from a joyful and loving humility. He was patient, forgiving, sharing, secure in who he was, and treated no one as lesser than himself. Resolute when necessary but always fair and open to viewpoints not his own, Sam’s leadership style seemed to match up with the character and fruit I

imagined from the shepherd leaders I had studied in the bible. But things would be different at my first postgraduate assignment on the dusty West Texas plains. Within three months I had been screamed at over the phone, physically shoved against an office wall, reprimanded through gritted teeth multiple times, and had my complete wardrobe replaced—all by the senior “shepherd”. This was the first time I ever heard a pastor declare, “Church is a business and has to be run like a business.” It wouldn’t be the last time.

Over the next ten years or so I would take on spider leadership tendencies myself. Like thousands of other young pastors and church planters I sought the best leadership conferences and read every leadership book I could find, especially those recommended by pastors of well-known and growing churches. I was seeking wisdom and advice from my heroes, pastors who had grown big churches. As I was about to embark on starting a new church near St. Louis, the answer one such pastor gave to me when I asked him for the most important ingredient in planting a successful church was two words, “The guy.”—i.e. a single standout hero type. In other words, my inner Peter Parker would need to get his spider game on.

So, for the next few years I continued to focus on learning leadership from the most notable authors and speakers and the theme continued to galvanize: Being a great leader must be a main goal and leadership is about being a person who has the charisma, talent, expertise, and authority to get others to follow him or herself.

The overarching idea was that building a great church or faith community involves creating a well-oiled leadership machine with structures and systems promoting the vision of the visionary and the mission he or she lays out and charts the course toward. As the years wore on I began to develop a growing unease and disenchantment with much of what I was seeing, reading, hearing—and quite frankly was doing myself—in relation to church leadership, along with the weight and pressure to “make it work” and “make it grow”.

So much of the ways and means of leadership seemed to ignore the habits and character of Jesus and what I read in the New Testament epistles regarding the treatment of others. On top of it all was a particular loneliness of being the guy. Something seemed off. I wondered how one person could be expected to have the stamina and energy to carry so much leadership weight and pressure. And who in their right mind—or ego—believed one human could have the talent, giftings, and wisdom capacity to know what should always be done?

Midway through the first decade of the new millennium, after ten years of leading the church I founded in St. Louis I resigned out of senior pastor exhaustion to lead the church planting efforts and serve on the pastoral staff of a large church in Texas. The mistake I made was that I ran deeper into the very system and leadership myth I was seeking to escape from. I went from being the spider to being the one caught in the spider web. This would be the highest command and control environment I had ever been part of.

Not long before I arrived a new Executive Pastor had been installed with the task of overseeing and managing the entire pastoral staff. He was a really brilliant and nice guy that was never even remotely harsh toward me or anyone else to my knowledge. But it seemed quite odd that someone who had precisely zero experience as a pastor or church leader, much less any formal theological training, was giving daily marching orders to the entire spiritual leadership community of the church. Several of us on the staff had pastored flourishing churches. Nevertheless, this 2nd Chair leader (as some call them) had

an impressive resume from the corporate world and therefore was deemed perfectly suited to lead this church in its operational basis. This practice has become common among contemporary churches.

The Executive Pastor stood between the Senior Pastor and the rest of the staff and was in control of day-to-day functions in a clear line of authority. Policy decisions, schedules, strategic initiatives, all of it, were the prerogative of the EP. Those under the EP were in place to implement the marching orders of

the Senior and Executive Pastors without question. This leadership paradigm assumes the need for clear lines of demarcation or boxes that separate the thinkers from the doers. It is classic top-down. Thinking happens at the top and doing happens at the bottom. Information, disseminated on a need-to-know basis, created a cloud of unease over the pastoral staff. Otherwise secure, gregarious, boisterous men and women became subdued and even childlike when the Senior Pastor entered the room. The atmosphere contained a discernable aspect of secrecy and distrust. And it was the SP and EP who decided what and who would know whatever and whenever.

Coming from a corporate command and control culture, the Executive Pastor considered it his job to manage everyone’s schedule. One morning after hearing that a couple of staff pastors and I were spending the first 20 minutes of our mornings together in a time of worship with a guitar, he called me to his office to tell me we would need to “do that on your own time.” Taken aback, I asked him if he thought I was doing well with my area of responsibilities. “Mike, do you think I’m getting my job done? Do you think the other guys are getting their jobs done?” I asked. He enthusiastically said, “Oh, yeah, you guys are doing great.” “Then what is the rub? What does it matter to you how we start our days?” He answered, “Because this is the office. The office is for business. And it’s my job to maintain that.” Leadership cultures fueled by management systems such as this contain a belief that people perform best under controls and guidelines. It is as if there are only a few adults in the mix and the rest are incompetent or lacking the crucial self-motivation or self-discipline to carry out the areas they are tasked to. Church business has to come this.

By the mid 1990’s two decades of what was called the church growth movement shifted focus as more and more leaders in the field of faith became fixated on the subject of leadership. The trend has continued to the present. The mantra, “everything rises or falls on leadership” is almost universally unquestioned by learned pastors and faith leaders. And there is at least a shade of truth in that saying. What is seldom questioned though is the type of leadership our future depends upon.

Today the primary idea is that to develop a healthy and flourishing faith organization means there has to be a single leader that stands out as the best strategist, theologian, visionary, communicator, and CEO. Over recent years as the leadership emphasis took front and center, before anyone seemed to notice, the faith community was looking outside of itself and the wisdom of the sacred texts for its primray leadership answers from the corporate sector.

It wasn’t long until tens of thousands of faith leaders had attended church sponsored summits with speakers from Bill Clinton to Melinda Gates and kept bookshelves housing volumes written by or about such luminaries as Attila the Hun to “Neutron” Jack Welch. If church is a business, then why not learn from those who are best at business was the rationale. This is not to say there is not much to be learned from business leaders. In fact, in this book we will be drawing on concepts from the business world. The issue in such learning is that the advice and practices we accept from anyone must pass through the filter of Jesus—his ways, ethics, commandments, and heart.

The F Word (Rob’s Story)

I (Rob) was one of those eager students, learning all I could from leaders from every sector of society. I do believe all truth is God’s truth. Therefore, leadership truth can be discovered and applied from every sector. However, my mindful critique of these sources was not thorough enough. Without realizing, I was importing extrabiblical frameworks and principles. Over time, I began to feel the corrosive effect. It came to a head at a surprising moment.

Some twenty years into my vocational ministry journey in a large church, I was on a five-day retreat to be spent in silence at a monastery. This was part of a larger sabbatical given to me after those twenty years of service. The first two nights, I didn’t sleep well, tossing and turning the whole night.

Nightmares plagued me. I was exhausted by day three.

That afternoon, I had finished praying the midafternoon office with the monks. As I made my way back to my cabin, my thoughts drifted toward an individual, a church leader, whom I loved dearly, my boss, and without a doubt, one of the most meaningful mentors of my life. I stand on his shoulders. He’s believed in me and blessed me in ways beyond number.

And yet, as his face came to mind, a torrent of anger burst up out of me, along with a string of expletives that I won’t print here. To say that I was shocked would be an understatement. I felt dizzied and mumbled, “Where in hell did that come from?”

Up to that point, I wasn’t living with any vivid awareness of that venom in my soul. On the surface, I thought I was experiencing the typical frustrations common in any church. My soul was apparently telling me otherwise. The explosion of rage felt so primal and involuntary, like vomiting a bad meal that has given you food poisoning.

This poison was from spider-bites…many of them.

In the aftermath, as the wave of rage passed, at first, I was ashamed that I had said the F word, cursing someone I loved. However, the revealing of that feeling was the beginning of the healing. I prayed, “Lord, help me to understand what is going on in the mystery of my heart.”

Over the next few hours and days of solitude, as I prayed and journaled, the scales began to fall off my eyes. Habitual behaviors in this person’s life had wounded me, but the problem was more systemic than that. A tangled web of “leadership” values and tactics had enmeshed me and many others, perpetuating spider-bites. Our church wasn’t unique in this. These were values and tactics championed in the church growth movement and studied in church leadership conferences, which had now become normative in thousands of churches.

Suddenly, this twenty-year, singular hero story about a progressive, prevailing church plant that became one of the most influential mega-churches in America, flipped into a multi-level horror story. Later, I would be able to see the complexity and nuance of the story – both its beauty and brokenness, both the hero and horror in a fuller way. No story or life is just one thing. In that moment, however, the dark side of the story, which I had largely repressed, looked away from, or excused, swallowed me.

In the darkness, we usually look for someone else to blame, to absolve ourselves from the problem. But I knew in that moment, I was complicit.

During those days of solitude, in prayer and journaling, I revisited the deep places of idolatry in my soul that had allowed me to lose my way. I revisited the wounds and wept. Jesus met my F word with an even stronger F word. By God’s grace, I was able to receive and also pass on what had been given to me in limitless measure: Forgiveness.

As a young man, what I had seen as powerful and progressive in church leadership in my twenties, now at the dawn of my forties, felt crushing and suffocating.

Upstairs, I looked like I had it going on. Down in the basement, I had a heavy, dirty soul. The hurt inflicted by that pastor, the impact of a toxic culture and the shame I felt over the ways I exerted my influence for my benefit –all of it had been buried deep in the basement of my soul and hidden behind a false wall. The combination of the three days of silence and prayer mixed with the physical exhaustion, not to mention the preceding detonations set off by the spiritual directors my wife and I had been meeting with, caused that wall to crumble.

The years of hurt I had buried, the undercover sense of shame over my contribution to a contaminated leadership culture, and all the unforgiveness I had harbored came pouring out.

By the end of the retreat, I literally felt a hundred pounds lighter. I slept like a baby those last few nights. But the most difficult season of my life lay ahead. The soul work had only begun. During the next season, I found myself at a crossroads, as the pastor and the culture of that church continued harder and faster in the same direction. Prior to this sabbatical, the pathway was clear. Most people assumed I was the heir apparent. Now, I felt lost. Dante describes the experience this way: “In the middle of life, I found myself in a dark wood.”1

The dark night of the soul. I remember the darkest point.

It was literally a pitch-dark night in the dead of winter, I walked alone on the gravel berm of a country road. Our town wasn’t incorporated, so no sidewalks. Figures, right? A few hundred yards away, the headlights were barreling towards me, on my side of the road. The thought in my head, stuck on repeat, skipping like a scratched record, "End it."

As the car closed in, I thought, "It would be so much easier to just step in front of that car. I'm just two feet away from the pain being over."

That's where my two-decade journey with church leadership had landed me.

A collision of crises in the church and our family, a toxic church leadership culture, and unresolved wounds from my past, combined into a season of depression that was so dark, there were days where I was non-functional. I questioned all my deepest held beliefs. More than once I thought to myself, “I think they’ll pull my pastor card if I end up an atheist.”

The darkness went on not for days or weeks, but months. I kept muscling my way through.

Externally, I was the envy of my peers. A church of thousands. A national reputation. A book published with just the right publisher in just the right book series. Gigs at the cool conferences. Coaching and training other church leaders.

Internally, I was crushed to the point of despair.

As I continued to do deeper soul work with a spiritual director and moved regularly into inner healing prayer with another mentor, I felt like the blind man who had the two-stage restoration of sight. First things were blurry, but with Jesus’s continued touch, clarity increased. Of course, this miracle in Mark 8:22-25 was proceeded with a question meant to provoke his “blind” disciples in Mark 8:21, “Do you still not understand?”

A bit at a time, I understood more deeply. Jesus and the Gospel could meet my deepest needs.

A bit at a time, I understood more deeply. The leadership model championed in the modern church had become a confused web of unanchored Bible verses, cut and paste business practices, unedited marketplace values, and unchecked motives, where many great “leaders” are unconsciously working out of their own woundedness through narcissism and power tactics.

I had seen the dark underbelly of many churches. You can’t be much more of an insider in the megachurch world than I have been. A few examples, for your consideration. These are run of the mill, not the zingers.

In an important private meeting about the future of the church, with just myself and the other “top” two guys, one of them said, “I see this church as a business with three co-owners. That’s whose sitting at this table, the co-owners of this church.”

Are we going to cut Jesus in and give Him 25% of His church too?

Before a conference we were hosting, I wanted to welcome one of the keynote speakers and introduce myself. I stuck my head into the green room and said, “I just wanted to welcome Steven.” One of his entourage intervened, stepped in front of me, and said, “He is not Steven. He is Pastor Steve. That is the title of honor he deserves.” With the grace of Michael Scott, I awkwardly slide back out of the room, making eye contact with the PASTOR, who did not speak to me.

Only one Person in the New Testament receives the “title” of lead pastor (1 Peter 5:4). His name isn’t Steven.

While interviewing for a job with one of the most influential pastors in the world, one of the staff members said to my wife, “Think of Rob’s potential stint here like military service. Imagine he’s serving in Afghanistan on a two-year tour of duty. You won’t see him much, but you’ll know he’s making a difference somewhere. Then, at the end of the two years, he’ll be back home. He can put on his resume that he worked at church. At that point, the sky’s the limit on consulting or working wherever he wants!”

Ah, where’s that verse in the Bible that says, “Being a shepherd is a career pathway to be managed for upward mobility and personal profit.” Or the one that says, “They who ignore their spouse for a few years are blessed, as long as your mistress is the Church.”

The tactics and values seen as necessary for the maintenance of leadership excellence in the church, have often been shaming and bullying tactics that have crushed people’s souls. Patterns lauded as sure-fire ways to build a culture of honor and gratitude, have, in fact, created a culture of celebrity for a few in each church and a caste system for the rest.

When the Church is dysfunctional, it is the most appalling of all institutions because the stakes are so high, precisely because her potential for beauty is so great and our love for her is so deep

The Spider, The Starfish, Ori, Lance, and Rob

Many of the leadership concepts utilized by today’s faith communities are built on the very things Jesus clearly rebuked. We design systems in pyramid form, usually with one person or a few at the top with dominant power. What Ori Brafman, in his book The Spider and the Starfish, has entitled, the Spider. This form of leadership has infected the church.

As we mentioned earlier, in just the last few years, we have witnessed a pattern where every few months we receive news of yet another singular at-the-top leader either resigning or being forced to step down in light of confession or accusations of some form of bullying, abuse, or manipulation of staff members or the opposite sex. For example, famed Seattle pastor Mark Driscoll resigned after the board of elders at his church declared he had “been guilty of arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner."2 Or consider the tragic descent of Bill Hybels, as numerous women step forward courageously to uncover a pattern of oppression and manipulation that was rampant for years. Both of these individuals were lauded as “best in class” in church leadership up until the very moment the veil was pulled back. By all means, we long only for their full restoration. Their stories serve as a warning to all of us in church leadership, who at some level or another have been complicit with oppressive and self-benefiting forms of leadership, at some point in our life. But it is also about more than just individual “character flaws.” There is a system behind these failures that must be addressed. It would be incredibly naïve to write these off as merely personal failures, and not question the form of leadership and the institutional systems that form of leadership creates. Each of these situations would not have been able to be sustained in a starfish leadership culture. We must ask if more leadership is not what is needed but instead, a far different type of leadership is necessary.

Rigid systems are a great fit amidst the drive for predictability, but the human cost comes as they tend to foster cultures of fear and depersonalization instead of expectation, creativity, and uniqueness.

Worse yet, they are a greenhouse for domineering, bullying, and even sexual abuse. To say the least, they quench the Holy Spirit. London Business School Professor of Organizational Behavior Daniel Cable writes

This so-called executive disease is common because power changes how leaders view other people—research shows that power causes people to see others as a means to their ends rather than as intelligent humans with ideas and emotions. In organizational life, power can result in arrogance and self-importance, and executives too often use their power to bully and frighten employees into compliance.3

The rank-based concepts behind spider leadership create a dichotomy: leaders, a select and privileged few, and followers, the vast majority.4 This type of thinking quashes the collective intelligence of an organization. It shuts down creativity, heart, and drive, all beneath the mindset that only a small group of “gifted” ones contain the competence for decision-making. Sadly, leadership like this slams the door on the unlimited potential of the majority of our team members. Even more tragic is the gifts that God wants to give our organizations via the silenced majority are summarily rejected by the upper echelon. When this happens, we are not playing with the full deck God has dealt us.

Power hoarding through rank-based thinking has an underlying arrogance and scarcity mentality. The subtle belief is there is a rare amount of wisdom and qualified talent in the room. But the reality is there is more than enough intelligence, knowledge, creativity and experience existing in most organizations, but it is often hidden in the basement belief system of a scarcity mentality that assumes these assets are limited to a select few who occupy the loftiest titles.

Cable, says, “Many organizations are deactivating the part of employees’ brains called the seeking system. Our seeking systems create the natural impulse to explore our worlds, learn about environments, and extract meaning from our circumstances.”5 The seeking system within our biological make up is not just ability for creativity; it also is a key to whether we want to crawl out of bed from morning to morning. Cable continues, “Most neuroscientists agree...that one of the most basic emotional systems pertains to a functionally identifiable circuit that depends on dopamine, and that emotional system might be called interest, anticipation, or seeking.”6 In other words, when we shut down people’s seeking systems we are choking the very life out of them.

But, as you already know, another option lies open before us: The Starfish.

Not long after Ori’s book The Starfish and The Spider came out a copy landed in our (Lance and Rob) mailboxes. Both of us were excited to discover someone was putting language and solutions to the problem. Albeit, Ori was not a church leader nor was the book aimed at faith organizations.

Nevertheless, we both knew this is how Godly leadership should be shaped. It points us to the way we should be as leaders and how our organizations can flourish and be joyful places to work within.

This agnostic professor, from one of the most secular universities in America, through his research, had rediscovered a generous, open, service-oriented, empowering form of leadership. He dubbed it “Starfish,” using the brilliant analogy of the Spider and the Starfish, comparing the two forms of leadership we’ve been contrasting. Ori articulated Starfish leadership with genius and clarity, and it begin to infect hundreds of businesses and non-profits, became a New York Times Bestseller, and eventually, even the US military officer training school began to adapt their training based on Ori’s work.

Over time, by providence and blessing, Lance and Ori met at a conference, at which they were both speaking. They hit it off. Rob was friends with Lance and a super fan of Ori’s work, so Lance introduced them. Basically, a Cable Guy situation, where Rob was the Jim Carry character and Ori played Matthew Broadrick. Conversations ensued. Friendships deepened. Stereotypes were deconstructed. Spiritual journeys connected. We are grateful to Ori for his blessing to extend and reinterpret the Starfissh for the church context.

From Lance and Rob’s perspective, Jesus is the origin point of Starfish leadership. Ori is reinterpreting it and, with great academic rigor, demonstrating the viability of it in every sector of society. Over the last 15 years, Rob and Lance have found Ori’s “outside” perspective both prophetic and incredibly helpful in reapplying Jesus’ leadership ethos back to the Church. What has developed is a series or system of “Starfish” that we hope will help church leaders rediscover Jesus’ leadership in a fresh and practical way.

Over the course of this book we will unpack seven Starfish, that we hope will reinvigorate church leadership with the vision, values and practices to rediscover Jesus’ leadership orthodoxy and orthopraxy.

As we shared our stories earlier in this chapter, we (Lance and I) hope we don’t come off like angsty teenagers, because honestly, we love the church leaders involved in these practices. These are our people. We are for them. We are them.

If you’ve been spider-bit, it’s easy to objectify and hate the pastor or church leader who hurt you. But, the “megachurch pastor” or “church leader” we want to resent, dislike or slam –– carries our own dark side. That’s why Jesus says, “Love your enemies.” If we love our enemies, eventually we’ll realize that a lot of our enemy-hating is all about us projecting our own darkness onto someone else.

Our criticism of the current, prevailing church leadership approach is not blind negativity. We understand on the ground; most pastors are doing their best to lead in a faithful way. Yet, we can’t ignore the crisis. We want to stand on “the edge of the inside,” and provide a hopeful critique we pray will lead to a faithful return to what Jesus has in mind for His church.

People who truly, deeply love something have earned the right to critique and help make it truer to its deepest vision. We’ve both given our entire adult lives to serving the organized church. These things of which we write, have been worked out in blood, sweat, prayer, and tears.

One of the unique aspects of our Scriptures, that differs greatly from the other world religions, is that our prophets – voices like Isaiah or Jeremiah in the Old Testament and James and Paul in the New Testament are free to both profoundly love the tradition and profoundly criticize it at the same time. Their love demands that they do so. If we didn’t love the organized church and her leaders so much, we wouldn’t bother to write this book. Jesus offered this faithful critique masterfully. We seek to follow His example in these pages.

As you read, we hope you feel our deep love for the church and her leaders. As you read, we also hope you feel us poking you in the chest…because, in Jesus name, you can do this.

Chapter 2
“The more I consider Christianity, the more I found that while it has established a rule and order, the chief aim of that order was to give room for good things to

run wild.”

G.K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy.

"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said. "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your

teaching.” Acts 5:28

The year, 1984: A time for huge bangs on young ladies, mullets on young men, jam shorts, ripped jeans, Michael Jackson, and hair-metal bands. Obviously, the American culture had reached a place of unrivaled refinement. A missionary kid turned youth pastor, Dan Gute, looked at this Ferris Bueller wannabe, a 14-year old version of me, and saw someone who could be a catalyst for something more than hijinks and practical jokes. He invited a rag-tag group of teenagers, about twelve oddly enough, and invited us to become disciples who could make disciples. We were young enough to believe we could do it. Over the next years, Jesus walked among us, transformed lives and turned that youth group of a sleepy, insular Baptist church into a little movement of sorts.

The holy rumpus erupted in us as we experienced Jesus personally, hearing His voice and seeing His face. The good things ran wild through the halls of our schools as we shared our faith. The primal drumbeat of eternal life – not just quantity, but quality pounded in us, as we gathered around hidden firepits in the forest to pray and worship. We knew something ancient and original was happening: A holy rumpus, anchored and deeply rooted, yet unhinged and fresh. We read the book of Acts as a script we could be actors in and exclaimed to ourselves, “This is real. Jesus is actually doing this stuff today, here and now!”

The whole thing felt dangerous and unpredictable.

A couple years into that awakening, the number of teenagers gathered one evening in the old sanctuary was equal to the size of the entire church body. More than 40 of our friends decided to follow Jesus that night. Sure, looking back I can see the baggage we were carrying, but were unaware of. The suitcase stuffed things like a radically-reduced, wafer-thin, fire insurance version of the gospel, a young arrogance, a deep dualism that created walls between us and the whimsical, transforming, comprehensive Holiness of God that is everywhere, identities wrapped up in our religious performance, and the list of items crammed in there goes on.

But none of that canceled out the essence of what was happening. Which makes it all the more amazing!

The old “order” had given room for “good things to run wild.”

In the afterglow of that evening, I remarked to Dan, “I’m kind of surprised all the older folks are ok with us using the sanctuary for our stuff. This was kind of a crazy night.” With a mischievous glint in his eyes, Dan grinned and replied, “Some of them know. They’ve been praying for us. But I want you to remember something, Rob. Sometimes it’s easier to ask forgiveness than permission.”

In the midst of the tension between the old order, spider-like, and standing still, and the new order of starfish, decentralized expression of church, I discovered my calling to lead.

What about your calling to lead? Did it come to you in the midst of good things running wild? I bet it did. You responded to that call to empower and release more good things to run wild in and through a faith community, non-profit, marketplace endeavor or wherever you make your contribution.

Early in my story, I had an experience inside the old order of the church, where good things ran wild in me, and the Spirit set my soul on fire. That experience created a deep longing in me that made me say “Let the wild, holy rumpus start!” I bet you felt that too!

Yet, I also wager somewhere along the line, you’ve felt the order constricting the wild, good things, to the point where they are no longer able to run wild. In most churches and organizations, the order is the only goal. In that case, any good things that are wild have to be domesticated. Eventually, one day, you realize that you’re running the order machine. In quiet moments of desperation, you think, “I didn’t sign up for this. Where did all the wild things go? I signed up to help fuel a Jesus movement, but now I feel like I’m running a machine.”

In my line of work, close to fifteen hundred pastors leave the ministry every month. If they were given the opportunity to make a similar salary doing something else, most pastors surveyed said they’d jump at it. 7

Many of us are weary of being keepers of the order.

My youth pastor Dan used that wild moment to help me see the embodiment of Chesterton’s essential point: The centralized expression of the faith community exists to empower and release the decentralized expression of the faith community, so good things can run wild.

The center exists to empower the margins, not the other way around.

That is the main thrust of this book, the restoration of the running wild decentralized expression of the church and the empowerment of the pursuant form of leadership that can and will release it. In other words, you don’t have to ask permission from “the order,” Jesus has already ordained and commissioned the good things to run wild. You can find your sacred mojo again.

That does not mean we condemn or abandon the centralized form of church (or any organization bent on adding value to the world). We need both!

In The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations, Ori refers to this blending as the Combo Special: The Hybrid Organization. Rather than seeing it as an either/or, Spider or Starfish, we can go the way of both/and. What kind of creature would that be? You can splice those genes in one of two ways. Either you have a Spiderfish or a Starder.

Canoeing the Mountains: Christian Leadership in Uncharted Territory (p. 229). InterVarsity Press. Kindle Edition.

The Spider, the Spiderfish, the Starder, and Starfish exist on a continuum, moving from centralization to decentralization.

At first glance, the Spider and the Starfish are similar in appearance. They both appear to have a bunch of appendages coming out of a central body, but that’s where the similarities end. With the Spider, a head is a head, a body is a body, and a leg is a leg. You have a centralized brain calling the shots. If you chop the head off the Spider, it’s game over.

However, with the Starfish you have no head. If you cut the starfish in half the animal doesn’t die, it reproduces. Now you have two starfish. A group called OUCH discovered this the hard way. OUCH – the Order of the Underwater Coral Heroes, was a group of rogue divers launched in the late 1990s, existed to defend the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The starfish were growing so numerous, they were beginning to destroy the coral. Taking matters into their own hands, they’d dive with their knives and the cut the starfish in half to kill them. One problem, the halves generated into new starfish. A two for one Starfish special! How does that happen? “They can achieve this magical regeneration because in reality, a starfish is a neural network—basically a network of cells. Instead of having a head, like a spider, the starfish functions as a decentralized network.”8

In this chapter we begin with a review of the most common understanding of the organized church (Spider) and then reimagine faith communities as flourishing, reproducing networks of reproducing owners of the faith – what Jesus called disciples transforming the world by way of good things running wild (Starfish). We will also explore the hybrids that exists between these ends of the continuum.

The Spider expression is a centralized form of church oriented around one location, one congregation, and one gathering, under the authority one leadership head, usually a senior leader or pastor, working with a board or council. The locus of power is centralized in that head (represented by the blackened circle). This is the prevailing model in the American

church with more than half of US Churches having one location, one service, and one leadership head9. Most organizations and businesses have this leadership model and form of governance, as well.

The Spider’s locus of power works like a strand of Christmas lights. If the one bulb (the centralized locus of power in the senior pastor) at the top goes out on the single string, so does every bulb below it. The pastor and the board/staff emanate the current (direction, programs, etc.) that the congregants connect with.

At the other end of the continuum, the Starfish expression is a decentralized expression of the church oriented around multiple locations, multiple congregations, multiple gatherings, and multiple leaders. Imagine the church as a decentralized network of multiplying disciples, missional leaders, and microchurches.

The Starfish, within the Christian tradition, may be best represented by viral spread of the underground organic church movements in China, India, and many other places around the world.

One of the greatest privileges of my life is the honor of consistently serving indigenous church planting movements in India, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, and South Africa. These Starfish leaders are among my most treasured friends, mentors, and co-laborers. Experiencing these Starfish movements firsthand has changed my sense of what is possible for the church. For example, in a 10-year window in Southern India, what started with a handful of like-minded leaders training a cohort of about 30 ordinary folks, what we would call bi-vocational pastors, multiplied into a movement of more than 2000 churches including over 180,000 people, making disciples who made disciples that formed microchurches that reproduced microchurches among unreached people in previously unreached villages. There was hardly a paid professional pastor among the whole movement. Stories like this from around the world, in our time, are multiplied in the thousands. It’s breath-taking.

Returning home to help lead the modern evangelical megachurch I was pastoring was a whiplash to say the least. One Sunday, I’m watching the good things run wild, a viral movement of reproducing disciples and microchurches sweeping the land. Next Sunday, I’m back to “church as usual:” services timed to the second tracked in real-time with software, bands with lightshows and hazers, “killer” video, church programs for this and that, the next great relevant, catchy weekend series, etc., ad nauseum.

Honestly, sometimes, it made my stomach hurt. Don’t misunderstand, I was for all those things. God was using them to draw people to himself and then transform them. And yet, against the backdrop of this disciple-making movement in India, by comparison, so few were truly being empowered to their maximum influence. People had to settle for being a “volunteer.” We were growing by addition, yet so few were actually making new disciples themselves. One needed to bring them to a building for service or a program designed by a paid professional, who could do the heavy lifting for you.

By God’s grace, I had enough experience to know that responding like an angry adolescent, screaming, “Burn it down!” would be a waste. That posture would have caused me to miss the point of what the Spirit was saying and teaching me.

What was the Spirit saying to me? “Rob, why not here? Why not now?”

He is still saying that to me... daily, hourly, moment by moment. It has gripped my soul. How about you?

Starfish doesn’t just happen “over there.” Here in the States, my friend Brian Sanders and a handful of Starfish leaders have been the spark for a similar movement in Tampa Florida, called the Underground Network, which has now reproduced more than 300 micro-churches. That has spanned new microchurch movements in 21 other cities, including the Kansas City Underground, the family of microchurches here in KC, which I serve and lead. Or consider one of my coaches, Jeff Vanderstelt, and the Soma movement. What started as a handful of missional communities in Tacoma, has now become a network of hundreds of missional communities gathering in congregations in 48 cities. How about the amazing movement Jesus has unleashed through Hope Chapel and the leadership of Ralph Moore?

More than 2300 churches and counting!

These are expressions of church that are growing not just by addition, but multiplication. No matter how fast you hit the addition button, it can’t keep up with the impact of multiplication.
The Exponential church planting network has created and entitled this expression of church as Level 5:

Multiplying. At this level, disciples and churches are multiplying on multiple strands out to at least, the fourth generation. In comparison, Level 1 churches are subtracting, and Level 2 churches are plateaued. Currently, right at 80% of the churches in America are at level 1

and 2. Level 3 churches are adding, growing by addition by finding and solving the problems that limit growth. This growth happens mostly through innovating on the methods of the church growth movement, scaling that out through multiple venues or multisite. Currently, 16% of the churches in America are growing by addition. Level 4 churches are reproducing. This is largely represented by the massive growth of church planting. At Level 4, leaders are no longer just thinking about putting more trees in their orchard through multisite, rather they are interested in planting new orchards by planting churches that plant churches. Approximately 4% of U.S. churches are growing by reproduction.

Against that backdrop, Level 5 Multipliers, however, see multiplying disciples, leaders, mircochurches, large churches, and networks as normal. They are planning for gospel saturation in a city or region.

Their scorecard is no longer “how many have accumulated at the center,” but “how many have been sent to the margins to multiple disciples and churches.” Level Five is represented by less than .005 percent of U.S. churches.10

At Levels 1 and 2 the message is ‘Please stay.’ At Levels 3 and 4 the message is ‘Please come.’

At Level 5 the faith community is a launchpad saying, ‘Please GO!’

Maybe you’re wondering, “Isn’t Level 5 just another denomination? Or what about a church with a larger number of multisites, like LifeChurch.tv11, isn’t that level 5? Aren’t those considered Starfish?”

Remember on the surface, spiders and starfish can look the same in appearances. It’s what happening beneath the surface in terms of the locus of power that makes the difference between a Spider Church and a Starfish Church. In denominations and franchise multisites (multisites that clone the original site with tight control on branding, decision making and teaching), the locus of power is like a hub and spokes. The power flows from the hub out and down along the spokes. If the hub is removed, the network disappears.

If the main church in the franchise multisite network, which distributes to the multisites were to turn off, the entire network disappears. Similarly, in many denominations, churches agree on common theological and philosophical distinctives and choose to relate under a centralized authority.

Denominations have credentialing processes, dedicated educational institutions, mission agencies, and an agreed upon hierarchy. If somehow an entire denominational head was removed in one moment, the

denomination would either disperse, or they would need to immediately appoint a new head. I know of one major denomination right now that has several new heads developing in backroom conversations because of a theological controversy. They want to be ready to have a new hub and spoke network in place, when it comes time to pull out of the old one. Anyone want to be the new bishop?

In the Starfish expression, the locus of power is spread throughout the network in many locations, leaders and teams, like the internet. The power doesn’t reside in one starfish, but multiple starfish that operate like nodes throughout the network. The power and information move in multiple directions, depending on the usage and need within the network. The goal is to multiply and connect disciples, leaders, teams, churches, and networks in interdependent ways. Within the network, there are multiple points of power. There are multiple leadership teams working interdependently with the goal of gospel saturation in a city, region, or country.

Let’s review by comparing the two extreme ends of the continuum. In the next chapter we will take a look at the example of the early church for deeper insight.
Is there someone in charge?

Yes. Depends on hierarchy. One leader/board locally, often with another larger hierarchy denominationally. Pyramids with a few leaders at the top.

No. Flat structure. Relies on influence rather than control. Multiplied leaders and leadership teams.

Reproducing circles of leaders.

Is there a headquarters?

If you thump it on the head, will it die?

Is there a clear division of roles?

Yes. The church or faith community is strongly associated with one leader with centralized programs at a building. Church is an activity, building or eventSo, we, “Go to church.”

Yes. Take out the lead pastor/board/boss and it dies, unless you quickly sow on a new head.

Yes. Divided into centralized departments and programs with delineated staff and volunteer roles

No. Location is flexible. Church is spread out in every domain of society making disciples, forming simple expressions of church that are connected with larger, more organized expressions of church, that work to make the Kingdom tangible. Church is an identitySo, we can only, “Be the Church.”

No. If you take out the leaders, new leaders emerge because of reproducing disciples, leaders, teams and churches is normal.

No. Anyone can do anything based on the development of character (fruit of the Spirit) and calling (gifts of

for people to fill. There are slots to fill to help us run the centralized programs. Invite your friends to church so they can do the same.

Reach and accumulate.

the Spirit) in each person. The leaders equip everyone to discover their calling and develop their character. People are deployed into mission where they live, work, learn, and play, where they make disciples, form Kingdom initiatives, make disciples, see microchurches emerge, etc.

Equip and Release.

If you take out a unit, is the organization harmed?

Are knowledge and power concentrated or distributed?

Yes. Every department is necessary, especially the weekend services.

Remove the weekend services and the church disperses.

Centralized. Information and power are concentrated at the top with the lead pastor or lead team.

No. The network can rebuild itself and is connected like cells in the Body. Even without weekly weekend services, the collective of disciples and smaller expressions of church keep reproducing.

Decentralized. Information and power are dispersed throughout the network of reproducing disciples and churches.

Is the organization flexible or rigid?

Rigid. We have a lead pastor who fills the staff team, who runs the church. This structure will never change.

Flexible. The organization is amorphous and fluid, leading to agility. Constantly growing, shrinking, mutating, spreading, dying, and rebirthing. New leadership teams are constantly emerging, who relate in dynamic ways to other leadership teams in the decentralized network of the church, filling a city or a region.

Can you count it?

Yes. Weekend attendance and church membership in a particular location or brand of church are fixed and can be counted.

Not fully. Membership is fluid and open as disciples work together in networks and neighborhoods, even though they may connect with different congregations. Nobody is able to fully keep track of the discipling relationships, reproducing disciples, leaders, teams and

churches in the city or regional network.

How is it funded?

Centrally funded. Offerings come to center and are distributed, with a priority on the center. Without funding, departments or programs quickly die.

Self-Funding. A liberated financial model, where disciples, leaders, teams, and microchurches are responsible for sourcing and stewarding funds. We minimize the need for resources at the center, so the apostolic mission at the margins can be prioritized.

How does communication work?

From the top down, from the pastors through intermediaries. Important information is processed through HQ. The pastors are paid to be the experts endowed with special knowledge others are dependent on, who always have the answer. “All roads lead to Rome.” Every church has its own Pope.

From the bottom up, directly between the disciples, leaders and churches in the network. The greatest learning happens at the edges, where discipleship and mission collide. Leaders facilitate collective intelligence by listening and reporting to the network. No roads lead to Rome, because there is no Rome. Jesus is the Pope for the Church.
Blink Question #1: Which one, the Spider or the Starfish, best expresses the story of the church found in the book of Acts and the rest of the New Testament?

Blink Question #2: Which one, the Spider or the Starfish, best expresses the story of the faith community you currently lead?

Without a doubt, the early church is a story told at the Starfish end of the continuum.

Most of us are charged to lead faith communities living at the Spider end of the continuum. A poverty of imagination causes us to keep trying Spider solutions for the challenges that we are up against.

However, the challenges described in chapter 1 actually require a Starfish operating system to be solved.

To begin, we must reimagine church through the original Starfish design Jesus gave it. We’ll explore that in the next chapter.

Chapter 3
Reimagining the Church

The starting point is theological, not structural or methodological.

An institutional temple spirituality primarily oriented around church buildings,

Sunday services, programs, formalized professional clergy, or standardized denominational frameworks,

is not likely to produce a viral spiritual force of Christ followers and churches.

Only a rigorous recovery of Christology--doctrine of Christ--will revitalize Christians.

~ Roger Helland, Magnificent Surrender

But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in

Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

Acts 1:8

Let’s head back to Jerusalem to begin our theological reimagining of church. Her enemies said of the church, “…you have filled Jerusalem!13” Wouldn’t you love for that to be said about your faith movement in your city? “You have filled this city like water fills an aquarium. Everyone and everywhere is saturated!”

In the context of this book, we are currently using the term Gospel Saturation to describe such an occurrence. What is Gospel saturation? The church owning the lostness of an identified people in a defined place ensuring that every man, woman, and child has repeated opportunities to see, hear, experience in community the Gospel, and then respond to the Good News of Jesus Christ. 14

Perhaps the most compelling expression of Gospel Saturation is Paul’s consummate vision for the Church and the entire Cosmos in Ephesians 1:22-23,

And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

How big are you when everything is under you little toe? How big is Jesus?

Imagine the vastness of creation for a moment. Most of us were quarantined in a house for months during the COVID-19 pandemic. We could feel the walls closing in. So, let your imagination run wild and just envision again how vast the cosmos is.

Jim Lovell, on the Apollo 8 mission said, “We went to learn about the moon, what I really discovered was how small the earth is15.” Another astronaut Jim Irwin describe the earth as a fragile ornament hanging in the blackness of space… he said, “As we pulled father away, eventually the earth was the size of a marble…”16

Pull back a little farther.

February 14, 1990, as the Voyager 1 spacecraft left our planetary neighborhood for the fringes of the solar system, engineers turned it around for one last look at its home planet. Voyager 1 was about (4 billion miles away, and approximately 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane, when it captured a portrait of our world, now known affectionately as the Pale Blue Dot. Caught in the center of scattered light rays, Earth appears as a tiny point of light, a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size.17

Pull back a little farther.

Not just the earth, but the entire cosmos is like a speck of dust in Jesus’ hand.

Back in Genesis, Jesus is the one took the chaos, what was formless and void, and ordered it and filled. Jesus turns chaos into cosmos. His wisdom and understanding has no limit. Each of us has an image of

Jesus that hands in the gallery of our soul. We must understand how impoverished and warped the image is. It needs to be constantly reformed by the Word and by the Spirit.

Jesus is so much bigger and so much better than we imagine. In fact, Paul says that Jesus fills everything every way. He is big enough to fill every need, big enough to be the solution to every problem, big enough to redeem every mistake, big enough to restore everything broken.

Jesus is filling everything every way with all that He is. At the end of the story, Heaven and Earth will collide and comingle completely, evil will be vanquished, and all that Jesus is will fill everything everyway.

As the church, we are called to be “His body, the fullness of Him.” This tell us who we are as the church and what we are destined for.

Who are we? The church is not a building; it’s a body. It’s not a program; it’s a people. It’s not an activity; it’s an identity. We are the people of God saved by the power of God for the purposes of God. We are the body of Christ!

What are we destined for? As we join Jesus, as His body, we are called to fill everything in every way with all the Jesus is. This is the most expansive vision for church one could possibly imagine! Fill everything every way? That’s Gospel Saturation.

Let me be honest, there have been a lot of times in my past where my vision for mobilization is ,”Lord, I need you to fill the chairs in the auditorium, I need you to fill all the volunteer slots in the nursery during the third service, and the offering bags too.” The temptation for church leaders is to make the end zone of mobilization the organization of the church and its programs. If a church leader is saying, “Our Church is healthy,” …but the murder rate in our city is still high, fatherlessness is increasing, addiction is increasing, we’re not making any gains in universal flourishing in every corner of culture… Is the church in the city healthy?

Perhaps the best Biblical word for this state of being for Gospel Saturation is the word Shalom. Neal Plantinga, President of Calvin Theological Seminary, in his book, Not the Way It’s Supposed to Be described the idea as follows:

“The webbing together of God, humans, and all creation in justice, fulfillment, and delight is what the Hebrew prophets call Shalom. We call it peace, but it means far more than mere peace of mind or a cease-fire between enemies. In the Bible, Shalom means universal flourishing, wholeness, and delight — a rich state of affairs in which natural needs are satisfied and natural gifts fruitfully employed, a state of affairs that inspires joyful wonder as its Creator and Savior opens doors and welcomes the creatures in whom he delights. Shalom, in other words, is the way things ought to be.” 18

That’s the end game of the Movement Starfish: To fill everything everyway with the fullness of Jesus. We must begin with that end in mind, “What will it take to see that happen in my home, neighborhood, city, region, nation and beyond?”

That’s what began happening in Jerusalem, in short order, after the ascension of Jesus. The early church saturated the city with the good news, beauty and justice of Jesus. That leaves us with this question, “How in the world did that happen?

Multiplication is the Spirit’s means of moving us toward the fulfillment of Gospel Saturation. It is important to remember that multiplication is not an endzone in and of itself, but a means to an end. With that in mind, what are various dimensions of multiplication that yield a Starfish movement that moves us closer to Gospel Saturation in a given context?

In total, we will argue that there are at least five, as in the five points of a Starfish. We will look at these within the context of the early church first. If you’re a not a church leader but a leader from another sector of society, consider what these various points of multiplication might look like in our context.

We find the first two points of multiplication in Acts 5:4219,

Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.

How did it happen? Houses and Hub. The first two points of multiplication.

Hub, temple courts. Houses, house to house. Hub, more organized. Houses, more organic. Hub, gathered. Houses, scattered.

Hub, resources for corporate training and city-wide impact. Houses, relationships for personal training and local impact in neighborhoods and networks.

Hub, more formal. Houses, more informal.

Hub, more structured. Houses, more spontaneous. Hubs and Houses, it’s the genius of Jesus.

This Spirit-empowered church built their lives around a particular set of rhythms.

They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Acts 2:42–4520

But again, where and when did these rhythms play out? Hub and Houses.

“Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.” Acts 2:46-47 NIV21

All of it happened on a daily basis in Houses that also gathered at the Hub.

The New International Version. . (Ac 2:42-45). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

The New International Version. . (Ac 2:46-47). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

Hub and Houses. Houses and Hub.

If yours is like many faith communities, you may be thinking, “We already do this. We have small groups and weekend services.”

Keep reading. We may be talking about something categorically different.

The church in Jerusalem had a rhythm of both centralized connection at the Hub of the temple courts, and decentralized connection within the Houses.

In the temple courts, the apostles taught, performed miracles, and evangelized. In the courts, the people of God learned, worshipped, prayed and fellowship within the temple structures. Hundreds or thousands could gather in the temple courts.

In the houses, the church lived as extended spiritual families, in everyday gospel community, led by ordinary people, owning the mission of Jesus in their relational network. Let’s call them mircochurches. A couple dozen or more people could gather in the multiple-generational homes of the day, which gives us a general size for the microchurch.

The Greek word used in the New Testament for those networks is “oikos.” The gospel transformed oikos into microchurches. The oikos were the major social structure of Rome. Oikos went beyond immediate family to include extended family, household slaves, and their network of friends, neighbors, and business associates. Rodney Stark, in The Rise of Christianity, documents the exponential growth of the church from 1000 in 40 AD to over 33,000,000 by 350 AD, crediting the simple church strategy.22

Michael Green, author of Evangelism in the Early Church, proclaims the central nature of oikos. Oikos, “consisting of blood relations, slaves, clients, and friends, was one of the bastions of the Greco-Roman society. Christians…made a deliberate point of gaining…households as lighthouses…from which the Gospel could illuminate the surrounding darkness.”23

Dan White Jr, in his book Subterranean: Why the Future of the Church is Rootedness, proclaims, “The oikos is the imperfect, messy, relational, organic but organized amoeba of the firstcentury church. Oikos was the hot mess of God’s in-breaking kingdom that supported early Christians for mission in a city, for maturing in love, for the practice of the Eucharist, for the collision of racial diversity, for resistance to paganism, and for being shaped as disciples.”24

The microchurches set entire oikos ablaze with the grace of God, like yeast in the dough gradually spreading and elevating an entire relational network with the gospel. By now, you might be sensing how different this is from what most churches call small groups. Unlike traditional small groups, microchurches are a pure missionary endeavor, where the gospel is planted into a network or neighborhood, new disciples emerge and form a new community. These groups are very proximate and incarnational in that neighborhood or network, unlike traditional small groups, that usually have people

coming in from many networks and neighborhoods, who are being organized into groups by professionals. Because they are embedded into a particular neighborhood or network of relationships, daily discipleship and gospel community becomes the norm. This is vastly different from most small groups, which typical are formed for assimilation and deliver of content to churchgoers.

In Acts 12:12, we are told that one of these mircochurches met in the house of Mary. The church in Jerusalem was a starfish network of microchurches, who also gathered at hub of the Temple. Those microchurches began to fill the neighborhoods of Jerusalem with disciples of Jesus. The gatherings at the hub where catalytic and empowering to the houses. The combination of multiplying disciples and microchurches (Houses), equipped by apostolic leadership and teaching in the temple courts (Hub), is what filled the city of Jerusalem.

But don’t miss this, the starfish network of microchurches was primary. How do we know that?

“And Saul approved of their killing him. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.” Acts 8:1 NIV25

In Acts 8:1, following the martyrdom of Stephen, the church is persecuted, and the public gatherings at the temple courts are shut down. Right at the point that the church ceased functioning because the Hub gathering wasn’t available. WRONG! The church continued to multiply disciples at an increasing rate across the Roman Empire. How did that primarily happen? Houses.

Look for the word that is repeated in the next three passages. See if you can find the pattern.

One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message. When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. "If you consider me a believer in the Lord," she said, "come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us. Acts 16:14-15 (NIV)26

Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized.

Acts 16:32-33 (NIV)27

Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized. Acts 18:7-8 (NIV)

What is the word that was repeated in all three passages?

The word that keeps occurring is ‘household.’ The Book of Acts records clearly how the gospel spread from one household to another, with many of these households being specifically named. We can see the microchurch starfish networks clearly by turning to the end of almost any of the epistles to specific cities. As gospel spreads, these starfish networks of microchurches, would form in a city.

The New International Version. . (Ac 16:14-15). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

The New International Version. . (Ac 18:7-8). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

Romans is a classic example, where in chapter 16 Paul addresses different microchurches meeting in different households, including Priscilla and Aquila, the household of Aristobulus, the household of Narcissus, and so on. Leading NT scholar James Dunn comments on Romans 16, that these groupings indicate at least five different microchurches in Rome. The same is true of the Laodicean church, which apparently gathered in various places, with Paul needing to give a greeting to a specific group meeting in the house of Nympha (Col 4:15). Also consider the possibility of what could have been happening in Corinth, where the houses of Titius Justice (Acts 18:7), the household of Crispus (Acts 18:8), and the house of Stephanas (1 Corinthians 16:5) are all mentioned. Yet, Paul says “the whole church” comes together (1 Corinthians 14:23). Sounds like a Hub.

That microchurch framework makes sense of virtually all the instructions given in the epistles. The “one another” commands about community can be best fleshed out within a microchurch. When it comes to worship instructions, “When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation, (1 Cor 14:26)” Paul was envisioning a microchurch where everyone in the room could participate, not a large corporate worship services with hundreds or thousands.

When the church could pull together the households into a corporate gathering, they did. At the beginning of Acts, the church had a Hub in the temple courts. At the end of Acts, Paul is using the Hall of Tyrannus (Acts 19:10) as a Hub. Antioch, without a doubt, became a Hub, a place for equipping and launching of missionaries, before Ephesus. This larger corporate expression had a huge impact on the city of Jerusalem and the church in Ephesus. It provided inspiration, momentum, celebration, teaching, and a shared identity as the church in a city. There were apostolic leaders who provided oversight over all the microchurches, people like James and Peter in the Jerusalem and Paul, Timothy, plus Priscilla and Aquila in Ephesus28.

Houses and Hubs! Long live the Starfish Church!

But, in our world, autonomous, independent, Spider churches dominate the landscape. The driving question is usually, “How can I grow my church?” We’re obsessed with the spider expression of the Church. Yet, in the New Testament, we see the microchurches in the home, in the city, and in the region, working as one church, a Starfish faith movement, with multiple leaders and elder teams, interdependently networked as a Body. The driving question here is, “How can we multiply the number of people entering and experiencing the Kingdom, and the influence of the Kingdom, regardless of who gets the credit or increase?”

Imagine our cities being filled the life of Heaven here on earth.

Imagine developing a missionary on every street and a microchurch in every neighborhood or network of relationships.

Imagine if every street had at least two people who said, “I will BLESS the people on this street! I will begin in prayer for each neighbor. I will listen deeply to the story of my neighbors and my neighborhood. I will eat with them. I will serve them. I will share the Good News.”

The art of neighboring would be restored! New community would be created. That community would liberate our neighborhoods and networks from the loneliness, isolation and superficiality they are trapped in. Then, that community, like a bud breaking through the earth, would eventually blossom into a microchurch.

Imagine what it would be like if a spiritual extended family owned the mission of Jesus in every neighborhood and network in your city. That kind of movement would be present enough, deep enough, and personal enough to actually transform both the spiritual landscape and the culture of a city, of your city. Imagine, the gathered church as a collection of those many microchurches, a Hub for equipping, evangelism and sending. Imagine those Hubs multiplying into networks, working toward Gospel Saturation in a city. That’s the story of the early church.

As mentioned earlier, we will offer seven different versions of the Starfish, as a portable way to carry the core content. The first is the Movement Starfish, which will help us reimagine the Church as a decentralized network.

# The Movement Starfish

Five Points of Multiplication

Multiplying Disciples (Owners of the Faith)

The Starfish begins with disciples multiplying disciples. The critical starting point of any faith movement is flourishing and reproducing owners of the faith.

Multiplying Leaders (Those Who Have Multiplied Owners of the Faith)

As people begin to multiply disciples, they are becoming leaders almost without knowing it. As we multiply disciples and leaders, we get teams. The missional teams own the mission of Jesus in a neighborhood or network, then become the core for mircochurches (Houses).

Multiplying Houses (Microchurches, Missional Teams, etc.)

In my tradition, microchurches are spiritual extended families, living in everyday gospel community, led by ordinary people, who own the mission of Jesus in a neighborhood or social network. Some call them missional communities or organic churches. As we multiply missional teams and microchurches, we start filling neighborhoods and networks. In terms of size, these usually range in size from 12-50 people, who can meet in homes and live in daily gospel community.

Multiplying Hubs (Centralized Expressions of Church That Equip for Disciple-Making, Leadership Development and the Flourishing of the Houses)

Those microchurches connect with Hubs, so we can be the church gathered and scattered, like in the book of Acts. This may be a preexisting Church or, perhaps, the four or five microchurches come together to as a new congregation, that exists to equip the movement of missionaries and microchurches. In our context, as we continue to multiply Hubs by starting new churches or the reformation of pre-existing organized churches into Hubs, those reproducing Hubs become networks. We will do a deeper dive on Hubs a little later in this chapter, as we believe this is the point of multiplication that requires more effort to bring clarity on what true purpose of a Hub is.

Multiplying Networks (2 or more Interdependent Churches Intentionally Working Together on Mission)

A network consists of two or more churches working together in a city or region around a shared Kingdom mission. This may be microchurches or larger congregations, connected and working together around the Jesus Mission. Most cities will require multiple networks working together on different areas of mission like best practices in disciple-making, church planting, social justice, business as mission, prayer, poverty and the like to reach the goal of Gospel Saturation in a city. Those networks must remember, that at the end of the day, the most important function is multiplying disciples, not just planting churches or addressing social justice issues. If they want to a movement that can fill a city, it rises and falls with the ability to make disciples who can make disciples. 29

If you’re faith leader from another sector of society, or perhaps a leader of a non-profit, ask yourself, “What are these five points of multiplication in my context?” Perhaps, you can swap out the “microchurch” language for “working teams” and “hubs” for “HR department.” Regardless of your context, the mindset is the same, you need reproduction at all five points of the Starfish, if you want to be a decentralized faith movement.

Before we look at the goal of each of these five points of multiplication, let’s drill a little deeper in on the concept of a Hub, as that will be the area where we maybe be most tempted to take what is currently being done in our church and relabel it a “Hub,” without making any significant changes.

A Word of Clarity on the Function of Hubs as Revealed by the Coronavirus.

As I write this, 3/4th’s of the American population is under a “shelter in place” order. My family is quarantined at home. We’ve all been blindsided by the Coronavirus. The whole world feels as if it’s changed overnight. With hundreds of millions of people on lockdown, how do we mobilize God’s people when folks can’t leave their homes and social distancing keeps us “out of reach” to one another?

In the coming months, with this pandemic, churches around this country will find that they are no longer able to offer weekend services or any other type of large gathering without putting people at a significant risk. I’ve spent most of my adult life as a pastor in very large churches, so I understand this scenario has turned over the apple cart.

Currently, we have launched a crisis coaching initiative. More than 1500 church leaders joined in a matter of days. I share this only to demonstrate the need church leaders are feeling for clarity on the church’s response in this unprecedented catastrophe. In these cohorts, you can feel the immense fear, anxiety, and uncertainty bubbling in the hearts of leaders, who are genuinely wondering, “Will my church survive this?”

While I was serving as a pastor at a large church in Northern Indiana, that leadership team had a few occasions where we had to cancel weekend services due to severe weather. We used to live in what was known as the Snow Belt, where lake effect snow off of Lake Michigan could dump 6-8 feet of snow during a winter season. Worst case scenario: Canceling services two weeks in a row. We operated with a minimum of a three-week cushion, so the threat was minimized.

Churches navigating the Coronavirus pandemic are looking at the possibility of not being able to have public services for weeks, maybe months. That’s a sobering situation, which may feel like an existential threat because of how the centralized church is structured. This is where we can begin to discover new clarity on what it means to be a Hub. When we say Hub, we must understand that it is not equivalent to the centralized form of church.

This is where opening the hood on the Underground approach, initiated by the Tampa Underground, which we are innovating off of in Kansas City, will be helpful.

IN KC Underground, we function with a two-entity structure, a mission agency and a network of microchurches. Our mission agency, our definition of a Hub, equips normal folks to be loving missionaries and effective disciple-makers in new contexts. We have seven teams that make up the service platform to equip and launch missionaries who plant the gospel. As new disciples are made in a new context, a microchurch emerges. At that point, you have an extended spiritual family on your hands. Our definition of a microchurch is this: An extended spiritual family, that is led by ordinary people, seeks to live in everyday gospel community, that owns the mission of Jesus in a network of relationships.

When we have 4-6 microchurches in a geographic region or affinity group, we network them together in what we call Collectives. Collectives have shared elders, mission, and resources.

The Hubs support the missionaries, microchurches, and collectives. We currently have one Hub in our city but envision a day where we will have 12 or more throughout the city. A Hub does have a physical location, an office that services as co-working space for the missionaries and microchurch leaders, as well as for, the seven equipping teams. In a city of 2.2 million, we want every missionary and microchurch leader to have easy access to a Hub, with its services and support proximate to them.

We are attempting to reimagine church as a decentralized network.

When the Coronavirus hit, by God’s grace we were able to pivot quickly. I knew I needed to write a letter to our microchurch leaders and the faithful missionaries in our movement to keep them abreast on our response to this crisis. As I wrote that letter, I realized that the form of church we equip for, the microchurch, is perfectly positioned for this type of culture moment.

My letter became less of a warning about what we “can’t do” anymore, and more of a rally cry for all the things we “can do” as a movement of microchurches. We quickly gave free access to a video conferencing platform to all our microchurches. All the microchurches leaned in, dramatically increased both frequency of community touches and community depth, as they rallied as spiritual extended families. Secondly, the Hub increased activity and equipping because it’s not bound by a building or service in a particular location. For example, the Hub offers a weekly equipping gathering for all the missionaries and microchurch leaders. This is not a weekend service, but a combination of inspiration, story-telling, and practical equipping for leaders. It’s very conversational and interactive. We moved that gathering online immediately and saw an increase in attendance and participation. The liminal space of the crisis catalyzed creativity and new initiatives through our microchurch leaders as they shared their ideas. They don’t need us to tell them what to do.

For example, a number of our missionaries immediately launched new online Discovery Bible Studies, inviting new people from their neighborhoods and networks to join them to find community and comfort in the storm. New disciples of Jesus have begun to emerge immediately. We’ve seen two new microchurches emerge in the last two weeks of the crisis! This is actually accelerating us in mission.

95% of our giving is online, as we don’t collect offerings in microchurches, and as I am writing this, six weeks into the pandemic, we’ve not seen a dip in giving, as of yet.

The church as a decentralized network is almost invulnerable to any pandemic or crisis. Historian Rodney Stark, in his book The Rise of Christianity, notes that the pandemics that caused social chaos in the Empire in the early days of the church actually fueled both the viral growth of the church and the depth of community in the households of faith, what we call microchurches. As others abandoned family or friends and bunkered down in fear, the households of faith led by ordinary people engaged the sick and the suffering. Their communal love and witness convinced the world that the Good News of Jesus was real and for everyone.

May this be our story in these coming days!

The fact of the matter, whether church leaders wanted it or not, when the pandemic hit, they were forced to reimagine their church as a decentralized network of disciples and micro expressions of the church. We know theologically, the church is not a building, it’s a body. The church is nor place or program, it’s a people. It’s not an event, but everyday people living out the mission of Jesus in every area of life and everywhere they go.

But the COVID-19 Crisis made us experience those ideas literally. Yes, the church has buildings, places, programs and events. But we don’t have to have those. They don’t define us. The Church is not an activity, but an Identity. Now, that those “tools” have been removed; we are forced to reimagine what the Church is without those things.

A centralized church builds upon the centralizing elements of a building, an event, a program, or a highly gifted teacher. Decentralized church builds around network of multiplying disciples, leaders and micro expressions in multiple locations. What the corona virus revealed is how very vulnerable the centralized form of church is. Our buildings, programs and events were wiped off the board in a matter of days.

In the first few weeks of the crisis, many church leaders scrambled to move their services online or to upgrade the online experience as the most important strategy because that is essential for the centralized form of church. I’m for having “the voice” of the church being broadcast to her people. And yet, if done without reflection, as an end in and of itself, we are still using the same rubric of “centralized delivery of religious goods and services” as our main strategy. That play will still leave us vulnerable and far from the movemental form of church. “The medium is the message,” as the saying goes.

In the crisis coaching, we emphasized a different response. First, we offered two theological reminders the Church rests on. Then, we encouraged two priority pivots for action.

Reminder #1: Our God is Unchanging. Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. Heaven is not panicked, neither should we be. Jesus is seated on His throne. He’s not up pacing back and forth. He is seated on His throne and because of that our foundation is joy and shalom. He will lead us through this together, as we listen to His voice and obey. So, begin with prayer, fasting, and repentance. May we will only go forward as fast as we can on our knees, in totally God-dependency. Put the oxygen mask on yourself first, breathe in the Gospel and quiet yourself in His presence.

Reminder #2: Our mission is Unchanging. Make disciples who make disciples. This crisis environment is actually a richer environment for disciple-making because people are living with a real awareness of eternal realities. For example, we are always hanging on a thread between life and death. But most of the time we can ignore it. Not anymore. Most of time, we live with the illusion of control. Not anymore. Most of the time, we can distract ourselves and keep ourselves busy, but no longer. The desperate need for authentic community will be so palpable in lockdown.

I saw a picture on Instagram of a pastor who was going to buy supplies. Of course, half the shelves were empty. But you know what he else he noticed? He had posted a picture of the book section of Walmart where the Bibles are. All of them were gone. Not one left. That reveals the unparalleled hunger for spiritual truth during this pandemic. Thus far, this the most potent opportunity for disciplemaking in our lifetime! So, how do we leverage this opportunity.

Priority #1: Pivot to small groups (starfish) harder than you pivot to streaming services. More than great content, what people need right now is great community.

As helpful as streaming services is, what people need the most in a crisis isn’t more great content (there’s a glut of great content already), but great Jesus-centered community to sustain them. The second wave of response that is now beginning to unfold, is a great effort to move whatever form of micro a church has (small groups, life groups, etc.) online to videoconferencing platforms like zoom. That’s brilliant.

Reimagine church as a decentralized network of micro expressions of church.

Years ago, I remember hearing Alan Hirsch share a chess analogy that is so pertinent today. If you want to learn how to play chess, you should start by removing your own queen. Once you’ve mastered the game without the most powerful piece, then put the queen back in and see how good you are! Alan says, for the church, the Sunday service in a building is our queen. We’ve been relying on it too much.

Now that the queen has been taken off the board it’s time to rediscover what all the other pieces can do.

The Harvest is ready to be brought into the barns. The fish are jumping into the boat. But the barns and the boats are not your church building. They are not your online streaming services. The barns and the boats are those micro-expressions of the church, the small groups where people can truly be a part of the family of God, in an embodied way (and for now), even in a virtual space.

Priority #2: Pivot to current staff to equipping the leaders that lead those micro-expressions.

As I mentioned earlier, in the Underground, we offer a weekly equipping gathering for the leaders of the microchurches. We moved that equipping gathering online seamlessly, where they get in working huddles in breakout rooms. That’s a virtual recreation of what we had been doing when we met in one location. In addition, every microchurch leader in our movement has a coach. Our coaches are increasing their connection with those leaders. All seven of our equipping teams, because they are built on a coaching model, can operate at 100% capacity, totally unhindered in this crisis.

Wise church leaders are realizing, “The staff I had to support all the centralized programs and services of the church now have to be redeployed to become coaches to equip those who are leading these micro expressions! That’s job one!”

When crisis hits, we find out what is essential. If this crisis is forcing the prevailing model to reorganize to prioritize smaller groups, emphasize equipping and leadership development, and the decentralizing of power, giving and mission as essential. Then, perhaps, micro and equipping toward that end is the most essential expression of church all the time.

That leads to the real purpose of a Hub: equipping ordinary people to be loving missionaries, effective disciple-makers and spiritual parents of microchurches. If you consider what was really happening with the apostolic influence in the Temple Courts and Hall of Tyrannus, do you think it was people gathering to consume a Christian Ted talk, sing a few songs, and then rinse and repeat next week? Or, in fact, did Paul use that Hall to equip missionary disciple-makers who spread out all over that region of the Roman Empire to plant the gospel and see new microchurches and networks emerge?

The answer is in the Book, for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.

Hubs can be independent of congregations, like they are in the KC Underground. Our Collectives (networks of microchurches) operate like congregations with shared worship gatherings (1-2 per month) and shared leadership. The Hubs support the Collectives by equipping the missionaries and microchurches within them. We are more at the Starfish end of the continuum, a Starder.

Or Hubs can exist within a larger organized expression of Church. Those within the prevailing model can transition by creating a new “mission agency” inside the church and make that an essential part of their framework. That would be more at the Spider end of the continuum, a Spiderfish.

I think we need both to get the job done. Either way, we can equip to see multiplication happening at all five points: Disciples, Leaders, House, Hubs, and Networks. Let’s look now to see what exactly we mean by movement.

Movement is one of the latest buzzwords in church leadership world. Now, everything is a movement. When everything is a movement, then nothing is a movement. Words matter. Definitions matters. In one sense, a movement is anything that moves. We get that.

However, we are seeking to ground the Movement Starfish definition in the more than forty years of analysis of the greatest movements in the history of church that have occurred in our lifetime. These Disciple-Making Movements (DMM) and Church Planting Movements (CPM) have been documented and researched in such seminal works as Church Planting Movements by David Garrison or Miraculous Movements by Jerry Trousdale, along with the work of David Watson through Cityteam and then New Generations, who has been instrumental in starting over 100 DMM’s globally through his training of local leaders. It would seem foolish to ignore the clear definition for movement that has emerged from the CPM and DMM world, where we can learn from the church in her finest expression around the world.

In his book, Garrison defines it in the following way,

A CPM is a rapid and multiplicative increase of indigenous churches planting churches within a given people group or population segment.30

Three key points to note:

It’s rapid and viral. Momentum grows and appear out of control.

It’s multiplicative, not growth by addition.

It’s indigenous. The church planting doesn’t occur because outsiders come in (although they may be catalytic in the early stages) but because local, indigenous people are making new disciples that form new churches.

This indigenous movements start with extraordinary prayer and fasting, focus on obedience-based discipleship, discovery forms of Bible engagement, passionate and fearless sharing of the Gospel, authority is decentralized so finding the “top leader” feels impossible, and the form of church is small, simple and easy to produce.

It’s further defined by David Watson as having at least 100 churches, at least three generations deep31.

How do DMM’s and CPM’s relate? Roy Moran, another fellow Kansas City native, who is a mentor and a recognized expert on both, provides this answer, “The term disciple making movements…is what started the process. While Garrison was describing the result – planting churches – the New Generations tribe preferred to describe the process – disciple making. Multiplying churches was the result.”32

A great many people have co-opted the labels, Church Planting Movements and Disciple-Making Movements, redefining them in any which way that serves them. The authors desire is to build on the foundation of these hard-fought, well-founded definitions.

The Goal of Movement Starfish: Four Generations of Reproduction on Multiple Strands at All Five Points.

The goal in each of these aspects of the Movement Starfish– disciples, leaders, houses, hubs, and networks – is reproduction to the fourth generation and beyond, on more than one strand.

And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others. 2 Timothy 2:2

Paul (Generation 1) to Timothy (Generation 2) to Reliable People (Generation 3) to Others (Generation 4). Since we are all called to be disciples who make disciples, that means every disciple is called to initiate more than one strand of four generation multiplication.

In the illustration to the right, you can see what a four generation on multiple strand disciplemaking movement looks like. When we see four generations of reproduction on multiple strands in each of these areas – disciples, leaders, houses, hubs, and networks, you have a genuine movement on your hands. The good things are officially running wild.

Jesus’ plan from the very beginning: Reproduce at every level. If we keep reproducing at every level consistently, eventually we get to multiplication. Multiplication will produce an unstoppable, transforming faith movement in your city and region.

Here in Kansas City, we are working on

environments and tools for multiplication for each on these points of the Movement Starfish. We will explore those with the Owner-Making Ingredient Starfish and the Owner-Making Ecosystem Starfish in the second half of the book. We’ll share the story of one Disciple-Making Movement from our city that has multiplied disciples out past the fourth, fifth and sixth generation on multiple strands, more than four thousand people. It’s all life on life, grassroots, bottom-up. We are encouraged to see more examples emerging in the West in our day

Cory Ozbun, my friend and partner in the KC Underground, who is a such a catalytic leader in our city, describes the journey toward the Movement Starfish this way – First, mindset. Next, momentum. Then, Movement. It starts with the right mindset: Multiply Disciples with the Vision of Gospel Saturation.

Then, as disciple make disciples, eventually leaders and microchurches multiply, with Hubs and Networks following in suit. If things are moving that way, but you’ve not yet reached four generations on multiple strands, you have momentum. Momentum is good! For example, we saw a 400% increase in microchurches this last year in the KC Underground, most of that was by multiplication, along with a few adoptions. By God’s grace, that’s momentum! But we’re not a movement yet, not until we hit four generations on multiple strands, with a holistic vision of all five points of multiplication.

We believe that the Movement Starfish is not just meant for national church planting movements or large networks like NewThing, Acts 29, ARC, and the like. This kind of movement always starts with a handful of disciples. In other words, you and your friends could be the catalyst for a Starfish movement. A small or medium-sized congregation could be unleashed this way with the right kind of leadership.

Using a dated metaphor from my teen years, this is an “all skate.” Everyone gets to play. Large faith organizations could be reimagined this way. As nature has shown us, evolution is necessary to change from a Spider to a Starfish. Adaptive changes can create new forms.

This brings us to the hybrids again: Spiderfish and Starders.
There are two types of hybrids: The Spiderfish and the Starder.

The first type of hybrid, the Spiderfish, is a more centralized institution that decentralizes parts of their organization. They will lean more heavily into centralization of staffing, teaching, resources, but are willing to decentralize certain aspects like local or global missions or microchurches.

The second type of hybrid, the Starder, is a more decentralized approach that centralizes as little as they deem necessary in the pursuit of gospel saturation in a city or region.

By far, the most practical and helpful outworking of these hybrid approaches within the context of the evangelical church in America that we have seen are described in MultiChurch: Exploring the Future of Multisite by Brad House and Gregg Allison. You’ll see how their Multisite/Multichurch Spectrum overlaps perfectly with our Spider/Starfish Continuum. Those authors have provided a clear vocabulary for us to be able to describe the journey from centralized expressions of church to decentralized expressions of church.
In simple terms, a multichurch is one church made up of multiple interdependent churches. These churches have a form of polity, or locus of power, that provides the opportunity and authority to make decentralized decisions about budget, contextualization of ministries, leadership and more. A multichurch is a network of disciples who multiply their influence by launching, developing, and resourcing a network of multiple congregations to reach its city with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Whereas, a multisite approach is typically one church with multiple locations and services, but locus of power leans toward centralization of budgets, branding, decision-making, and the like.33

As you can see there are seven different models along the spectrum: Pillar: One church with a single service

Gallery: One church expanded to multiple services and/or venues. Franchise: One church cloned to multiple sites.

Federation: One church contextualized in multiple locations. Cooperative: One church made up of multiple interdependent churches. Collective: A collection of churches collaborating as one church.

Network: Individual churches joining together for a common goal and support.

This book is designed for leaders who finds themselves drawn toward the middle of the continuum, with a strong gravitational pull towards the Starfish end the continuum. If you find yourself in a Pillar or Gallery, but you’d love to get to the Spiderfish territory of the Federation model, keep reading. If, right now, you find yourself leading a Franchise model, but the Spirit is leading you to Starder territory, by moving to a Federation model next, and perhaps, a Cooperative model after that, we hope to be helpful guides. If you’re a church planter, and you already know that God has placed a vision in your heart for a Collective, then it is our great hope that this book, by God’s grace, will shorten your learning curve and speed up your timeline. The remainder of the book will provide ways of thinking and practical tools, each encapsulated in a different starfish, that will move faith communities toward the decentralized end of the continuum. As with all sustained change, before we can talk about structural reformation in the church you lead, we need to speak first to personal reformation in the soul and life of the leader. Let’s first discover what it means to be the Light Load Leader.

# Section Two A Culture
Chapter 4

The Light Load Leader Starfish

Distributing the Weight

Life at the top of the pyramids isn’t much more fulfilling. Behind the facade and the bravado, the lives of powerful corporate leaders are ones of quiet suffering too.

–Frederic Laloux

Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”

–Matt. 11:28-30 (ESV)

Meeting at a local coffee shop, I (Lance) and Steven, the founding pastor of a church that had grown to around 1100 members, sat down to discuss the discontent the young pastor was experiencing after over a decade of leading the church he started. “I can’t really pinpoint what it is that I am feeling,” Steven said. “Don’t get me wrong. I love our church and I’m not looking to move on. But I am just so weary of the weight and pace of carrying this thing. Something seems off.”

Over the next couple of hours Lance asked Steven to give an overview of how day-to-day workflow and responsibilities were carried out—the way the church was governed, and the methods accountability and authority was practiced among the staff. Next he had Steven draw the church’s organizational structure with the names and titles of those involved. The result was a classic pyramid leadership chart. At one-point Lance spun the sketch 180 degrees. “All that weight is on the point, Steven. You’re the point. And you are the point because so much points toward you. That’s a lot of weight on your shoulders,” Lance said, before steering the conversation to a prophetic promise of the coming messiah:

For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

Isaiah 9:6. (ESV)

Steven pushed back from the table and sighed deeply, “Wow, that sounds so refreshing and hopeful.” Like that worn out young pastor, just imagine the momentous value this familiar verse can bring if we stop limiting it to glittery Christmas cards and cantatas but allow it to shape and inform our leadership approach. It is a promise!

First off, the weight of governing rests on the triune Godhead of the Holy Spirit (counselor), Father, and Son (Prince of Peace). The weight of leadership rests there. And our leadership role opens up to God’s counsel, might, and peace. The government shall be upon his shoulder.

There are two ways you can live. One, you live like Atlas and exhaust your soul. Remember the old myth of Atlas? What did he carry on his shoulders? The weight of the world. As you read this, to what degree to you feel that weight on your shoulders?

There is another way to live. Jesus describes the second option, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” Matthew

11:28-30

How good does that sound? That’s what we need! The way of the Light Load Leader. When Jesus says, “Take my yoke,” he’s saying, “Let me train you, so your soul is light as a feather, fluid as water, deep as the ocean, and strong as mighty oak.”

Way too many leaders believe that the weight of the world is to be upon their shoulders. For example, hear what Seattle pastor Eugene Cho shared with the congregation he led for 18 years during his announcement of resignation: “I’ve not been able to honor my responsibilities as Lead Pastor. As a result, some of that burden has trickled down to some of the other pastors, which simply isn’t fair to them, our staff, or frankly, the church. The church needs a lead pastor that can be fully invested and drive the vision and mission of the church.” We are not called to be Atlas.

So how might we ensure that the leadership (government) of our organizations rest upon His shoulder?

Macro-management over Micro-management

First, picture a system of macro-management whereby the responsibility of self-managing is distributed to every individual rather than a micro-management system of superiors in pockets of the organization. Some wonderful pointers are hidden in plain sight within the Bible. In his letter to the church at Philippi the apostle Paul speaks of his companions as fellow workers. The word is also translated as “yokefellow” This is a term that expresses collegiality, camaraderie, and partnership. Yokefellow harkens to the tool used to join two oxen in unison. A yoke was a simple mechanism made from a pole with two side-byside U-shaped devices that fit over the necks of the oxen. The word in Greek means, “to pull together in harness.”

To call someone your yokefellow is to say, “We are in this thing together, shoulder to shoulder. We may have differing strengths, but we are both just a couple of oxen whose reins are in the hands of the same Master.” Jesus says, “Take my yoke upon you...” Paul uses the language that helps us take Jesus’ yoke. The promise is: “You will find rest for your souls.”

Four Signs of Micromanagement

Delegation doesn’t happen. Micromanagers can’t believe others can do the job, so they do it themselves.

Over-reporting is required. Everyone must make periodic reports. Micromanagers make it seem like reporting is the job.

No power to make decisions. Team members feel like the smallest task may require a sign off.

The hoarding of skills and knowledge. Micromanagers see knowledge and skill as their currency, so sharing it means they feel they will lose value.1

When we view church and faith-based organizations as a typical business, we end up viewing those who should be our yokefellows and peers as employees and subordinates. As we will show later, this is not to say that everyone has the same role or ability. Different giftings and talents equip us all for different roles. What causes us to go off the rails—through the sin of lording over others—is the tendency to rank the rarer gifts and talents of a few servants above the more common gifts and talents held by others. We will touch on how this plays out in Starfish leadership later in the book.

We are not claiming that starfish leadership is completely stress-free, but we are confident it sets us free from many of the stresses and burdens currently associated with leadership, as we’ve

known it. By its very design modern leadership particularly has factors that make it hard in ways it doesn’t have to be. If you have ever watched a spider build a web it looks like a pretty hard, complex, and lonely endeavor, something that is often said about leadership. Though bullies and jerks certainly exist, and we have had our own share of experiences with them, this book isn’t about focusing on the villains and tyrants. Like Steven, the vast majority of leaders in faith-based organizations we have encountered, even when they are leading in spider practices, are good and sincere people who are just doing the best they can with what they know.

Equipping over Directing

Take a few minutes to think through the things that stress you out as a leader or one who is or has been under leadership. What is the root source of most of the stress? Where does the pressure come from? For most leaders, stress comes from the pressure to produce results. We call it “the bottom line” or “the main thing.” First off, we must make sure we know what our main thing is. We must make sure we have

kept to the main thing. In doing so it is vital for us to use only the tools and methods that correspond with what we are seeking to produce. Blowtorches and sledgehammers are not seen in gardens.

The Pathway Toward MacroManagement and Equipping

Delegation is an art. Jesus walked with his disciples incrementally. Delegation is a leadership development process, not a product.

The goal is to replace yourself and to develop others to their maximum influence, while maintaining clarity and increasing authority along the way.

Level 1: Do exactly what I have asked you to do. Don’t deviate from my instructions. I have already researched the options and determined what I want you to do.

Level 2: Research the topic and report back. We will discuss it, and then I will make the decision and tell you what I want you to do.

Level 3: Research the topic, outline the options, and make a recommendation. Give me the pros and cons of each option but tell me what you think we should do. If I agree with your decision, I will authorize you to move forward.

Level 4: Make a decision and then tell me what you did. I trust you to do the research, make the best decision you can, and then keep me in the loop. I don’t want to be surprised by someone else.

Level 5: Make whatever decision you think is best. No need to report back. I trust you completely. I know you will follow through. You have my full support.1

The Art of Delegation by Gavin Adams

A seminal mistake of man-made leadership systems is the creation of organizational cultures whereby leaders excessively rely upon the power of:

Titles and rank (under the

guise of “authority”)

Human charisma and personality (under the guise of “alpha leader”)

Human stamina (under the guise of “work ethic”)

Human technique (under the guise of “ingenuity”)

So, we must ask ourselves if our primary leadership stress comes from the task or challenges of the initiatives themselves or if it is related to one or more of the bullet points above.

Being a spider leader or caught in the

web of a spider leader who operates from these powers alone creates a

weighty burden that is unsustainable over time. It shuts down the spirit in the majority of our coworkers and leaves little room for the Spirit of God to guide and speak to us, and to do the heavy lifting necessary to bring about the wins we are looking for. The end game too often is crash and burn stories whereby leaders flame out

through narcissistically driven habits. The organization ultimately can’t take it anymore and confronts the leader directly or credible accusations eventually surface to force the leader into stepping down or being removed. Other scenarios play out with a leader that burns out or succumbs to addictions of one sort or another.

Besides being way less productive, this leaderosis drives us in unnecessary, unhealthy, and less lifegiving ways for everyone. It is soul crushing, requiring an enormous effort to keep the leader persona propped up. If you have watched the classic movie The Wizard of Oz, you will remember near the end of the film that Dorothy’s little dog Toto pulls the green curtain back on the “powerful” Wizard. Come to find out he is he is just a little man with a big microphone who operates pulleys and levers. In the end he is powerless and harmless. All along he has reduced himself into playing a cheapened role that falls way short of who he was made to be. As the scene unfolds the Wizard is at first startled to be exposed but quickly is clearly relieved to get out from behind the curtain. And then something incredible takes place. He becomes who he was meant to be all along.

Leaving behind command and control the Wizard transforms into an equipper and encourager, a phenomenal leader! A new authentic confidence and strength emerges. The former Wizard helps the Scarecrow see his own untapped potential and get the brain he has longed for. He transforms the cowardly lion into a full-fledged member of the Legion of Courage and helps the Tin Man understand the importance of love and what makes a heart what it is meant to be. Leaving behind the role of commander and controller the little man steps into the joy of being himself and starts changing lives for the better!

Partnering over Paternalism

Much of what keeps us as leaders from experiencing the easy yoke and light burden Jesus offered can be traced to a basic but misguided assumption that organizations are machines and most people lack the necessary self-discipline and acumen to carry out their tasks. It creates Wizard roles whereby otherwise gifted and good-hearted equippers and mentors are reduced to lever pulling controllers with volume-enhanced voices.

This mode of organizational management was designed within and for the industrial age. It came from the need for prediction and precision through engineering and architecture, delivering products forged from cold hard steel. Assembly line workers were measured with clocks and quotas. They were constantly hovered over by the lingering eye of the shift boss in an open windowed upper office on the factory floor. The conflict is that our faith communities are not factories. They are more so gardens.

They are not full of robots. They are families. Margaret Wheatley writes,

“The tension of our times is that we want our organizations to behave as living systems, but we only know how to treat them as machines. It is time to change the way we think about organizations. Organizations are living systems. All living systems have the capacity to selforganize, to sustain themselves and move toward greater complexity and order as needed.”34

We have discovered a vast number of organizations, both for profit and non-profit, that have grown phenomenally successful endeavors by structuring themselves in non-hierarchical ways. Companies such as Morning Star, founded in 1970, which dominates the tomato processing and transport space in the United States. If you have indulged in pizza, spaghetti, or just about any other meal with a tomato paste ingredient it is almost certain you have tasted their product. This is a company that operates sans human bosses and hierarchy. It is organized through shared principles and self-management and held together by its “principles, mission, processes and a culture of learning and coaching.”35

Or consider Resources for Human Development, an almost 50-year-old Philadelphia-based non-profit with over 4,500 staff members focusing on a series of needs such as homelessness, addiction recovery, and mental disabilities. They provide over $200 million to tens of thousands of people across 14 states. RHD is built on a system of self-management and a safe and open environment where information is shared freely, early, and often. If non-faith-based organizations can operate in such ways it is more than reasonable to imagine churches and other faith organizations can function likewise.

Particularly for those in North America, the American work ethic has played a major role in shaping leadership ideology. Many faith organizations have unwittingly imported the HR manuals of corporate

America straight into their day-to-day workforce policy. We have let systems that make no claim whatsoever of being informed by the Word and Spirit of God to set the rules for us. Earthy thinking never creates heavenly results. Most of the earthy leadership thinking of our day creates paternalistic cultures.

Take this typical example from a member on staff at a large southern church. Dan was an exceptionally competent and productive leader of an entire sector of the church. He asked to take a day off to take his college freshman son to move into his new dorm. Dan was told he would have to use one of his vacation days in order to take the day off. It was all referred to policy. But no one stopped and asked, “Why do we have such policies?” “Where did we get this policy?” First off, the time Dan spent for the church was far beyond a 40-hour workweek. Anyone who has served on a church staff knows that work does not stay at the office once you leave for home. Yet, this capable adult was required to ask permission from the Executive Pastor for a “day off.” Second, like a child going to a parent Dan was required to get permission for something the one he was asking permission of would not have had to ask permission of anyone to do the same thing. The EP and Senior Pastor were the only ones allowed to set their own schedule, typical habits in most churches. The unspoken dynamic in such scenarios is that only two adults in the entire organization have the competency, credibility, and trustworthiness to make selfmanaged decisions. Let that sink in.

Perks and privileges for a select few at the top should always be a tell-tale sign that servant leadership is not functioning. Servants never get perks and privileges that those they are serving don’t get.

Paternalism is a classic trait of modern leadership. It treats adults as children and is demeaning, demoralizing, and unnecessary in a healthy spirit led organization.

Spiritual over Industrial

Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom

The “light and easy” proposition offered to our souls—our minds, will, and emotions—is out of reach when we have grown accustomed to operating from the power of human will and unrefined soulish strength, rather than the fuel of God’s Spirit. For leaders who have never heard of such operating structures this Starfish talk may sound not only impossible but also outrageous. The brilliance is in the processes and systems by which such organizations function. At the heart of this genius is a strident belief and trust in the capacity within people and the value placed on human relationships that consequently incorporate certain ground rules that support healthy and prolific teamwork. Morning Star’s Doug Kirkpatrick writes, “To the degree that our people are free to perform to the best of their ability, they are also free to innovate change that improves performance even more. There will be no barriers to communication in the workplace—anyone will be able to discuss anything with anyone else regardless of area or process.”36

Trust is as important as anything for those who hope to perpetuate movemental endeavors. Leaders who trust their teams show the greatest trust in God, because God is in the people that make up those teams. Developing cultures of freedom is the proof of trust and belief in the Spirit of God to do his work through his people. Any team member should be able to talk to anyone about anything relating to the organization and its endeavors. It should be easy for us to see that freedom in our job places is the most

natural and efficient way for us to operate. It is the way people actually live their lives at home and every place else.

The use of force and person-to-person unilateral authority is the most commonly used modus operandi of industrial aged leadership. Exercising rank, intimidation, or leveraging sheer personality power comes not from the Spirit of God but from the lower primal parts of creature behavioral dominance.

Remember, management was originally developed in order to depersonalize work so that employees could be easily stationed, evaluated and replaced when deemed obsolete. It was and is a form of dehumanization.

Anyone who has been unceremoniously fired or harshly talked down to can attest to feeling depersonalized. This is why the Industrial Revolution instituted hierarchy in the first place, where leaders were given heavy-handed power over others. Relationships and human feeling and emotions were considered as needless distractions. Who ever heard an ironworker asking a furnace how life was going or a mechanic asking an engine if it had any thoughts on how to produce more horsepower?

People began to be treated as if they were cogs, parts, and machines. They were expected to do their appointed job, nothing more, nothing less. Leave it to the architects and engineers to figure out improvements and better ways.

There is a far better way. And certainly, there is a Godlier way, that is also very much life giving. In his book Alive at Work, Daniel Cable discusses the neuroscience behind what motivates or disengages people. He says, “Many organizations are deactivating the part of employees’ brains called the seeking system. Our seeking systems create the natural impulse to explore our worlds, learn about our environments, and extract meaning from our circumstances. When we follow the urges of our seeking system, it releases dopamine—a neurotransmitter linked to motivation and pleasure—that makes us want to explore more.”37

Most organizations today have cultures that simply do not foster experimentation and creativity that reaches beyond predetermined job descriptions and preset decision-making boundaries. It should be simple to see that this grossly limits people’s untapped skills and insight—a vast resource of problem solving and potential of creative advancement. Amazingly enough each and every day we all utilize technology that was created and continues to develop at astonishing rates—by companies such as Google or Apple, which have flexible work cultures that encourage freedom and creativity. Innovation of world changing levels most often arises in such cultures.

Coaching over Bossing

Moving from hierarchical to humble leadership changes the role of a leader from boss and manager to coach and mentor. The leader’s goal is to help her teammates discover and develop their fullest potential. By choosing to relinquish the Wizard role we cease wearing ourselves down in the feverish pace of command and control. Instead, we work to unleash the brainpower, heart passion, and courageous fortitude of our team members. This scenario requires attitudes of equality from everyone on the team. Apart from such postures honest and transparent communication will never thrive. People will only tell those above them what they think they want to hear and those below them what they think they need to know. It leaves no chance for genuine relationships and familial community to flourish.
Seven Coaching Questions That Will Change the Way You Lead Forever

Our leaders/coaches in the KC Underground use the following seven questions to develop our leaders. These are from The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More, & Change the Way You Lead Forever by Michael Bungay Stanier.

The Kick Start Question: What's on your mind?

The A.W.E. Question: And what else?

The Focus Question: What's the real challenge here for you?

The Foundation Question: What do you want?

The Lazy Question: How can I help?

The Strategic Question: If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?

The Learning Question: What was most useful for you?

Transforming our perspective of one another to that of yokefellows produces a peer-based culture rather than a traditional leadership culture. We no longer categorize people as leaders and subordinates. There is no elevating or superstaring of leadership because there is no thought of or leveraging of rank.

Leadership emerges as a natural byproduct that materializes organically and exceptionally. Wheatley fittingly says, “In nature, change never happens as a result of top-down, preconceived strategic plans or from the mandate of any single individual or boss. Change

begins as local actions spring up simultaneously around the system.”

When we allow our organizations to be ruled on the Spirit’s shoulders governance happens regularly, distributed throughout

the organization. No longer does it rest upon one single leader but becomes a key process. It changes the way we function in leadership by changing the way we view our roles. Distributed leadership means that “functions that traditionally reside with a CEO or executive team (move) into processes that are enacted throughout the organization, with everyone’s participation.”39

Clear processes are essential for the type of leadership system we are speaking of to work. Moving forward in the book we will deal with principles and practices that answer questions such as:

Who can make decisions and what are the limits on those decisions?

How is accountability held in place?

What actions can individuals make without keeping the organization bogged down in meetings?

What agreements should we come to in order to honor the spirit of being yokefellows?

Transitioning toward Starfish and Spirit leadership brings us to a place of trusting the Spirit of God to build his people and lead his organizations via the people that are the organization. The gifts and fruit of the Spirit are unleashed to flow freely throughout the group, unfettered and unlimited by a small elevated few.

Chapter 5
Thinking Outside the Pyramid

The modern organization cannot be an organization

of boss and subordinate.

–Peter Drucker

Movements, by definition, cannot be led, and they

cannot be planned really. They defy control and singular identity. A movement is a leaderless enterprise.

–Brian Sanders
Have you ever tried to roll a triangle? Cavemen figured out a long time ago that circles make much better wheels than pyramids do. This simile is a clue for movement thinking. If we hope for our organizations to proliferate as dynamic movements then we must seek to discover movemental types of leadership systems. The first challenge for most of us will be to think beyond the triangles of the most commonly used organization charts.

Whether you are a senior leader or staff member with leadership oversight in particular areas of your organization, when seeking to uncork the latent talent available, you must be willing to consider an entirely different function from a traditional CEO, senior, or junior executive. To reimagine leadership in the structure of the starfish kind we certainly face challenges, but we can also crack the safe of greater inspiration as we consider the transformational possibilities.

The challenges are in abandoning the old ways of thinking while resisting our own knee jerk reactions back to what we have always known. Peter Block says, “The concept of leadership does not leave much room for the concept of partnership. We need a way to hold on to the initiative and accountability and vision of the leadership idea, and to abandon the inevitable baggage of dominance and selfcenteredness.”40

Circle-Celled

Every living thing is made up of cells and the starfish is of course no exception. Think of the cells of a starfish as circles. Within the starfish leadership structure the circle is, in the words of Baldwin and Linnea, “...essentially a gathering of equals, people who set aside external, hierarchical positions that categorize and separate them and sit down in a ring of chairs with a clearly defined intention or purpose symbolically represented in the middle.”41

The Godhead is a circle! The old-world image of God is that of a singular monarch, seated on a throne: a pyramid. The Latin word for God is Deus, not a far cry from Zeus, a primitive image of God that still occupies the imaginations of millions. Your image of God influences your entire life. You become like the God you worship. That’s why we have so much Zeus-like leadership.

Yet, how radically did Jesus deconstruct this pyramid? God comes as a vulnerable baby born among an oppressed people in a land occupied by Zeus-worshippers. He lived as simple man of trade, then kicked started his ministry by creating a leadership circle of fisherman and tax-collectors. Gradually, he reveals the Circle at the Center: Father, Son, and Spirit. Of course, it took the church centuries to develop the doctrine of the Trinity until finally the Cappadocian Fathers used a word from Greek theater to describe it, paerichoresis, which literally means circle dance. God is a relationship or dance of equality and interdependence. We are invited into that the circle. How could we not model all of our leadership on this theological foundation? 42

We need circles of equality and interdependence that are open, inviting others in. That is the way of Jesus.

The circle changes the leader’s role to that of a facilitator and coach who generates some, but by no means all, of the ideas while allowing those in his or her circle to not only follow through on concepts, but to add to and adapt them. The result is not a leaderless church or organization. Far from it, the upshot is more and better leadership.

For a Starfish culture to thrive leaders must reimagine their roles and practices. Several years ago, I (Lance) was part of a pastoral team that experimented with a form of shared leadership. Up to this point the church was led in the typical Senior Pastor/Associate Pastors structure. I (Lance) was one of the two associate pastors. The Senior Pastor was a true shepherd and teacher. He was altogether selfless and sharing. The three of us had diverse gift mixes and therefore complimented one another tremendously, filling the other’s shortcomings in both viewpoint and talent.

Our pulpit voices brought a healthy variety of insight and perspective to the discipling of the members and the church exploded in growth. It was brimming in creativity, development, and an overall lifechanging message. But it all came to a sudden end when the Lead guy finally could not take not receiving primary credit for the wonderful things that were happening in our midst. He felt a sense of diminishing value and initiated a devastating blow up that split the church. Over two decades later he has repeatedly confessed his lack of maturity at the time along with a deep regret for causing the end to what was a great work of the Spirit up to that point. Thankfully we have had a healthy restored relationship for many years now.

Though this pastor had his share of blame in the botched leadership experiment it was not altogether his fault. Looking back on the situation, we had failed to develop ground rules and necessary structures and systems vital to operating a shared leadership ethos. This omission served to create opportunities for poor communication and a lack of healthy sharing of information.

Previously each of us had experience only in pyramid leadership structure, which runs on a diminished degree of relational IQ. It lacks the holistic components that make a living body function. There was no systemic mutual understanding or practical habits to support our desire for shared leadership. Each of us had teams and programs we led. But without ground rules and processes in place we were, in essence, each doing our own thing. The cumulative effect bred inadvertent competition, insecurity, and a feeling of disorientation. We plainly lacked the necessary systems of navigation for the uncharted waters before us. Even a few simple practices would have helped tremendously. Understanding the power of circles would have been the perfect starting place.

Taking nothing for granted, Peter Block is a stickler for circling up. He even believes the way we arrange meeting spaces weigh heavily on the way groups relate to one another and one of the most helpful ways to convene collegiality and do away with prestige and control is to rearrange the room. Block’s motto is “Change the room, change the culture.”—

The task is to rearrange the room to meet our intention to build relatedness, accountability, and commitment. The room needs to express the quality of aliveness and belonging that we wish for the community. The circle is the geometric symbol for community, and therefore for arranging the room. No tables if possible. If tables are a given, then choose round ones (the shape of communion), which are better than rectangles (the shape of negotiation), or classroom-style tables (the shape of instruction). The ideal seating for a small group is a circle of chairs with no table. Put the chairs as close together as possible, which forces people to lean into one another.43

The wisdom here is that it fleshes out and actualizes the symbols we say characterize us. For instance, Janette has served as Senior Rabbi for over seven years of a sizeable congregation on the East Coast. Throughout the past year or so she has worked with her staff to shift into a peer led, circle leadership culture. Janette has worked diligently to shape the culture of the team by not only encouraging others to share their thoughts, ideas, and creativity on a daily basis, but she is careful to use inclusive language throughout her interactions. In planning meetings Janette and the team arrange the room in a circle and she views a shift of her role from being decider and enabler to discerner and equipper.
Assessing the Circle

Catalytic leaders understand the gifts, passions and stories of their circle-members. This awareness increases the possibility of a meaningful interdependent dance, where we move together, leveraging each person’s strengths and buttressing each other’s weaknesses. Without assessment, the dance diminishes, as we step on each other’s toes. Consider the following assessment tools. These are the assessment tools we use in the KC Underground.

GPS: Gifts, Passions, Story. (giftspassionstory.com)

DISC Profile (discprofile.com)

Strengthfinders (gallup.com/cliftonstrengths)

Five Voices (5voices.com)

Enneagram (enneagraminstitute.com)

APEST (fivefoldsurvey.com)

Janette seeks to draw out of each team member the voice the Spirit has given him or her to speak to the overall leadership community, without limits. She has utilized multiple types of gifts assessments as she sought to bring team wide understanding of one another across the organization. Janette senses a key part of her role for the organization is to help every team member have the opportunity to present his or her best insight, talent, and desires to the overall mission. Her thoughts constantly lean toward ways to crack open the latent insights the Spirit has imparted into each person. Frequently, prior to a meeting, Janette asks another team member to serve as catalyst for the gathering. She is content to meld into the circle with no greater status than any other participant. This rabbi cedes the leadership to the Spirit’s movement through all within the circle. It has become

increasingly common during strategic meetings for a key idea or perspective to come forth through a team member that a couple of years prior would have not felt free or encouraged to share his viewpoint based on his role, rank, or fear of status loss.

Think of yourselves the way Christ Jesus thought of himself. He had equal status with God but didn’t think so much of himself that he had to cling to the advantages of that status no matter what. Not at all. When the time came, he set aside the privileges of deity and took on the status of a slave, became human! Having become human, he stayed human. It was an incredibly humbling process. He didn't claim special privileges. Instead, he lived a selfless, obedient life and then died a selfless, obedient death--and the worst kind of death at that--a crucifixion.

Phil. 2:5-7 The Message

Catalyst-Sparked

Shifting to shared leadership compels leaders who have been accustomed to being in charge to let go of insecurities that nurture their self-worth based upon the importance they have to the group or organization. Their identity must go deeper than what they mean to the group as a leader. For faith leaders we must incarnate the motto of John the Baptist: “He must become greater; I must become less”44 in order to trust God to rule supreme and move through who He chooses in the moment.

The ego trap of leader-identity breeds demands for respect and flawed definitions of success. It is an ever-present pitfall that must be backfilled with a soul settling resolve that finds contentment and value simply as a treasured child of God, apart from status and titles. Leaders in this mode find joy in seeing the gifts and talents of others bloom and flourish. This paradigm sets our teams free to work from our true calling as servants for all of God’s children. Fredrick Laloux in his brilliant book Reinventing Organizations shares:

The pursuit of love, recognition, and success shapes our lives slowly but surely to the point that we end up, in the words of poet May Sarton, “Wearing other people’s faces.” Our journey toward inner rightness prompts some soul searching of who we are and what our purpose in life might be. The ultimate goal in life is not to be successful or loved, but to become the truest expression of ourselves, to live into authentic selfhood, to honor our birthright gifts and callings, and be of service to humanity and our world.45

The Starfish goal is not to give everyone the exact same volume of power. The quest is to make everyone as powerful as possible. This means we let go of the over wrought identity of leader and embrace the roll of a catalyst. The catalyst shapes culture and DNA but is happy to cede control in the moment to the members of the team. In letting go of the headship role, the catalyst transfers deep, shared ownership and responsibility to the circle under the leadership of the Spirit of God. The results are freedom for creativity, greater buy-in, lasting stability, mutual respect, and deeper community meaning.

Developing a culture of mutuality requires practical steps of addressing status language that undermines the ethos of collegiality. Jesus gave unambiguous instructions about his feelings and commands regarding leadership in his tribe in regard to titles. Yet what he demands in the following is patently ignored in almost every church and religious entity.

But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.

Matthew 23:6-12

Jesus says we are siblings. Churches are not businesses or corporations. They are family. His point? Stop elevating yourselves over one another. If you want to go up do so by going down. Humble yourself and let God do the exalting. He flattened the hierarchical ideals. Jesus didn’t say if you want to become great become a leader. He said, “If you want to be great, become a servant.” He was emphatic. He forbade rank-based titles, permitting no place for them. Why so, we may wonder.

First off, titles are meant to identify but too often they are dividers. They highlight status, for better or worse. Titles too often position one person or group over the other and create boundaries, fences, and doors that need permission or privilege for entry. Titles change the entire dynamic of a relationship, creating a new set of rules and limits of expression, openness, and authenticity. As soon as a title is applied to one person, the title “less than or greater than” is pinned to the other. Titles create psychological and sociological dynamics of hierarchy.46 Holding on to rank-based titles undermine collegiality.

Leadership and Power

Making the titular shift from senior leader to co-worker is not a negative change in status, unless the leader feels the need to leverage her title or seniority. The Starfish effect is not a demotion of any one leader. It is a promotion for everyone! It unleashes the servantship spirit throughout the organization.

This is a shift in the perception of the way we view leadership power. It changes our view of how it best works and how the Spirit of God works it in us and throughout our groups and organizations. A commitment on this point means leaders become better people. They become humble, spirit-led humans as opposed to dominating personalities. It provides no quarter for bullies or tyrants.

Developing synagogues, churches, or any type organization in the Starfish mode takes patience on everyone’s part. You may have heard the famous Druckerism—“culture eats strategy for breakfast.” A Starfish strategy is not enough. Success or failure depends on the hard work of creating a new culture. The challenge is to develop modes of leadership that maintain accountability and vision while dispatching with dominance and ego-driven self-centered command and control.

For organizations seeking to shift to Starfish leadership the temptation is to throw in the towel when emotions run raw, concluding the industrial way was easier. We are the first to admit that hierarchical leadership is indeed easier in the beginning. But easier is seldom better.

Early on in the quest to reinvent his fledgling construction company, Sid—an experienced owner of past businesses worth millions—took up my (Lance) challenge to build something different, to start doing business as unusual. The first time I discussed the concepts we are looking at in this book with him Sid responded as if I had told him I believed in the Tooth Fairy. Unbeknownst to me he read one of the books I suggested and a few weeks later came to me and said, “Okay, I believe this is right. Now, how do we do it?”

Over the next several months Sid began to develop a company that has become profitable as well as filled with highly content coworkers, many of whom are utilizing elements of wisdom and creativity that they were never permitted to exercise in previous work environments. Looking back at the experiment and its current yield Sid says the biggest fear he had in a Starfish leadership shift was, “Trusting others when the stuff hit the fan. In my past company I would just micro-manage and I knew everything would float. But as soon as I took that pressure off people it all caved in. The early days of implementing a flattened leadership structure were met with some real bumps in the road and I was really tempted to throw in the towel and just revert back to command and control. I’m so glad I didn’t.” Sid’s biggest surprise of the experiment has been “discovering the indomitable spirit within people when they are trusted and permitted to bring their entire selves to the workplace. I now have an entire team of creative people that show up every day believing we are going to do something great together.”

In The Starfish and The Spider Ori Brafman stressed the differences in CEO type leadership—

A CEO is The Boss. He’s in charge, and he occupies the top of the hierarchy. A catalyst interacts with people as a peer. He comes across as your friend. Because CEOs must be rational; their job is to create shareholder value. Catalysts depend on emotional intelligence; their job is to create personal relationships.47

To attain this, it is crucial that the organizational culture abound in both spirit and practice of shared leading. In letting go of the leadership role, the catalyst transfers ownership and responsibility to the circle.48 At the same time while attempting to develop Starfish cultures it is extremely important that we not abandon agreed upon rules and well thought systems. Jettisoning policies and guidelines altogether

are both unwise and impractical. It sets the stage for abuse and emotional driven collapses. Servantship and a Starfish culture will not simply evolve in a vacuum of hierarchy.

Starfish thinking “does not mean that we are all interchangeable, or that we are all the same—with equal talents, experience, needs, ambitions, and so forth—or that we even make equal contributions. But what it does assert is that all members of the organization have equal standing.”49 This paradigm is rooted in the belief that the answers to our problems or opportunities is not relegated to top tier leadership but can be found at any place within the circle. The answers emerge because of the culture that both supports and encourages mutual respect and ideation throughout the organization.

Ori wrote about the role of leader as catalyst: “In chemistry, a catalyst is any element or compound that initiates a reaction without fusing into that reaction. In open organizations, a catalyst is the person who initiates a circle and then fades away into the background.”50

The catalyst trusts that those in her circle have the knowledge, skill, and ability to bring the best answers to existing problems and opportunities.

Collaboratively Co-Laboring

Let’s do a bit of word study. First, consider the word collaboration. This word means to work with others on a shared goal. There is much to discover when we ruminate on the power in this term. The first thing we should notice is the root is co-labor. Notice that no hierarchy is present. The prefix co means mutual and in common, therefore equality is assumed and by definition, is emphasized. This word is used 13 times in the Christian New Testament, translated in multiple forms: fellow laborer, helper, fellow worker, fellow helper, workfellow, companion, etc. The Greek transliteration is synergos. This is where we get the English word synergy. Co-laboring produces synergy! Synergy is the experience or effect that takes place when the combined interactions of people create more wisdom, ideation, and fruit than the sum of the individuals in solo mode.

As Ori has said previously, “In letting go of the leadership role, the catalyst transfers ownership and responsibility to the circle.”51 This makes way for the catalyzing of synergy. Co-laboring is about being a peer-based organization. The etymology of the word peer is fascinating. To peer means to squint at, to look intently in order to bring into focus. The word also means to consider as an equal. Bosses are not peers because they do not allow others to really see them, to really know them. This mindset goes hand in hand with not considering certain members of the team to be their equals.

Time and again both Rob and I have heard Senior Pastors advise young pastors to keep a distance between themselves and their staff. The ideology is that if you become friends with your staff you will lose authority over them. The myth surrounding such leaders is that they do not possess real authority in the first place. They brandish power via fear and intimidation. Such advise clearly thumbs its nose at Jesus and his model of relationship with his twelve disciples

No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. —Jesus52
The principle of circle over pyramid yields limitless metaphors. One that we have found useful is that of a fire pit with the group circled around it. A good fire is necessary for warmth, illumination, and food. Collaboration means every member of the team is around the fire in view of one another. The fire represents the organization (church, company, guild, etc.) including

its vision, values, initiatives, history, and present opportunities and risks. The flames will only keep going if fuel is continually added as needed. Each member seated around it brings in the wood for the fire. The wood is each member’s story, experience, skills, ideas, wisdom, and opinion. Anyone is free to place wood on the fire— kindling, chunks, and chips, whatever they have. When routine updates and decisions are needed “let’s gather around the fire” is a great metaphor for any team.
We are not advocating for the total dispelling of hierarchy. What

we are encouraging is a naturally organizing, fresh hierarchy that is not a cold steel framed ladder. It is a living system that replaces systems that subordinate the majority of the organization to a select few with “a hierarchy of processes, projects, and assignments.”53

In the absence of hierarchy of “bosses over subordinates, space becomes available for other natural and spontaneous hierarchies to spring up.”54 The new hierarchy constantly renews itself and manifests spontaneously and without fanfare, built on “recognition, influence, and skill (sometimes referred to as ‘actualization hierarchies’ in place of traditional ‘dominator hierarchies’).”55

Wheatley writes,

Entering into a world of shared significance is only achieved by engaging in conversations with colleagues. Not debates or oratories, but conversation that welcomes in the unique perspective of everyone there. If we remain curious about what someone else sees and refrain from convincing them of our interpretation, we develop a richer view of what might be going on. And we also create collegial relations that enable us to work together with greater speed and effectiveness. When any of us feel invited to share our perspective, we repay that respect and trust with commitment and friendship.56

Collaboration through Organic Hierarchy does not lessen responsibility and accountability. To the contrary, it expands both by placing them on everyone within the organization. No longer is a worker responsible and accountable to one higher up supervisor or manager. He is now responsible and accountable to his fellow workers.

In the fall of 2018 our (Lance) farming neighborhood near Panama City, Florida was among those hit head on with Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 storm that was the third most intense hurricane to ever strike the United States. The devastation was incomprehensible. Every major highway and country road in the county became little more than forest trails as over 2.5 million pine and other trees came crashing down. The most needed commodities in the days following the storm were water, chain saws,

generators, and fuel. These supplies could only be found well outside the counties hit by the storm. Two days after the storm I was awakened by a voice whispering through my bedroom screen window. “Hey Lance. We’re driving to Dothan, AL for supplies. You wanna’ go?” Markus, my neighbor had procured an enclosed twenty-foot cargo trailer and was rounding up neighbors to make the trip. That evening we returned with pallets of water, dozens of filled gas containers, generators, and chainsaws. The neighbors self-organized, acquired supplies, and cleared our road.

If competent people can self-manage and organize their day-to-day life the question presents itself as to why these same people would lose that high level of expertise and ability when they show up for work.

Speaking on organizational intelligence, biologist Francisco Varela says “

It isn’t the ability to solve problems that makes an organization smart. It is the ability of its members to enter into a world whose significance they share. Everyone in the group has to feel that what is occurring is significant—even as they have different perspectives.57

Coaching & Mentoring Guided

Without counsel plans fail,

but with many advisers they succeed.

Proverbs 15:22

Jesus was the greatest leader ever and he modeled servanthood at its best. We should be asking why our best books on leadership are not filled with the way he formed his team and led them! It is the fuel of humility that drives leaders who identify themselves not as bosses but servants. They have found great joy and strength in helping those around them discover and experiment with their own potential. It makes for the best type of leader because it causes people to want to be around such catalysts.

Mentoring is as old as civilization itself. Through this natural relational process, experience and values pass from one generation to another. Mentoring took place among Old Testament prophets (Eli and Samuel, Elijah and Elisha) and leaders (Moses and Joshua), and New Testament leaders (Barnabas and Paul, Paul and Timothy). Throughout human history, mentoring was the primary means of passing on knowledge and skills in every field—from Greek philosophers to sailors—and in every culture. But in the modern age, the learning shifted. It now relies primarily on computers, classrooms, books and videos. Thus, today the relational connection between the knowledge-and-experience giver and the receiver has weakened or is nonexistent.58

Elder Coaching and Mentoring

Dispatching traditional management and rank based titles as we develop a peer-based organization requires managers reinvent their roles into those of coaches and mentors. This aspect is vital for implementing self-management. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim cultures all recognize the value of receiving the wise council of elders. In peer-based circle leadership organizations rank-based executive leadership gives way to relational-based elder leadership. The pressure of rank disappears as the advisory function emerges releasing wisdom, knowledge, and experienced based understanding.

The primary reason why our ideas on church leadership have strayed so far from Jesus’ example, can be traced to our tendency to project Western notions of government and business onto our faith communities. When we read words like “pastor,” “overseer,” and “elder,” we immediately think in terms of governmental offices like “president” or business offices like “CEO.” At that point, we regard elders, pastors, and overseers as sociological constructs (offices). We view them as vacant slots that possess a reality independent of the persons who populate them, which they don’t.

On this Frank Voila notes, “Such biases have transformed simple words into heavily loaded ecclesiastical titles. As a result, they have eroded the original landscape of the church. Thus, a fresh reading of the

N.T. in its original language is necessary for properly understanding certain texts. For instance, a look at the original

Greek yields the following insights:

“Overseers/Bishops” are simply guardians (episkopoi), not High-Church officials.

“Pastors” are caretakers (poimen), not professional preachers.

“Deacons” are servants (diakonos), not clergy.

“Elders” are wise individuals (presbuteros), not bosses on the board.” 59

Three different terms are used in the New Testament to refer to the same church leaders:

“POIMEN” translated as “shepherds” or “pastors.”

“PRESBUTEROS” translated as “elders.”

“EPISCOPOS” translated as “overseers” or rarely, “bishops”

Elders are…

Guardians (episkopoi) protecting and defending the flock, not High-Church officers who leverage their position for their personal advancement. (1 Peter 5:1-4, James 5:13-15)

Caretakers (poimen) who serve with the spirit of one who is “among” the flock, not “over” the flock (Acts 20:35).

Wise Guides (presbuteros) who know God’s word and how to apply it with discernment, orthodoxy and specificity, not professional preachers. (1 Timothy 5:17; 3:2, Titus 1:9; Acts

20:27, 32, Hebrews 13:7, 17, 24)

Influencers in that by virtue of their wisdom and spiritual maturity, they are accorded respect. Their godly character, spiritual stature, and sacrificial service to the people of God gives them increased influence. They have an ability to help those who are immature, off track or confused to reorient their lives under Jesus’ Lordship and the authority of the Scripture because of their persuasive power to convince and to win over rather than to coerce, force, or browbeat others into submission.

Appointed People who are not “elected,” but recognized. The term in the New Testament is that of the “laying on of hands,” by an established elder-level leader (Acts 14:23; 1 Timothy5:22; Titus 1:5). This was a recognition of the “elder-life” they had already been living. The Spirit was active, helping current elders recognize the emerging elders and overseers (Acts 20:28). But this divine guidance does not short circuit a very frank assessment of a person’s character ( 1 Timothy 3:2-7 and Titus 1:5-9). Elders are to have healthy families, emotional and spiritual maturity, an ability to communicate and teach truth, and a sound reputation, not just with insiders within the faith community, but among others outside the faith community, who don’t

believe what they do. Now, the community recognizes together that they have become older siblings, whose leadership is worthy to be honored and respected.

Reviewing the Circle

Here’s our way of doing peer-based review in the KC Underground. Each member of our circle, those who lead equipping teams and function as elders, are officially reviewed by a peer, a person to their “right and left,” every four months. Those who are to your “right and left,” shift as you cycle through the entire circle over time. Once a year, you receive the feedback of the entire circle in an annual review. Of course, between the official reviews is a continuous cycle of peer-based feedback facilitated by weekly meetings and life together.

We look at areas like:

Celebration: What are this person’s unique contributions? What is their sweet spot?

Constipation: Where are they stuck? What is this person blind spots?

Disposition: What level of Emotional, Relational and Spiritual Maturity are they displaying?

Execution: How productive are they? How well do they keep their promises? How well are they living into their sweet spot?

The goal of eldership is that of facilitation, guidance, equipping, mentoring, nurture, and ultimately, service.

Peer Coaching and Mentoring

For teams, the most important remembrance is: You are in a peer relationship with those around you. This means each member commits to be both willing to give and receive feedback, critique, encouragement, and opinion in the spirit of generous discourse among the other team members. The commitment is to actively view one another as a peer mentor and for each person to broaden their view of their own responsibilities. Everyone vows to keep eyes, ears, and minds open to issues, opportunities, threats, and solutions.

When people work together with freedom as an overarching premise, they are motivated not by a single charismatic leader but by the shared vision and goals that come from the mission itself. In a setting such as this

team members are peers, working together as such and holding one another accountable for the overall performance and results of the group as a whole.

Hierarchy of Positions

Hierarchy of Processes
To be a lone chief atop a pyramid is abnormal and corrupting. None of us are perfect by ourselves, and all of us need the help and correcting influence of close colleagues. When someone is moved atop a pyramid, that person no longer has colleagues, only subordinates. Even the frankest and bravest of subordinates do not talk with their boss in the same way that they talk with their colleagues who are equals, and normal communication patterns become warped.

-Robert Greenleaf60

Moving past pyramid style organizational structures and circling up in our leadership systems does not create a dull or weak uniformity. Peer led groups, churches, and organizations are not seeking to equalize individual power and talent. They are working to equalize opportunities across the field of their organization. Realizing that wisdom, knowledge, and understanding is exponentially available in the whole group rather than the select few, the circle-celled group leverages its best ideas and abilities in the moment of need or opportunity.

Chapter 6

The Self-Management Starfish

Freedom & Order

You don’t manage your peers, You collaborate with them.

–Jeffrey Nielsen

For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.
afternoon the Senior Pastor knocked on my (Lance) office door and stopped in for a brief chat. He was in a cheerful mood with nothing in particular on his mind. “Just wanted to drop by and see how you’re doing,” he said with a smile. We chatted for a few minutes before he went on his way. After he left, I went back to what I was doing before he came in. But I became aware of something about my demeanor while in his presence. “What is this strange feeling that’s come over me?” I wondered. It took a couple of minutes of pondering and then I had it. I felt like a little boy while I was in the presence of the SP. It was a strange phenomenon but that was precisely it. Here I was, a 41-year-old man who had managed to get married, own a home, raise three children, plant and pastor several churches, grill steaks without burning the house down, and drive myself to work. Yet, I felt like an adolescent in the moment.

Something was being projected in the relationship between the SP and myself. We were not on equal footing. I was constantly looking up at him and he was looking down on me. Relational dynamics change when we operate from rank-based systems. Colleagues are lost at the expense of subordinates.

The confusing thing is that the pastor I am speaking of is a wonderful man. I love him dearly and am beyond thankful for so much that he has taught me. He is not a jerk. It would be much easier for people trapped in spider leadership cultures to pinpoint it if all senior leaders were complete jerks. We could just say, “The guy is a jerk and he leads like a jerk.”

The hitch is that a lot of Godly folks lead in ungodly ways. So, it took a while to put my finger on what I was feeling. But after a few months of working at this church I was finally able to get my head around it. The leadership environment in place was not only mechanistic it was paternalistic. For anyone other

than the select Executive leadership team, self-management was out of bounds. Staff members outside that exclusive group knew in their hearts they were more than capable of doing their jobs. But being subjected to a command and control culture projected a parent-child atmosphere upon them and it had produced a devastating effect among the most tenured of staff. It had eroded their confidence, and it showed. They had been reduced and their souls were suffering.

I had wondered why there was a somewhat broken spirit in several of those who had served the church for some years. These were very sharp, extremely godly men and women, full of talent and superb gift mixes and experience. One evening I told my wife, “There is something I can see in their eyes. It is a longing. It is like an unfulfilled desire that even diminishes their smiles. They are like a corral full of powerful horses, that once were free to run and jump with boundless joy and energy but have become broken stable ponies—relegated to lopping walks and controlled trots—in service of the dude ranch trail boss for the paying customers.”

There were a handful of us that joined the staff around the same time and there was a discernable difference in our energy and spirit—early on. We were all very upbeat. But we were changing too. Being under the management thumb was throttling the blood flow. Like an improperly placed tourniquet the lifeblood was being choked down. We were slowly becoming numb too. As I began to experience the over-managed culture it became clear this atmosphere would break one’s spirit. Margaret Wheatley speaks to why this is the case

We have people in the organization ready and willing to do good work, wanting to contribute their ideas, ready to take responsibility, and leaders holding them back, insisting that they wait for decisions or instructions. The result is dispirited employees and leaders wondering why no one takes responsibility or gets engaged anymore. We have known for more than half a century that self-managed teams are far more productive than any other form of organizing. There is a clear correlation between participation and productivity; in fact, productivity gains in truly selfmanaged work environments are at minimum 35 percent higher than in traditionally managed organizations.61
Everything we are pointing to in this chapter gives obedience and process to Jesus’ leadership philosophy. He puts it out as a direct commandment to the small group of disciples he is pouring himself into as the future shapers of his church:

Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you.”

–Matthew 20:25-26a

But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many

—Matthew 20:26b-28

Getting honest with the Lord and ourselves demands we ask hard questions of ourselves and give honest answers as to if we lord over anyone on our staff or in the organization:

Do I dictate how they use their time?

Do I interrupt their space or speech in ways they are fearful of doing in like kind to me?

Can questions, critique, and challenges be shared without fear of demotion, firing, or sharp rebuke?

Does everyone have free access to everyone?

Do I pull rank or project intimidation at times?

The answers to these few questions are hints as to whether or not we are embracing and obeying Jesus’ ethos of leadership, which is based on serving, and is in direct conflict to much of modernity’s ways and means of leadership, which is being served by others.

In recent years the universally accepted rank-based title of Senior Pastor has become so ingrained in evangelical churches that it has yielded a spin-off some call the second chair. Usually titled Executive Pastor, this position joins the senior pastor to form a dynamic duo atop the local church leadership hierarchy. In the opening words of their book Leading from the Second Chair, Bonem and Patterson set the stage for the top-down ideology that is so prevalent across the evangelical church landscape today:

We have been frequent consumers of books, tapes, and conferences as a means of improving our leadership. Yet we have often felt frustration or discouragement after using these resources because they were not aimed at us. Their focus was the senior leader of the organization, the person who has the freedom and relative autonomy that comes with this top position. In the second chair, the amount of change you can initiate is limited because you are not the vision caster, the lead leader. You do not have to be the number two person in an organizational hierarchy to be a second chair leader. In fact, our definition can include anyone who is not the lead leader. Every organization has a perceived pecking order.62

(San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2005), 1, 3.
Lead Pastor?

The Bible never refers to a human being as a “head” or “lead/senior pastor” of a church. This title exclusively belongs to Jesus Christ. He is the only Head of the church.

Quite simply there is no analog for the modern idea of “lead pastor” anywhere in the New Testament. Some might say, “The first three chapters in Revelation speak of an angel for each church. Isn’t that symbolic of a lead pastor?”

Scholars are unsure of what the angel symbolizes and beyond the obvious interpretation of it being an actual angel, any other applications are cryptic at best.

In the New Testament, every clear instance we see is that of a circle of elders (Acts 20:17; Acts 20:28), leadership was always plural.

There is no nuance of top-down language here. Phrases such as “senior leader,” “top position,” “lead leader,” “organizational hierarchy,” and “pecking order” make it staunchly clear that one person is on top and that everyone else descends from there.63 And there is no embarrassment or shame in the terms used. This is patent disregard for the ethos Jesus said he wanted for his church and his followers to lead enterprises in.

If you are a senior leader, think back to a time when you were not in a top tier position. How did you feel being bossed and controlled? How did it affect your creativity and spirit? Very few people want to be controlled.

In their book, Accountability: Freedom and Responsibility without Control, Lebow and Spitzer say “As individuals become more self-confident in their ability to be great, they simply can no longer live in a management-employee context that continues to attempt to subtly manipulate or control them in a paternalistic way. And so, they eventually leave the organization looking for more freedom.” By its very nature control perpetuates a search for escape by the one being controlled. Eventually the best talent in control-minded groups departs in search of freedom of expression. Not surprisingly, within the next year or so

there was an almost entire staff turnover in the church I have just written about.
The Lord Almighty created our world in such a way that it organizes and manages itself. The majority of the ecological problems our earth experiences come from the actions of mankind. The infamous dustbowl that ravaged the American and Canadian prairies of the 1930’s came about because of irresponsible farming methods that overtly damaged millions of acres of land. As rotation farming was learned the land repaired itself and another such disaster has yet to happen again.

Chaos and eventual collapse will surely arrive if we simply jettison traditional management systems. Moving beyond the pyramid requires us to reinvent practices and processes in our organization. A lot of questions need answers: Who makes decisions on what gets done? How are people held answerable for their actions and performance? What happens when team members are not in agreement?

The first step toward creating leadership cultures of adult-to-adult relationships is to install systems of self-management. Choosing freedom strips “all of our control-based assumptions and challenges our capacity to trust our people...that every staff member at every level is fully accountable for his or her ideas, actions, behaviors, and performance, without anyone looking over his or her shoulder.”64 This

means we determine to stop controlling people. When we do so we must commit to these foundational steps towards creating a self-management culture:

We trust our people

You will never see the best out of anyone when they must seek your approval. Policies and procedures that demonstrate a lack of confidence in our people not only stifle risk-taking creativity, they bog down progress.

Our people have the freedom to do their job as they see fit

Let individuals bring their style and creativity to bear upon their tasks. Just as there is no single correct batting stance for hitting a baseball (just take a look at videos of some of the all-time great baseball greats) or one way to swing a golf club or throw a football, there is no one correct way of getting every job done.

Teams and individuals set their own goals

Rather than having goals set for us, when we set our own goals, we naturally feel the responsibility for meeting them as well as monitoring the results along the way. When we dictate policies, people lose empowerment. Everyone shares their goals and holds one another accountable for progress and results.

The truth keeps us free

When information concerns someone (or a group) within the organization, don’t hide it behind closed doors. Unlock it. People deserve to be kept informed. Jesus taught us that truth sets us free only when we know it. Never pull rank or project intimidation to anyone at any skillset level as regards his or her right to speak up on an issue. Information and resources will not be held in control my any one person or sub-group of any size.

Leadership is an issue of power. In any given group it’s essence and outcomes come down to how power is viewed, exerted, released, and respected. When we choose partnership over paternalism, we carry out the “intention to balance power between ourselves and those around us.”65 We choose to release control to the nearest places the work is done. This doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Well thought out policies and practices are crucial. Among the most rewarding fruits of self-management comes from the impact it has upon the responsibility and ownership throughout the entire organizational culture. It yields quicker response and higher degrees of accurate answers to needs as they present themselves.

Let’s look at some keyways our associations can reorganize via self-management.
Willie Mays is considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time. Yet he failed to get a hit in his first three major league games. Downcast and distraught with an expectation that he was about to be yanked from the lineup, everything changed when his Manager, Leo Durocher said, “Listen to me, Willie. You are my centerfielder. Nothing is going to change that. Go out and play. Go out there and have some fun.” Mays started hitting that day and continued to do so for 21 seasons, ending up in the Hall of Fame. Such is the role of a good coach or consultant. We all learn through struggles. Leo Durocher knew Willie Mays was naturally talented. Though he oversaw the team he knew he could never hit like Willie could. He didn’t need to tell his player how to hit a baseball. The problem was that Mays was pressing. The pressure to perform was locking up his natural greatness.

Great coaches focus on stirring up inherent strengths and existing capabilities in their players by projecting confidence and trust. The undergirding effect of trust is that it breeds confidence in the one that knows he is being trusted. It results in a relaxed approach that causes talent to do its thing naturally and unforced.

A commitment to trust produces a culture whereby people across the board feel respected and taken seriously. Leadership guru Max De Pree suggests, “Respect demands that we first recognize each other’s gifts and strengths and interests; then we must integrate them into the work of the organization.”66 This speaks to a change in paradigm necessary among senior leaders as to how they view their roles. It is essential if we are serious about transitioning a rank-based organization into a role-based team of partners. To do so means we transition from controlling to consulting, from calculating to coaching.

A good consultant listens more than she tells. Consultants and coaches focus on the common goals, collect and disseminate necessary information, and work to deliver the needed information and resources into the hands of the ones who are closest to an issue. This role aims to enrich and endow those that already have the skill set to solve a particular problem or create new opportunities. Take Tom Brady, nine-time Super Bowl quarterback. He is arguably the greatest quarterback of all time. Yet, he has a quarterback coach. Two things come to the fore with that thought in mind. First off, just the fact that Tom Brady still has a quarterback coach. The great Tom Brady benefits from having a consultant helping him with the nuance of his craft. Secondly, you probably have never heard of Tom Brady’s quarterback coach. Why? Because that guy—whatever his name is—isn’t trying to be a star. He knows his job is to help Tom Brady be the best quarterback he can be.

This is the mindset we should crave. It brings to life the instructions in Ephesians chapter four by “equipping the saints for the work of service.”67 The job of a New Testament believing leader is to help the ones around her be the best they can be in service of the Kingdom of Heaven. It means we are convinced the skill and knowledge for whatever needs to be done is inherent in the team. Advising on peer-based organizations, Jeffrey Nielson writes, “When you trust your people and seek to consult them, not control them, and when you trust the intellectual capital already in the organization...you are cooperating with the self-organizing dynamic in organizations.”

We cannot expect people to take risks if we demand they get inspection and approval at every step of the process. We must place faith in our coworker’s commitment to stewardship. Do we really believe in their faithfulness to utilize the organizations time and resources in a God honoring way that will produce the greatest yield?
Self-management sounds like flowing green pastures of freedom at first, and it is. But higher degrees of freedom only last with greater degrees of responsibility. Entering these meadowlands means we can no longer hide in the barns of blaming bosses for our own mistakes, laziness or indifference. To be treated like and adult requires acting like one.

66Pree, Max De. Leading Without Power: Finding Hope In Serving Community. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2003. 125-126

Throughout our research we have discovered a myriad of groups and organizations that have developed accountability processes that include sound habits and principles. Doug Kirkpatrick shares Morning Star’s key principles each worker promises to uphold:
“People are used to having a boss. And they do have bosses in a self-managed environment. They are their own bosses. Beyond that, the mission of the company is their boss—it should guide all their actions on behalf of the company. And even beyond that—each and every commitment that they make and the colleagues to whom they make the commitment is their boss for that commitment.”68 Integrity is the single word definition Morning Star uses to sum up keeping commitments. It sounds very simplistic, but this means we do what we say we are going to do. Jesus said, “Let your yes mean yes and let your no mean no.”69

No Use of Force Against Other Persons

There are certainly times command authority is needed. The recent Covid-19 epidemic crisis is a sterling example of the need for stay-at-home directives from national and local authorities in order to starve the flu virus of human hosts. But when life is going as it should be commanding others doesn’t work in a free society. Even family members don’t respond well to being ordered around. No one person at Morning Star has unilateral authority to fire anyone. This does not mean that people are not fired. It is how they are dismissed that is different. We will get to the dismissal process later.

As we have said earlier, leadership is an issue of power. Supervisors and superiors have power over others. When we eliminate the rank and title of superiors, we take away the command authority of one person ordering another person what to do.
If a member senses certain actions or attitudes of a fellow worker is in conflict with the overall mission, she is obligated to speak directly to the other person concerning the matter. Placing supreme value on communication at the micro level can often circumvent larger crisis or conflict. Sometimes simple miscommunication or mere assumption leads to perceptions that are wrong. Seeking and speaking the truth in love is the way of the Spirit of God and should be a guiding rule for our organizations as well as personal lives.
Ori underscores a vital principle of decentralization in The Starfish and The Spider, “An open system doesn’t have central intelligence; the intelligence is spread throughout the system. Information and knowledge naturally filter in at the edges, closer to where the action is.”70

If we value freedom, we will value the sharing of truth. Systemically this means we commit to installing a truth system. Truth systems are organically open systems. Such systems are a requirement for life and renewal. For instance, the human body shares information freely. The brain doesn’t withhold information from the little toe. For a living system such as a church—the body of Christ—when information stops formation stops. And when formation ceases healthy life begins to seize up.

IN + Formation = continually forming or developing

The way information flows reveals everything about command and control or freedom and release in an organization. In top-down organizations top people decide what lower level people are privy to and when they are allowed to receive privileged information. The conjecture is that employees are only marginally trusted. Organics come into play in control-based organizations. Where you sow distrust, you reap distrust. The atmosphere of such associations is occupied with suspicion and distrust.

In self-managed churches and business everyone is a VIP! Information is free to be accessed by everyone. This means financials are available in every sphere of the organization. Frederic Laloux speaks to the importance of such open policies

In the absence of hierarchy, self-managing teams need to have all available information to make the best decisions.

Any information that isn’t public will cause suspicion (why else would someone go through the trouble to keep it secret?), and suspicion is toxic for organizational trust.

Informal hierarchies reemerge when some people are in the know while others are not.71

Carefully consider the word communication. The root of it is commune—which includes community and cooperative. In a genuine community communication is a two-way street. People are not talked down to because no one is above another. Anyone is welcomed to ask anything about any issue.

But I also want you to think about how this keeps your significance from getting blown up into selfimportance. For no matter how significant you are, it is only because of what you are a part of. An enormous eye or a gigantic hand wouldn’t be a body, but a monster. What we have is one body with many parts, each its proper size and in its proper place. No part is important on its own. Can you imagine Eye telling Hand, “Get lost; I don’t need you”? Or, Head telling Foot, “You’re fired; your job has been phased out”? As a matter of fact, in practice it works the other way—the “lower” the part, the more basic, and therefore necessary. You can live without an eye, for instance, but not without a stomach. When it’s a part of your own body you are concerned with, it makes no difference whether the part is visible or clothed, higher or lower. You give it dignity and honor just as it is, without comparisons. If anything, you have more concern for the lower parts than the higher. If you had to choose, wouldn’t you prefer good digestion to full-bodied hair? The way God designed our bodies is a model for understanding our lives together as a church: every part dependent on every other part, the parts we mention and the parts we don’t, the parts we see and the parts we don’t. If one-part hurts, every other part is involved in the hurt, and in the healing. If one-part flourishes, every other part enters into the exuberance. You are Christ’s body—that’s who you are! You must never forget this. Only as you accept your part of that body does your “part” mean anything. 1 Corinthians 12:18-31 The Message

If we suppress the gifts of any member, we suppress the Spirit of God working through the gifts, talents, wisdom, and experience of those same people. But when we open the floodgates of information flow and decision-making, we expose the entire organization to the Spirit’s treasure trove of innovation and

creativity. It all rests on the free flow of information and the freedom for all team members to be able to speak openly and honestly to one another without fear or threat of retribution.
Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.

15:14 NKJV

The language of the New Testament is that the church is a family. The Apostle Paul says he is assured that the body of Christ is capable of carrying out the task of admonishing one another. Remember, the letter to the Romans was not addressed to elders, senior leaders, or a board or committee. The apostle does not say, “You need senior staff to admonish the workers.” He places the responsibility of warning and exhorting one another squarely upon the shoulders of the collective community of believers. This raises the bar on expectations of maturity for the “normal” everyday saint.

The letter to the Romans was written to the priesthood of believers, the community of saints (Romans 1:7). This is an issue of competency and the Holy Spirit is saying the people who are filled with the Spirit of God are very much capable of holding one another accountable.

Doug Kirkpatrick’s book is titled Beyond Empowerment because he believes “Employee empowerment implies that one person is transferring power to another person. In the real world, what is given can be taken away. In self-management, colleagues already have all the power they need to make anything happen they want to have happen from the moment they start work. Self-management is beyond empowerment. Self-management is power itself.”72

Leaders do not empower followers. Rather, leaders create the systemic freedom and cultural conditions for the entire community to exercise their gifts and abilities. The community as a whole has the frontline responsibility for social order and group harmony. Throughout the epistles, verse after verse underscores the responsibility of the brothers and sisters, the servantship community, to rebuke when necessary and edify at all times. Below are but a sampling of such passages:

•Honor one another (Romans 12:10)

•Build up one another (Romans 14:19; 1 Thess. 5:11; Heb. 3:13; 10:25)

•Warn and exhort one another (Romans 15:14; Col. 3:16)

•Provide discipline among yourselves (1 Cor. 5:3-5)

•Bear one another’s overwhelming burdens (Gal. 5:13; 6:2)

•Submit to one another (Eph. 5:21)

•Teach one another (Col. 3:16)

•Incite one another to “love and good works” (Heb.10:24)

•Confess sins to one another (James 5:16)

Church discipline has been categorized as a leadership function and duty. The scripture says otherwise. It is not to be carried out by a hierarchical few. It is the responsibility of everyday saints, normal people with the Spirit of God in them. Siblings throughout the faith community are called to be accountable to

and for one another. This certainly applies to everyone that works in your church staff or faith-based organization of business.73

Mutual oversight is the theme of the New Testament. Hierarchy is not only absent from the narratives of Jesus and the epistles, it is forbidden. This is not to say that people do not have responsibilities they must answer for. But no place do we find the idea of a boss/employee arrangement in the New Testament. What we do see is a commitment to self-discipline, accountability to the group as a whole, and personal responsibility.

In Leadership on The Other Side, author and church growth expert Bill Easum shares three essential characteristics for the sustainability of a culture of servant disciples practicing mutual accountability and oversight:

•Competency: Those who function as a team must be able to count on the other members of the team to do what they say they will do.

•Consistency: They have to be able to count on the other team members to be there for them.

•Integrity: They have to be able to take team members at their word.

Responsibly mature disciples are servants who are faithful and need not be evaluated by a centralized office of command and control.

Systems of self-management are only sustainable in cultures of high collegiality. Team members consistently submit themselves to other members, maintaining a humble posture that invites forthright critique on an ongoing basis from their peers while keeping in mind several questions:

•Am I stewarding the resources I have been entrusted with integrity?

•Is there pride in me that’s keeping me from soliciting advice from others around me?

•Am I being faithful (giving my best) to my calling?

•Is there someone here who could do what I’m doing better than I can?

In conclusion, we are now at a pivotal moment in our journey. The Movement Starfish gives us a definition for church as movement that is inspiring, yet grounded; magnificent, yet measurable in five points of multiplication; Spirited-empowered, and also strategic. We begin with that end in mind.

The next three Starfish, the Light Load Leader, Structure and Self-Management Starfish, create the right leadership culture for the vision of the Movement Starfish to rise from. But, the real test of leadership, in our opinion, is that of discipleship. Although, we started with leadership culture, leadership culture actual flows out of and builds on a disciple-making culture. In essence, these are two sides of the same coin.

In the pursuit of the Movement Starfish, everything rises and falls on our ability to make disciples who make disciples, what we are calling reproducing owners of the faith. If a healthy multiplicative, transformative disciple-making culture is in place, a healthy multiplicative leadership culture naturally begins to arise. If both of the environments – disciple-making and leadership development are healthy, you’ll end up producing healthy microchurches, healthy hubs, and healthy networks, as well. Disciple-making and leadership development are the basic building blocks of all those larger expressions. As you’ll see, it’s that same fractal that is reproduced, all the way up into the larger expressions like Hubs and Networks. Now, we begin our journey into then, what we believe are the two most critical Starfish because they help us define and cultivate disciple-making environments and ecosystems.

# Section Three A Culture
Chapter 7

The Owner-Making Ingredient Starfish
You can do more with twelve disciples than you can do with twelve hundred religious consumers.

–Alan Hirsch

Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all

nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have

commanded you. And surely I am with you always,

to the very end of the age.”

Matthew 18:18-20.

“From Mexico to Alaska, there has been a massive die off of starfish, estimates are in the tens of millions. This is one of the largest mortality events…ever observed in the ocean,” states Ben Miner, Associate Professor in Marine and Estuarine Program of Western Washington University. Since 2013, a disease has caused starfish to die in record-breaking numbers up and down the U.S. west coast.

Scientist haven’t been able to find a “smoking gun,” and aren’t sure what causes the disease. 74

The syndrome known as sea star wasting disease (SSWS) causes starfish to lose limbs and eventually disintegrate, leaving behind the tell-tale sign of the disease, a pile of white goo.

Miner continues, “One of the greatest threats in a massive die-off is that all the adults, which are the only starfish capable of reproduction, are gone. Which means no new babies.” 75

Many faith communities in the West are experiencing a similar crisis: a massive fallout of engaged, reproducing owners of the faith.

The Humanist states, “We’re reaching the end of the alphabet – and the end of a religious statistical oddity in the United States. Generation Z, more so than the preceding Generation…is demonstrating a telling and permanent downtrend in religious identity.”76

The emptying of organized faith communities is a real phenomenon.

Scott Thumma, director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research predicts, “In the next twenty years, you’ll have half as many open congregations as now.”77 In 2017, the Public Religion Research Institute reported a dramatic, rapidly increasing decline that is easy to see when making comparisons over time. 78 In 1986, for example, 10 percent of young adults gave the answer “none” to a PRRI survey asking their religion. In the 2016 that figure had shot up to 39 percent. When you pull back the camera lens to include all generations, you discover what may be the most

consequential shift in America’s spiritual landscape, the rise of the religiously unaffiliated. This trend emerged in the early 1990’s, when only six percent of Americans identified their religious affiliation as “None.” Today, one-quarter of Americans claim no formal religious identity, making this group the largest “religious group” in the US. Furthermore, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing at the time of this writing, with churches unable to gather, without a doubt, there will be a culling of congregations who simple won’t be viable post-pandemic.

If the goal of every faith community is a starfish, the spontaneous reproduction of faith-filled, flourishing, owners of the faith, then we are in a crisis.

A good news needle is hidden in this data haystack, however.

When one digs deeper, the rise of the “Nones” is not attributable to a decline in the percentage of people who express spiritual and religious enthusiasm, which according to 2018 General Social Survey at the University of Chicago is 34 percent, a number which has remained unchanged over the 30 years.79

Who are the folks who are converting to the “Nones”? The Unengaged Middle.

In American faith, we see the same trend that has been growing in the political and economic realms, the middle is dropping out, with sides forming at each end of the continuum.

According to the GSS surveyors, it is the faith affiliation group entitled, “Somewhat Strong,” where the significant drop off is occurring. These are the folks in our faith communities who are neither fully

76 https://thehumanist.com/magazine/september-october-2018/features/faith-and-faithlessness-by-generation-the-decline-and-rise-are-real

77 https://thehumanist.com/magazine/september-october-2018/features/faith-and-faithlessness-by-generation-the-decline-and-rise-are-real

78 https://www.prri.org/research/prri-rns-poll-nones-atheist-leaving-religion/

engaged or fully disengaged. As a faith leader, it’s likely your thinking, “Most of my people fit in that category.”

Realize this means the rise in “Nones” has nothing to do with the intrinsic power of faith to transform and bring meaning to a person’s life. The rise in “Nones” is not about a general societal decline in spiritual or religious fervor.

The rise in Nones is about a lack of meaningful engagement, a lack of personal ownership and a loss of faith identity within those already within our faith communities.

Therein lies the good news. A Starfish movement in our faith community can begin by reengaging and activating those already within the influence of our faith communities. Within the prevailing model, the congregation becomes the fishing pond from which one can identify and then invite others into an intentional owner-making experience. Or for those who are more missionally engage, the new owners of the faith, emerge from the Harvest field. In the great DDM’s and CPM’s around the world, most of the mobilization is from the Harvest. But here in America, we also need to mobilize from the Church toward the Harvest.

Either way, if we don’t help folks experience the flourishing life and transformation of faith, if they don’t become radical owners of their faith, not only will it not be reproduced in the lives of others, they will continue leaving in record numbers. Why? The larger cultural expectations for engagement in a faith community have disappeared. Fifty years ago, it was expected that one would go to church on Sunday. That day is gone. Without the outside social pressure to engage a church, that means faith leaders must develop a culture within their faith communities that catalyze internal motivation and personal ownership within people. Or it means missional engagement with the spiritual curious, then immediately upon and even preceding their conversion, we are developing immediate ownership and reproduction practices.

If we learn to create the right environments, Intentional Owner-Making Environments, the power of the Starfish can be awakened! The starfish faith community rises and falls on its ability to make personal transformed owners of the faith, who can in turn influence others, lovingly and relationally, to experience the same transformation and ownership deep in their souls.

What does it look like when the Unengaged Middle becomes Transformed, Reproducing Owners of Faith?

Take a look at this whiteboard drawing.

Behind it is a story of those in “The Unengaged Middle,” who were

awakened to become radical, reproducing owners of their faith. When we say radical, we must clarify. We live in a world, where religious radicals are committing unbelievable atrocities every day in the name of God. Understandably, we are leery of any conversation where the idea of radical is intersected with idea of religion. When, we use this word, however, we are referring to its most ancient meaning.

Radical was formed from the Latin adjective radicalis, which simply meant "of or relating to a root." How do we get to simpler, more elemental expression of the faith? The folks in the following story found themselves stepping out of unengaged religious consumption into a more radical experience of transforming faith.

This is a story that has been unfolding in Kansas City for eight years. What started with Brian Phipps, a frustrated pastor, has become a disciple-making movement with disciples reproducing to the fourth generation and beyond, on multiple strands. Disciple is the term Jesus used to describe what we are calling reproducing owners of the faith. Whether you are reading this as a church leader, business leader, or leader of any societal organization, we have a shared goal of seeing others own the mission of our organization and reproduce other owners of the mission.

Brian is also one of my best friends and the originator of the first iteration of what he called the Intentional Disciple-Making Environment. Through our shared work, we have now expanded to what you will read in the next six chapters.

In his own words, “Eight years ago, here I was a pastor, the paid professional holding two master’s degrees, having attended over fifty leadership conferences, and having consumed endless books and articles on discipleship. Yet it had slowly dawned on me, I had never personally multiplied disciples. Yes, I had led many small groups and discipleship programs, but the results were discouraging and not reproductive. That was very hard to accept, but it created a humble posture of learning inside of me.”

He goes on, “I did not know what to do differently than what I had done before. I did the only thing I knew how to do. I repented. With a new humility and earnestness, I committed to obey whatever Jesus asked of me, if he would guide me step by step. The first thing he told me was to put an end date on my current men’s small group. I had to QUIT discipling people that were not interested in discipling others. With excitement, I explained the end date of the group and I shared this vision of becoming disciplemakers. It went over like a lead balloon. Some of the guys were offended that I was ending their group. The rest of the guys didn’t think they were up to the task. Disciple-making…isn’t that for the religious professionals? Here’s what I told them, “I will personally disciple them for one year in order to help them become disciples who can make disciples.” Sounds simple, right? Well, I did not even know which ones to invite! I simply prayed for a few weeks for Jesus to show me His choices. He did. Clearly. Of the original group, five of those guys committed to going on the journey to become disciple-makers. Each of those men invited an apprentice to join them. In so doing, Jesus had already led me to move from a twogeneration disciple-making model to a three-generation model.”

Ken was one of those five guys that Brian discipled into disciple-making. At that point, Ken’s marriage had just taken a significant hit when his wife discovered pornography on his computer. During that year of developing character and calling with Brian, Ken’s marriage was restored, and his family was transformed. In the last eight years, Ken has made disciples who have made disciples who have made disciples who have made disciples. It literally totals hundreds of people in that “strand” from Brian to Ken downstream four generations and beyond.

Jim, at the beginning of the journey, was depressed and drinking too much. Over the year, Jim broke his addiction by finding what he truly needed in Jesus and has more than 50 disciples downstream in his disciple-making chain reaction. One of Jim’s disciple-making beneficiaries is a pastor in our area who was in crisis. This leader did not have healthy accountability and was starting to engage in an emotional affair. Jim, “the lay person,” discipled “the pastor” in developing his character and calling, which completely redirect his life and saved his marriage. Now, that pastor is multiplying disciples through his church.

Brian concludes, “I have personally discipled over 120 people in these last eight years. Over 30% of them have taken up the vision of being disciples who make disciples.”

That may not feel like a great return on investment…only 30%. But, Starfish movements “slow is the new fast.” You can’t microwave reproducing, transformed owners of the faith.

You could say we develop owners in a crockpot, slow cooking over time. Investing in small numbers of people over time has always been the way of Starfish movements. If spectators become owners who can create other owners, eventually multiplication kicks in.

Consider Brian’s words carefully, “That 30% have similar stories to mine, in their wake. The map you see on that white board, which I drew in 2015, conservatively represents more than 2,500 people who are experiencing transformation in their character and feel a deep sense of personal calling. That story began in 2010 with me and the original five owners, working out at only a 20% success rate over five years. Due to the speed up of exponential multiplication, which is now working in our favor, that number has jumped from 2500 to 4,000 in the last two and 1/2 years!”

You’re probably wondering, what is going on underneath the surface in these stories? How does that happen? What are the ingredients needed to fuel this kind of transformation and multiplication among ordinary people? How do I, as a faith leader, intentionally create disciple-making environments of faith? We’ve adopted the language of “owner-making “ to open up the aperture for those readers who are from different sectors, outside of the religious sector, to better conceive that these principles do apply to your setting.

Over the next five chapters, we will explore the key ingredients for what we call an Intentional OwnerMaking Environment (henceforth, IOE). An IOE contains the five essential ingredients to create transformative and multiplicative ownership of the faith. Again, it is our conviction, that these elements, although translated differently, are essential for reproducing owners of the mission in other sectors of society, as well.

THE OWNER-MAKING INGREDIENTS STARFISH
Ingredient #1: Outcome-Focused: The Key Questions:

How clearly can we articulate the outcomes of internal transformation?

To what degree is the goal of our faith community the experience of personal transformation into the likeness of God?

To what degree are people in our faith community discovering and living into their personal calling?

Ingredient #2: Habit-Fueled: The Key Questions:

How effectively do we help people develop personally meaningful spiritual habits?

How effectively do we help people develop sacred rhythms that feed their mind and souls?

Do we have experiential and relational pathways that make the development of faith habits normal?

Ingredient #3: Community-Forged:

The Key Questions:

Do we understand and engage all five spheres of community required for human flourishing?

How well do we help people creating overlapping social spaces that deepen their engagement in our faith community?

How well do we move people out of the privatized individualism trend into deep, meaningful faith community engagement?

Ingredient #4: Mission-Fixated: The Key Questions:

How well do help each person discover that the mission of faith involves the everyday spaces where we live, work, learn and play?

How well do help each person own the mission personally?

What resources, process, and tools do we provide to empower each person to own, apply, and innovate mission?

Ingredient #5: Content-Flavored: The Key Questions:

Do we have clarity on what the fractal of our faith is? What is our irreducible minimum?

How well do we pass on this fractal of faith in way that is generous and inclusive?

Is this passed on in way that moves beyond intellectual assent to integration into all of life?

Before we examine the ingredients of an IOE, let’s remember owner-making isn’t a microwave-activity, it’s a crockpot-lifestyle.

Flashback to the eighties. I remember the day we got our microwave, that came with the much-hyped, space age promise of time saving efficiency. Food will be ready in a flash, Gordon! Right away, I was ready to strap on my space suit and take off. First, I took a hotdog, placed it in a bun, and nuked it for a couple minutes. MMMMM, that bun was as hard as cardboard. Not to be discouraged, I moved quickly to scrambled eggs next and ended up with a rubberized omelet. Delish! The only upside that day was when I discovered that marshmallows blow up when microwaved.

My Mom, who was a home-economics major in college, never took to the microwave, beyond making popcorn. She preferred slow cooking. Many a day, the crock-pot was the instrument of choice. One of her classic meals was porcupines. The imagery might not sound too appetizing but trust me they were the pièce de résistance.

Porcupines are meatballs embedded with rice, marinated in an Italian herbs and tomato sauce. She’d tuck those meatballs in the sauce, stick the crockpot on low, and let them simmer all day. Oh, the whole house was filled with the most delicious aroma! My stomach is grumbling now as I think about it. Slow cooking those meatballs in the crock-pot made them so tender, allowing the sauce to soak entirely through the meatball, saturating every last bite with such flavor.

Jump forward a few decades. After a tumble down the stairs, post-surgery my wife was bed-ridden for six weeks. We still had three kids to feed daily, as well as, some neighborhood children to feed on a regular basis, as that was a part of our family rhythm as “missionaries” in our neighborhood. Overnight,

I was commissioned with all the cooking duties. In an effort to be efficient, I became the “Commander of the Crockpot.” With a little advanced planning, I could get the ingredients in the crockpot early morning before work, let it simmer all day, come home after work, and offer up a homemade masterpiece for the family and neighbors. Eventually, we figured out the go-to meals for rotation.

I had no advanced culinary degrees. I didn’t need to be a five-star Michelin chef. The best crock recipes were ones that friends shared with me. One of them even had a database of such recipes! It didn’t take a ton of food preparation to get a meal together. We had some great meals to share! My wife will even brag on my cooking now. But, it’s not that impressive. Really, virtually anyone can become the master of the crockpot.

Disciple-making isn’t about being the expert. It’s about learning and adding back in the basic key ingredients any cook can find, which the people of God have known and practiced for centuries. It doesn’t require an advanced degree, lots of complex preparation, or complicated skills.

You can’t microwave disciples. It takes time, accountability, community, consistency and practice. As the key ingredients simmer inside those containers, faith-owners are tenderized and transformed by the Spirit. Soon they themselves are ready to share the meal and show others how to make the meal. The culmination of history, as pictured in the book of Revelation is seen as the Wedding Feast of the Lamb (Revelation 19:6-9). People from every tribe will be gathered to celebrate the great Union of God and humanity. These are the people who have come to own the mission of Jesus to heal, redeem and restore all things. The authors love to think of millions of people personally owning the mission of universal flourishing, which we believe transcends any one particular faith tradition or denomination.

By the way, I’m positive my Mom’s porcupines will be on the menu at the Wedding Feast! Let’s now take a look at each of the ingredients we want to put into the crockpot.

Chapter 8 Outcome-Focused

Owner-Making Environment Ingredient #1

You’ve heard it said, “Begin with the end in mind.”

Too often, the desired outcome of most discipleship programs is what I call the “data dump.” If we can just open up the top of people skulls and poor enough good content, mission accomplished. You’ve been “discipled.”

The outcome of discipleship, however, isn’t simply a transfer of information. The goal is transformation by incarnation. The word becomes flesh and blood in the lives of Jesus followers, disciples.

Sheldon Vanuaken proclaims, in his classic book A Severe Mercy, “The best argument for Christianity is Christians: their joy, their certainty, their completeness. But the strongest argument against Christianity is also Christians--when they are somber and joyless, when they are self-righteous and smug in complacent consecration, when they are narrow and repressive, then Christianity dies a thousand deaths.”

Sheldon is reminding those of us from the Christian tradition, that Jesus’ plan was not to start a movement full of people who call themselves Jesus’ disciples, but remain cranky, prideful, judgmental, dishonest, selfish, lustful, self-righteous, and religious until they die and go to heaven. His plan was to begin a movement of the transformed heart. To recreate men and women who are radiantly loving at the core. The Apostle Paul describes it this way,

For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son. Romans 8:29

For a Christian, the outcome of true faith-ownership is this: I become like Jesus in my character, within the very essence of my being. We consider this our highest calling.

Similarly, the ultimate goal of all mature spirituality, within healthy expressions of the Abrahamic religions, at least, is to reflect the image of God. Humanity’s transformation into the likeness of God is the ultimate goal.

Wisdom from each of these Abrahamic traditions can converge to give us clarity on the true outcome of transformative faith. Philosopher Ken Wilber, articulates this goal when he describes what he sees as the two transcendent shared outcomes of religion,

... Religion itself has always performed two very important, but very different functions. One, it acts as a way of creating meaning for the separate self: it offers myths and stories and tales and narratives and rituals that, taken together, help the separate self-make sense of, and endure, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. This function of religion does not usually or necessarily change the level of consciousness in a person; it does not deliver radical transformation.”

But two, religion has also served—in a usually very, very small minority—the function of radical transformation and liberation. This function of religion does not fortify the separate self, but utterly shatters it—not consolation but devastation, not entrenchment but emptiness, not

complacency but explosion, not comfort but revolution—in short, not a conventional bolstering of consciousness but a radical transmutation and transformation at the deepest seat of consciousness itself.80

Faith leaders often settle for the first outcome of faith, which is usually a sense of meaning and comfort. However, true disciple-making requires people aspire to the outcome of radical transformation. This outcome moves people beyond ego-centric goals of comfort and security toward the greater heights of transformation, which manifests itself in a transformed life.

That is why Jesus said, “Blessed are the poor in spirit (Matt 5:3).” Recognizing our own poverty and brokenness is the beginning of transformation. The greatest disciple-making movements globally, have always sparked most easily among marginalized people groups, simply because they are already “blessed” with a deep awareness that “something has to change!” The “poor” are vastly more selfaware than “rich,” who have been lulled asleep by affluence, success, and comfort.

Periodically, an event like the COVID-19 pandemic or 9/11, will shake millions of people simultaneously from their spiritual slumber. Usually, however, it is the everyday experience of pain, loss, defeat, failure, bankruptcy, addition, and the like that prepare us for transformation in our character. We feel the gap between who we are and who we want to be. Then, we realize, “I need to change.” This is where the hope of the first outcome comes in.

Outcome #1: Character

What does this God-like character look like? In other words, what is this God like? Thomas Keating states, “The chief fruit of Old Testament spirituality was a long-term education that gradually weaned the Chosen People away from their narrow concept of God as one among many other Near Eastern gods to the Transcendent One. The monotheistic God is the great gift of Israel to humanity.”81

Unlike the fickle and cruel pantheon of tribal gods the ancient world and archaic religion sought to appease, this God described himself to Moses this way:

The Lord passed before him, and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord,

a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for the thousandth generation,[a] forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.

Exodus 34:6-7 (NRSV)

This became the faith fractal that Israel used to summarize the character of God. Five marvelous dimensions that describe the core of what we can become: Merciful (in Hebrew, rhm), Compassionate/Gracious (hnn), Steadfast and Unconditional in Love (hsd), Relentlessly Faithful (‘emeth) and Forgiving (ns’). Building upon this Old Testament foundation, the apostle Paul in the New

Testament provides another portrait of this character in full bloom, with what he calls The Fruit of the Spirit:

…the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.

Galatians 5:22-23 (NRSV)

Notice Paul does not say the traits of the Spirit, the components parts of the Spirit, the aspects of the Spirit. He says, “The fruit of the Spirit.”

How does this fruit grow?

In the New Testament, the guiding metaphors are organic. In our time, the guiding metaphors are mechanical. On this side of the industrial revolution, we manufacture things. That metaphor dominates the way we think about change. Think of how many times you’ve said things like, “I’ve got to make this happen.”

This is profoundly important as it applies to developing the fruit of the Spirit. Paul uses the word fruit deliberately because he is invoking a metaphor of botanical growth. That speaks not only to the product of change, but the process of change. This type of internal, spiritual transformation is not simply manmade.

The difference between mechanical and organic change is the difference between striving and yielding.

You can restrain your character temporarily through striving, like squeezing a nerf ball to a smaller size. But you didn’t really change it, you just restrained it, and then as soon as you let the pressure off, it snaps back. That’s standard operating procedure, “I will STRIVE and MAKE the change happen.” But then my will power runs out and then, my character “SNAPS!” back.

All you get from striving is a morally restrained heart, not a spiritually transformed heart. Striving for a morally restrained heart is like eating manufactured wax fruit rather than feasting on fresh organic fruit. They may look the same on the outside from a distance, but they sure taste different.

Instead of the striving-experience of “squeeze and snapback” which leads to frustration, we can discover the yielding-experience of “remain and respond” which leads to transformation. We find this power source in the Spirit, which makes the person of God in Jesus Christ, fully available to all those who believe.

“I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.” John 15:5 (NIV)

Remain in me.

In other words, stay in the Spirit, walk with Spirit, and spend your day aware that the Spirit is available to you. If you do, the fruit of radical, internal transformation – mercy, compassion, love, joy, faithfulness, wisdom, patience, kindness, goodness – will slowly grow in us.

Think of how it is that fruit grows in nature. There are forces that the plant can simply open up and receive: sunlight, water, and oxygen. No one has ever heard an apple tree in an orchard grunting with effort to produce fruit.

Transformation begins with receiving what the Spirit is giving. Also, respond to me.

For a truly productive harvest to be realized, a gardener must also learn to respond or cooperate with these forces by mindfully engaging age-old practices that are essential. One must learn to tend the garden and weed out that which threatens the slow-growing harvest.

When it comes to experiencing radical transformation in our character, we remain by first trusting that God is gracious. The Spirit will provide the light and oxygen our souls need to grow. Secondly, we remain by practicing the ancient habits of soul gardening that keep us connected to the Spirit. As we “remain,” the Spirit will guide us and prompt us to new action or explorations of new avenues, then we respond with engagement and obedience to that prompting.

Along the way, we are transformed in character, which is the first essential outcome we must focus on. Additionally, along the way, that responsive life leads to a discovery in calling, which is the second outcome focus.

Outcome #2: Calling

Whereas character involves our becoming, our calling involves our doing.

We are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. Ephesians 2:10

According to Ephesians 2, every follower of Jesus receives a sacred summons, what is commonly referred to as a calling. However, this term has been used almost exclusively for pastors, missionaries, or other leaders in vocational ministry. This tragedy has not simply squelched the potential impact of the church in America… is has put it in a chokehold.

It is time for every person to pursue, locate, and make the highest possible impact through their personal calling. I believe Jesus has called every follower of Jesus in a unique way that would meet every need in every community if they would only have a way to locate that personal calling.

Do you see how much is riding on this? As meaningful as volunteering can be inside the programs of the centralized church, ultimately God’s vision is to fill everything in every way with all that Jesus is (Ephesians 1:22-23).

In Ephesians 1:22-23, Paul declares, “And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.”

Paul says that Jesus is filling everything every way. He is big enough to fill every need, big enough to be the solution to every problem, big enough to redeem every mistake, big enough to restore everything broken. This is God’s Master Mission to fill everything every way with all that He is.

What would that even look like? Saturation. Imagine the city you live in like an aquarium. Think of water filling an aquarium, completely surrounding and engulfing every object within the tank, including the rocks, the coral, and the artificial castle; 100 percent of the available surface area saturated by the water.

What would it be like for your whole city to be saturated with the beauty, justice, and good news of Jesus, nothing untouched, everything submerged? God wants to see all of your city, every corner of culture, saturated with all that He is: Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, etc.

Is that the kind of city you want to live in?

Where there is isolation, we bring community, because our God is divine community. Where there is poverty, we bring abundance, because our God is the God of abundance. Where this is violence, we bring peace-making, because our God is peace.

Where there is racism or misogyny, we bring equality and dignity because God’s image is stamped on every single one of us.

Where there is disease, we bring healing because our God is a healer. How will He do that? Through us.

In Ephesians, we are described as “his body, the fullness of him.” We are invited to be his body, his hands and feet in action on the ground. We are invited to be the fullness of him, making that fullness tangible where we live, work, learn, and play.

In other words, God’s people have been mobilized to fill every corner of culture for the purpose of making the love, joy, beauty and shalom of God tangible there. Discovering and living into your personal calling is the way you find your part in that Masterpiece. Each of us has a one of a kind Masterpiece Mission. As we each discover and live into it, alongside others, those mosaics make up the Masterpiece, the fullness grows with each person who discovers and lives out their calling.

Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Every time a person is unaware or unengaged in their Masterpiece Mission, the tank is emptied of that part of the fullness. Individually, without knowing our personal calling, we feel “empty,” lacking purpose, significance, and meaning. Corporately, our faith communities, cities and world feel “empty,” lacking the fullness that God intends to fill up the needs and emptiness that vex and oppress us.

There are two types of people in the world: Those who knowimagetheir masterpiece mission and those who do not. Most people settle for life in the second category, which contributes to an aching sense of purposelessness. No wonder we see so little effect in our culture.

Currently, many churches do have a process to activate volunteers into programs. As helpful as that is, it doesn’t not address the larger purpose of every owner of the faith knowing their unique personal calling. Volunteering is a good beginning, but it is not the endzone. It’s time for every faith community to have a personal calling discovery and deployment process. That discovery process may begin with volunteering within the programs of a faith community but will ultimately emphasize the endzone of engagement in personal calling where you live, work, learn, and play. When that happens, our faith

communities cease to be cul-de-sac congregations and start operating like the Hubs in Jerusalem or Ephesus, launching people and communities out on mission, all over our city and region.

Helping ordinary folks discover and then be deployed into their calling is essential to intentional ownermaking environments. There are many ways to do gift assessment and calling discovery. Here in our movement in Kansas City we have created a calling discovery and development process.

We call it GPS.

With the invention of the Global Positioning System, navigation has been revolutionized. The signals from the satellites triangulate your exact position and then can provide clarity on how to get to your destination. Wouldn’t it be great if there was a GPS for the soul? What if there was a spiritual technology that could help you locate your unique calling? There is.

We want every disciple to learn about the God-given “soul-technology” of GPS – their gifts, passions, and story. Our calling is primarily expressed as we discover, develop, and deploy our Gifts in our area of Passion as we allow Jesus to write our Story.
We are all born with natural gifts. These natural gifts are the product of God’s common grace given to all people. One of the aspects included in common grace is the set of natural gifts and talents we were born with (Psalm 139:13-16, Genesis 1:27, James 1:27). Our natural abilities come with an invitation to co-create with God, “fill the earth and subdue it,” so there will be order and flourishing in the world.

For those who have received amazing grace, we also have received spiritual gifts that we are given at our second birth. Our natural abilities can create wonderful things, but it is through our spiritual gifts that we discover a divine power to make disciples, strengthen the Church for her mission, fight demonic evil, and fully manifest the Kingdom in healing and power. Through the Holy Spirit and our spiritual gifts, God empowers his church to bless the world at large. Through our natural gifts we join God as cocreators in make culture and society a place of universal flourishing for all people.

“It was He who ‘gave gifts to men’...to build up the Body of Christ so we shall all come together to that oneness in our faith...and become mature...Then we shall no longer be children, carried by the waves and blown about by every shifting wind... Eph. 4:11, 13-14 (GN)
As we discover our God-assigned passions, we will begin to shift from a sense of feeling lost to gaining direction about our place in life. While our gifts outline some of that direction, when we add in an understanding of our passions we begin to tap into the power-source that internally motivates us to pursue our calling. Gifts shows us what we can do, our passions show us where and with whom we should use our gifts. Our passion involves a blending of passion for certain groups of people, certain causes, and the particular motivation (Ephesians 4:11-12) that fuels us as we look at the world.

“Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.” Ps. 37:4

Paul says that you and I are living letters being written by the Spirit of God. Your story isn’t just a list of facts and events. It’s a weaving of those facts and events into a narrative that has meaning, one that connects with God’s larger story. There is an arc to your story. Do you know how to read it? There are primary themes to your story. Are you aware of them? That arc and those themes will lead you to discover your calling.

Turn in the signals of your Gifts, Passions, and Story, you will be on your pathway of personal calling. You can discover more about GPS in a book I (Rob) cowrote with Brian Phipps called Find Your Place: Locating Your Calling Through Gifts, Passion, and Story (Exponential Series, Zondervan), or by visiting www.giftpassionstory.com, where you can find resources to help with full implementation in your context. We also highly recommend resources like Younique by Will Mancini and Dave Rhoades, More by Todd Wilson, and The Call by Os Guinness.

We believe assessments that move people towards a greater clarity on their calling will elevate every sector of society.

To review, we must focus on the Spirit’s outcomes, if we are to see reproducing owners of the faith made. Paul describes the work of the Spirit in two major categories, Fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:2223) and Gifts of the Spirit (Romans 12:6-8, 1 Corinthians 12:1-11, 1 Peter 4:11, Ephesians 4:11-13). In other words, character and calling are the outcomes we focus on. The result of focusing on these two outcomes is impact. As disciples allow the Spirit to cultivate His character in them, and as they allow the Spirit to demonstrate His power through their calling, it will create impact IN them and THROUGH them for good.

THE SPIRIT’S OUTCOMES: CHARACTER X CALLING = IMPACT
Here’s a simple way to remember the ingredient of Outcome Focused. We call it the Impact Equation, developed by the aforementioned Brian Phipps. The relative impact of developing character and calling can be seen by doing simple math through our impact equation, and that math is very telling.

If a person’s character is relatively low, perhaps a 3 on a scale from 1-10, and they have never even heard that Jesus has a calling on their life, perhaps a 1 on a scale from 1-10, then the relative impact they can expect to have is only 3 on a scale of 1-100. Here is the math...

3 (character)

x 1 (calling)

3 (Impact)

If this person starts to engage with a disciple-making experience that is focused on developing both character and calling, look what happens when their character goes up slightly, but their calling takes a quick jump because they engage a calling discovery and assessment process like GPS …

4 (character)

x 3 (calling)

12 (Impact)

As you can see, small steps can lead to significant impact. Impact, in turn, becomes the fuel that inspires more character and calling development. This person, for perhaps the first time in their life, is living on purpose. They want to protect and deepen that experience, so they accelerate the pursuit of character development. In turn, God honors that focus with more power through their calling. This changes the math even more...

6 (character)

x 5 (calling)

30 (Impact)

The Impact has doubled, and so has the fuel for further development because they are experiencing the fully-alive life (John 10:10) Jesus promised, as he lives through them in their context. Over time, as character and calling increase, so does impact! Our experience based on thousands of disciples made here in Kansas City is that an intentional focus on character and calling within the context community can leads to incredible increases in both areas.

Ingredient 1, Outcome-focused means Character X Calling = Impact!

As a faith leader, at this point, pause and consider the following:

To what degree is the goal of our faith community the experience of personal transformation into God-like character?

To what degree are people in our faith community experiencing growth in their character from the inside out through the Spirit verses temporary change through restraint and will power?

How clearly can we articulate the outcomes of internal transformation?

How clearly can the average person in our faith community articulate the outcomes of personal transformation?

To what degree are people in our faith community discovering and living into their personal calling?

Chapter 9 Habit-Fueled:

Owner-Making Ingredient #2

You have heard it said that practice makes perfect. Not true. No one reaches perfection. However, one change will make that phrase more accurate.

Practice makes permanent.

Our practices literally burn new neural pathways.

Neurologist, Curt Thompson, author of the Anatomy of the Soul says, “Anytime we think about changing the course of our mind, we’re talking about neuroplasticity. We’re talking about changing the way our neurons are actually firing. One of the most important elements of helping neuroplasticity to flourish is activating it through the use of attention. I like to describe attention as being the engine that pulls the rest of the train of the mind. There’s nothing that we do throughout the day that does not, in some way, shape or form, involve a shift in attention from one thing to another to another. That attentional change is crucial… if my life is going to be different, I’m going to have to change the focus of my attention and in so doing, activate neuroplasticity. If I want my brain to change, I need to change the focus of my attention.”82

Practice is a form of attentional and intentional change.

Practicing something regularly will make it a permanent habit, which can either benefit us or break us. Whether that’s a healthy pattern or a destructive pattern, we become what we practice. Practice makes permanent.

A spiritual habit or spiritual practice involves figuring out how to meaningfully engage a piece of spiritual technology that helps you both connect with the Spirit and cultivate your spiritual development, which includes every area of your life.

Consider the piece of spiritual technology called contemplative prayer. This is a form of prayer that transcends different faith traditions. During contemplative prayer, one remains silent in prayer, with the hope of moving beyond language to experience directly the mystery of God’s presence. Naturally, we will find our thoughts drifting toward the things we are anxious or preoccupied with. Therefore, pilgrims are encouraged to pick a meaningful word or phrase – perhaps one of God’s names like “I Am” or a word that is symbolic like Shalom that they return to, as a reminder to let those thoughts go, to find a way to return to the center, and simply be in God’s refreshing presence. Another important piece of this spiritual technology is mindfulness of your breathing. The average human breathes 12 to 15 breathes per minute. In contemplative prayer, we intentionally slow down our breathing to 6 to 8 breathes per second.

In so doing, we are practicing slowing down and focusing our attention and intention on our breathing and the always-available presence of God. We practice how to disengage the mind chatter that usually dominates all of our attention. We transcend our own judgments, defenses, and the other skipping

records in our minds. This practice also lowers the blood pressure and heart rate. This will reduce anxiety because anxiety is a mixture of preoccupation with future states along with high tension physical states.

If a pilgrim allows this habit to fuel their heart, mind, body, and soul for 15-20 minutes a day, once or twice a day, for six weeks, they will have radically enhanced their attentional muscle: the ability to separate from mind chatter to a place of rest and clarity. Almost without knowing it, they are practicing the virtues of peace and discernment. In these moments, the Spirit is working in them to transform them from the inside out.

This may seem extremely esoteric and unpractical to some, but it is profoundly practical. Let me prove it.

Imagine you’re in conflict with your teenage child, a spouse, or a co-worker. The situation, the energy level, and the language are escalating. Underneath this high stake’s conversation, is an easily trigged minefield ready to blow up the relationship. Your temper is rumbling and your about to blow like Mount Vesuvius.

You’ve been there before. Maybe recently. Maybe today!

Situations that feel dangerous to us activate neural networks in the lower brain that then lead us to automatic behaviors like fight or flight with very little higher brain function.

Who is more prepared to handle that situation with peace and discernment, the unpractical praying person or the practical non-praying person? Whose brain is going to have the better chance of operating out of higher brain function instead of devolving to the reptilian brain?

The unpractical praying person has been practicing through prayer how to focus their attention, how to disengage their own mind chatter, how to lower their breathing rate, how to lower their muscle tension, and how to be open to Spirit’s presence and wisdom as their source and strength.

Can you see how practical prayer is?

Patience, mercy, and discernment don’t just pop into existence in such trying situations. They must be practiced, and contemplative prayer is one way to do that.

When we begin to arrange our lives around these life-giving spiritual habits, transformation happens.

Paul describes the habit-fueled life this way in Philippians 2:13, “for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose,” in other words, I can’t change myself all by myself. I can do behavior modification, but only the Spirit of God, my faith fractal, and amazing grace can change a heart.

As a follower of Jesus, I know God works in me by grace through the gospel. But I’m not passive either. I’m not just treading water.

Paul also says in vs 12, “Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed--not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence--continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.”

While God works in me, I work out through spiritual practices. God works it in. I work it out.

Many have misread this and assume people must earn their salvation through good works. But that is totally out of line with what Paul says in the next verse, which we just read, “God is the one who is at work in you, offering unmerited grace.”

Within the Christian tradition, Salvation is God’s work from start to finish, accomplished through Jesus life, death, and resurrection. Paul is not asking them to earn their salvation, but rather to think through how to own their participation in their ongoing transformation.

Paul is articulating a revolutionary new approach to the habits that Jesus embodied. No longer do we see these habits or good deeds as the end in and of themselves that we muster up to please God or earn some new standing before Him. No longer are we measuring our goodness by the quantity of external religious behaviors.

The goodness Jesus is most concerned with is our internal character transformation.

By grace, we can become qualitatively different people internally. With this as the end goal, the habits become our way of cooperating with God, by responding to God’s grace. They move us into a flow where we are doing life with God and abiding in him. In this way, we place ourselves in a space where we see where God is moving, where grace is flowing, and we join in!

These activities are a way of raising the sail, so we can catch the wind of God. These activities are a way of keeping the radio tuned in so we can always hear the divine music and join the dance. These activities are a way to get our boat in the river and start rowing. But there is current underneath us that is already and always flowing.

The wind is blowing; we need to learn to raise my sail. The music is playing; we need to tune in. The current is flowing; we need to learn how get in the flow.

When these spiritual practices become habits, we join the Spirit regularly and intentionally in the process of transformation in both character and calling.

All IOE’s will introduce people to these practices of their faith tradition. More than that, IOE’s equip people to orient their entire lives around these habits.

Jesus’ life is the ultimate example of the habit-fueled life.

In other words, Jesus engaged in certain practices and he built the rhythms of his life around these practices. He practiced solitude by seeking retreat in creation. It was his practice to rise early, to be alone with His Father in prayer to be reminded of his identity. He would immerse His mind in the scriptures to remember the Story he alone could fulfill. He engaged in multiple levels of community on mission that provided the support and accountability he needed. He lived to bless others by listening to them, eating with them, serving them, and teaching them. Jesus practiced the habit of work and rest.

Come to me. Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. Matthew 11:29 The Message

Jesus practices became his habits that fueled the rhythms of his days, weeks, and years.

If Jesus felt like He needed to lead a habit-fueled life and He was the Son of God, how about us?

In our context at the Kansas City Underground Church, through intentional owner-making experiences, we walk slowly with people, helping them to deeply engage the following practices of Jesus and the early church.

Daily Scripture Engagement with a bias toward self-discovery, immediate application and sharing with others. We use a method called Discovery Bible Study. (Insert footnote here)

A daily combination of two forms of prayer, Contemplative Prayer and Missional Prayer. Contemplative forms of prayer that emphasize listening, silence, and centering like the Prayer of Exam. Missional forms of prayer focus on Intercession for and with others in prayer.

Healthy Accountability with a Triad and a group of Twelve trusted companions. Our accountability is mostly about proactive support and encouragement on goals that an individual has owned and publicly stated. Accountability is not the morality parole.

Active Service where you live, work, learn, play, or among a specific people group.

Journaling as a way to capture learning, prayers, and goals.

Sabbath (planning for daily, weekly, and annual work and rest rhythms).

Gospel Fluency, which is learning to speak and apply the Gospel to the deepest needs in ourselves and others.

Relational Rhythms in all five social spaces (Crowds, Social, Personal, Intimate, and Divine) that are sustained through the spiritual extended families of microchurches.

Calling Discovery and Optimization through reoccurring gift assessment and feedback (GPS).

Missional Engagement in a Neighborhood or Network through the Breath and BLESS Rhythms. BEGIN IN PRAYER

Breathe in: Listening Prayer. Breathe out: Missional Prayer.

# Listen And Engage

Breathe in: Listen to the story of your neighbors in your network or neighborhood. Breathe out: Engage relationship with them on their terms.

EAT

Breathe in: Eat with your spiritual family.

Breathe out: Party with your network or neighborhood.

# Serve

Breathe in: Let a Person of Peace serve you. Breathe out: Serve your network or neighborhood.

STORY:

Breathe in: Speak the Story of the Good News to yourself

Breathe out: Share the Story of how Jesus has changed you and how the Gospel changes everything.

Developing these practices is awkward at first, like learning to ride a bike. We are wobbly and inconsistent. It takes training wheels (time, supportive folks to help hold us up, and practice) for these

to become life-giving habits. Like any apprenticeship, you can’t learn all the practices at once, as they build on each other. Therefore, we have created four different IOE’s that vary in length from three months to twelve months in length to allow for this kind of incremental development. This slow play also always for these to truly become engrained, life-long habits. In our context we call them Intentional Disciple-Making Environments. Here’s a quick summary:

Followers Made: A six-month experience to discover character and calling, equipping you to be a disciple and make disciples.

Leaders Made: A twelve-month experience to discover servant leadership and what it means to lead a community on mission.

Missionaries Made: A three-month experience to develop a lifestyle around five incarnational rhythms that equip you to live as a missionary where you live, work, study, shop, and play.

The Microchurch Learning Community: A twelve-month experience that equips you step by step in planting a simple form of church, an extended spiritual family living on mission together, where you live, work, study, or play.

People join a guided cohort of about 12 folks with a guide, along the way, they learn to practice a given set of habits, and they are also equipped to empower others to do the same. We keep the bar high.

People in our IDE’s evaluate themselves on the level of transformation they are experiencing in their character, their calling, and the habits associated with each on a monthly basis. In fact, there’s a dashboard, that now lives inside of an app we’ve developed, Disciples Made, that houses these IDE’s. As people travel together, they can make their dashboard public to others in the group, which engenders support, encouragement and accountability. If we truly want to empower others, then we will embrace the parallel values of accountability and support. Through Disciples Made, we’ve seen what started with a handful of folks mostly, the unengaged middle, become a movement of thousands of transformed, reproducing owners of their faith.

In the last year, we’ve seen a 400% increase in the number of microchurches in the KC Underground. We didn’t organize these microchurches on the backside of weekend services at a large church. These were folks commissioned as missionaries to make new disciples in new contexts. Those loving missionaries saw new disciples emerge in new context and formed new extended spiritual families. If you’ve ever attempted this way of life, you know it is costly and not for the faint of heart. As we have reflected on such an encouraging level of multiplication of disciples and microchurches this year, we attribute it to three things. Extraordinary prayer and fasting, an increased focus on how to hear the Voice of God, and thirdly, most of missionaries have been through 1 or more of the four IDE’s I just listed. They are learning the ways of Jesus in community on mission with a focus on the Spirit’s outcomes.

As a faith leader, we ask you to pause and consider these habit-fueled questions

How effectively do we help people develop personally meaningful practices of faith?

How effectively do we help people develop sacred rhythms that feed their mind and souls?

Do we have experiential learning pathways that make the development of faith habits normal and equip them to share these pathways with others?

Do we create relational environments and mentoring relationship that allow people to apprentice themselves to others as they learn the spiritual practice?

Chapter 10 Community-Forged:

Owner-Making Ingredient #3

Thus far, we’ve said if we desire to see our faith communities create transformed owners of their faith, who can pass on that ownership to others, we will need to create Intentional Owner-Making Environments that contain five key ingredients. First of all, the goal of spiritual journey is not engagement in religious activity or attending a service. Rather, the goal of the spiritual journey is outcome-focused, transformation of our character toward the likeness of God and deployment into our personal calling. Content alone cannot change us. A massive data dump of doctrine won’t yield transformation. We need clarity on our faith fractal, the irreducible content of our faith. We make sure that content flavors and informs every area of our life. More to come on that in a bit. We also need to arrange our lives around spiritual practices that keep us in the flow of God’s transforming grace. He works in us; we work it out through spiritual habits.

The impact of those ingredients, however, cannot be successfully realized without the combination of the next two ingredients, Community-Forged and Mission-Fixated.

Consider this metaphor to understand why these are so essential.

Community and Mission are the containers in which outcome-focused, content-flavored, and habitfueled living must be held for transformation to take place. The first three are like water and the other two like a bowl. You can pour out those three, but without the bowl of community on mission to catch it, the water simply spills, and our thirst is never quenched. The container of community on mission catches what is being poured out, so it can be truly caught and then ingested. Only then will our thirsty souls will be filled. Spiritually transformed, owners of the faith are forged in community that is fixated on mission.

With the context in place, let’s explore what it means for disciples to be Community-Forged.

No one becomes a transformed owner of their faith apart from meaningful relationships. All great faith traditions have seen faith development like an apprenticeship. An apprenticeship is a journey toward mastery in a given area.

You don’t want to apprentice yourself to me on anything having to do with mechanics. Want to learn how to fix a carburetor? Watch YouTube, don’t ask me! If you ask me about a carburetor, I’ll reply, “Is that near the flux capacitor?” Explore my garage, you will find a handful of tools, all of which were given to me by my thoughtful brother-in-law. However, I do know a couple of guys who can fix anything mechanical, top to bottom. Their garages? It’s like walking into an episode of Fast N’ Loud or Counting Cars. Want to fix a car? Apprentice yourself to them.

Like any other pursuit, transformation is an apprenticeship that requires us to come alongside someone who is further down the road. We imitate them as they practice the craft in front of us. We are willing to be a beginner again and again, as we discover more and more areas of needed transformation in our lives. We are always students who need teachers. We are always players who need coaches. Then, we do the same for others. As we move forward, we are also always teachers who need students, coaches

who need players. Transformation requires imitation which requires relationship. Actually, it requires a whole framework of relationships made up of interwoven relational connections.

If you were able to clear all the surface dirt away in your local forest, you would discover the wood wide web. Beneath the surface of the forest, the trees aren’t in competition, they are interconnected, their roots intertwining into a network. Believe it or not the trees communicate and share information through this network. They even eat together by sharing nutrients. Large trees like Redwoods actually have shallow roots systems. Storms with heavy winds could easily bring these giants crashing to the ground. However, it rarely happens because Redwoods grow in clusters. They grow together, their roots intertwining, providing support for one another against the storms. They stand and grow together. We are all too shallow to grow alone. Transformation is forged in community.

The key words that describe most relationships in our culture are “scattered, busy, and temporary.” We’ve compartmentalized the different contexts that we live in so much that we’re like the entertaining plate spinners, running from network of relationships to the next, hoping we haven’t dropped anything sensitive or precious, or that we haven’t lost any relationships in the process. We’re attempting to navigate our relationships in so many different networks (our neighborhood circle, our workplace circle, our church circle, our school circle, our hobbies circle, our friends circle, and the list goes on). We just can’t keep all the plates spinning! In the end, our relational world feels wobbly and thin. At best, we have just enough bandwidth to exist in each of these different contexts. At worst, we’re frustrated, burned out and exhausted.

Intentional Owner-Making Environments will equip people over time to order their relational world in a particular pattern. We are moving into a field of study called Proxemics, which is the study of human spatial requirements and the effects that density has on behavior, communication, and social interaction.

This field sets on the foundation laid by the pioneering work of sociologist Edward Hall, encapsulated in his opus, The Hidden Dimension. Later, author Joseph Myers applied and expanded this thinking to the process of belonging in his book, The Search to Belong. Bobby Harrington and Alex Absalom in their book Discipleship that Fits, bring additional clarity.

Harrington and Absalom, building on the work of Hall and Myers, suggest that there are five different social spaces required for human flourishing and spiritual transformation. You can see the summaries in the table .

These five social contexts comprise the levels of community that forge transformed owners of the faith. Each social context has a different type of focus and each is necessary in spiritual development.
What I find most fascinating, as a follower of Jesus, is how Jesus perfectly models these five social contexts. Jesus interacts with different sized groups of people at different times, for different purposes, to different depths. Notice the circles of Jesus’ relational world. He

announced and demonstrated the presence of the Kingdom of God with the crowds through his teaching, healing, and compassion83. We see Jesus being followed by 72 followers, attending parties, weddings, and other social events. Eventually, he sent the 72

out together on mission84. Jesus also called 12 and they followed Him around daily85. Out of these 12, Jesus did have 3 that he was closest to Peter, James, and John86. Of course, at the very center of Jesus’ relational world was his Father.

Jesus said, “My Father and I are one…I can only do what I see my Father doing.”87 No relationship mattered more to Him.

That divine space with his Father was where Jesus found His identity

and destiny and shared everything. The intimate space with the 3 was there they shared deep transparency and found openness and intimacy. The 12 were His team, where there wasn’t the same depth of transparency, but private information was shared, which provided support, challenge and closeness. The 72 were his tribe, his extended family on mission. We only share snapshots of ourselves at this level, but we find a sense of affinity, shared mission, and community. The crowds included 100s or 1000’s, they shared experiences and resources with Jesus – meals and miracles, information and inspiration.

So, as a faith leader in our tradition, consider the following observations as you seek to forge community that creates owners of the faith.

WE NEED ALL FIVE SOCIAL CONTEXTS.

Every person needs all five spaces because each is conducive to nourishing a certain aspect of what it is to be transformed into a human being who is fully alive. We’ll experience the full flourishing effect of community, when each social context is a normative part of our relational world. We must decide to engage all of these social contexts as a faith community. If you consider any successful enterprise, they organize around these social spaces. For example, a football game contains all four “human” social spaces: The crowd in the stands, the entire team of 72, the “twelve” on the field, and the three coaches. Once notice this pattern, you will discovery it all around you in the marketplace, the military, in education, and in every successful human endeavor.

THE MORE WE CAN OVERLAP THE CIRCLES, THE BETTER.

The more we can overlap the circles, the more cohesive and powerful our experience of community will be. If we try to develop our personal context (4-12) in one relational network and our social context in another, we’ll quickly find our relational world stretched too thin. The more our transparent, personal and social contexts in our faith community, the more depth and meaning we will experience.

The early church continued in this pattern that Jesus modeled for them,

Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. Acts 2: 4647

WE MUST INTENTIONALLY DEVELOP DIVERSITY IN YOUR RELATIONAL WORLD.

Within the four human social contexts, Jesus had connections with people at all levels of spiritual interest, various worldviews and lifestyles. He invited everyone to come in and experience life within the Kingdom. Even within his 12, Jesus had a surprising range of people, from tax collectors to fishermen to political zealots. It was more spicy curry than plain vanilla. He invited people to belong, long before they believed the same things as him.

THE CLOSER TO THE CENTER, THE MORE IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE SHARED MISSION AND VALUES.

We find that the closer people moved toward the center circles of Jesus’ world, the more they shared an increasing alignment to His mission and values. Jesus was selective, particularly about the 12 and 3. The 12 and the 3 demonstrated shared mission and values through their willingness to drop everything and learn the way of Jesus. Like us, they were a jumble of beliefs, ideas, personal histories, and bad habits. Even so, they knowingly pointed their feet toward Jesus and intentionally followed Him in all of life. As we develop our personal and intimate relationships, issues like shared values, shared mission, confidentiality, communication, trust, and expectations become increasingly important to clarify.

In the KC Underground, this happens in a gradual process, as people move through the different experiences I described earlier and the equipping services of our Hub. We come alongside them to help them rethink and then rebuild their relational circles in one particular neighborhood or network, the one to which they have the greatest sense of mission and presence. That is the context in which they own the faith and share their faith with others.

Labor Day is party day in our neighborhood. Last year, two new neighbors, a young couple who had moved in the month before, were invited to the festivities by Lori, who lives directly across the street from them.

The party was nothing fancy, just BBQ (it’s Kansas City!), potluck, a Spotify playlist and conversation.

We lead a microchurch, made up mostly of people in our neighborhood, that live like a spiritual extended family in our neighborhood. We were hosting this party together. The young couple lingered until every other person had left. We loaded them down with a bunch of leftovers to take home.

Right before they exited our table, Mickaela took a pause and remarked, “I’ve got to say something. You know how you hear that back in the fifties everybody knew each other in their neighborhood and they acted like a big family? Well, we feel like we went in a time machine and moved into one of those neighborhoods. This party was so fun, and people really like each other. Why is this neighborhood like this? “

I explained, “Well there’s a group of us here that value our neighborhood deeply. Here’s why. When Jesus said, “Love your neighbor,’ we think he meant that we are called to love…wait for it…our actual neighbors, not just some metaphorical one. We have built the rhythms of our lives around loving each other and treating each other like family, because we believe that Jesus calls all of us to be brothers and sisters. We’ve been doing that for a few years, and it’s changed the culture of our neighborhood.”

She smiled and said, “That is cool. When is the next party?” A year later, Tyler and Mickeala have now opened their home to host a neighborhood party. They are now owners and creators of the community that has been created. At more than one of those dinners and parties, the conversations become deeply spiritual and many of them center around scripture, prayer and intentional mission. After the NFL playoff game party, as the conversation overtook the viewing of the game, Mickeala said three different times, “I want relationship with God.” Mickeala is a new owner of the faith, who is already wrapped in a community where she can be apprenticed. In fact, our microchurch is meeting tonight and guess who is leading the gathering for the first time? Mickeala.

Through intentional living, we have the different social contexts overlapping in our neighborhood, all creating a vibrant community of faith where people are taking their next steps. Through the KC Underground, we are equipping scores of others to do the same. I could tell you similar stories where these spiritual extended families are emerging in other networks and neighborhoods, from Kansas Rodeo Riders to Algerian refugees. What if every organized faith community became a platform for inspiring and equipping owners of the faith to forge this type of overlapping, interwoven, organic community?

As a faith leader, pause to consider the following Community-Forged Questions:

Do we understand and engage all five spheres of community required for human flourishing in our faith community?

How well do we help people creating overlapping social spaces that deepen their engagement in our faith community?

How well do we move people out of the privatized individualism trend into deep, meaningful faith community engagement?

If Community is one side of the container, let’s look at the other, Mission.

Chapter 11 Mission-Fixated:

Owner-Making Ingredient #4

Often, faith leaders see mission or service as an extra activity we add on to the programs of the organized church. We set up volunteer opportunities to go to the soup kitchen or do a light construction project. Perhaps, we sponsor a mission trip to a foreign locale once a year. Although intentions are good and there is an important place for these activities, this inadvertently sends the message that mission is a specialization reserved for the professionals and, of course, the occasional volunteer. This mindset disempowers millions of ordinary folks, in our faith communities from discovering that the mission of God can infuse every area of their life.

Mission reaches down to our very deepest understandings of who God is, why we are here, and how we are to live. Mission is not a tag-on. Mission is not a department. Mission isn’t something we volunteer for a few hours a month. Mission is not something reserved for the elite or the paid professionals.

Mission is the sweeping force that runs through everything we are and do. Ultimately, mission is not first about activity. Mission is first about identity: God’s identity and ours, as His offspring. Mission starts by understanding that we serve a God who is a missionary. By His very nature, our God is a sent one who left His throne on mission to redeem mankind and all of creation in Jesus.

Mission is not something outside of God. Mission is woven into His very nature. Mission is the heartbeat of God. It’s this simple: The Father sent Israel. The Father sent the Son. The Father, Son, and Spirit are sending the Church. This is the reason our God left His throne on mission. This heartbeat-mission is what drives all of redemptive history.

The New Testament describes the heart of God this way in 2 Peter 3:9, “The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.”

That’s God’s heart, “That none…should perish.” Here that phrase like a repeating heartbeat. That’s his heart for you and for every single person you will see today. At a time when human history was dominated by alienation from God, through the covenant with Abraham and later with Israel, the Father himself comes to man. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Yahweh’s covenant with Israel was this gift of His presence. I am going to come down to you… Exodus 19:9 (NIV) God sent Himself.

Leading Exodus scholar, J.I. Durham, quietly sees this gracious act of coming down as not only the most important event in Exodus, but also arguably the whole Old Testament. He proclaims, “…the Sinai narrative has been determined by a single factor…the gift of Yahweh of his presence to Israel.”

Of course, we Christians believe that Jesus is the fullest expression of the missionary presence.

The Word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighborhood.

John 1:14 (The Message)

Jesus didn’t send us an email offering us salvation. He didn’t volunteer for an hour and head back to heaven. He moved into the neighborhood. He became one of us, lived with us, loved us, served us, suffered with us, and died for us, to redeem us.

Jesus paints a seven-fold image of his mission when he quotes the prophet Isaiah,

““The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me

to proclaim good news to the poor.

He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind,

to set the oppressed free,

to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” Luke. 4:18-19 (NIV)

We are being invited to join him in that mission to bring this type of wholeness and healing to the earth. If God is a missionary God, then as an offspring, we are a missionary people. The natural habitat for a missionary is mission. Just like if you pull a starfish from its natural habitat, eventually it will begin to die, slowly harden, and at best become a souvenir. At that point the starfish is a mere token to place on the shelf as a reminder of what it once was-alive and reproducing. Outside of mission, disciples harden and become souvenirs sitting in services and small groups. At best, dim reminders of what we were meant to be, agents of mission and healing.

That leads to another reason why IOE’s must be mission-fixated: Mission provides the best environment for Owner-Making.

One of the biggest challenges President Lincoln faced early in the war was his do-nothing generals. The first year on the battlefield was marked by inactivity and frustration. The Union generals refused to directly engage Confederate troops for various reasons – not enough training, not enough resources, too many enemy combatants, the terrain was disadvantageous, and the list went on. When George McClellan took over command in 1861, he was greeted as a savior and Lincoln had high hopes. After a humiliating and costly defeat at Bull Run, McClennan seemed to understand the necessities of the new kind of war they were fighting. He trained and drilled the troops to no end, restoring the confidence of the troops in the process.88

But by the later months of 1862, Lincoln found himself once again in the same spot. McClellan would not lead the troops into battle. He was constantly preparing, but never moving the troops into the battlefield. According to him, the troops were never quite ready. He refused to engage the fight.

In the end, he wrote McClellan a letter consisting of only a single sentence:

"If you don't want to use the army, I should like to borrow it for a while. Yours respectfully, A. Lincoln."

I wonder if God feels the same way about faith communities that have people constantly training and educating, but never engaging mission. The mission is what the training is for! Mission and maturity go together when it comes to owner-making. You can’t get the one without the other. Mature soldiers start with basic training, but the real maturity is forged in the battlefield, while engaging mission.

Mature soldiers are battle-tested and battle-hardened. Shared mission in the same context provides the proximity and pressure needed to make transformed owners of the faith. That’s why we advocate so strongly for people to drill down deep and attempt to build all their social contexts in mostly one setting: live, work, learn, or play. Just to be clear, you don’t have to go somewhere else to find that context of mission. You already are in it. The mission of God isn’t first about crossing oceans, jungles and deserts; it’s first about crossing the room, crossing your fence, crossing the street, crossing the cubicle at work or perhaps, crossing the gym where you work out in the morning. You can be on mission without leaving your zip code.

Over time, through experiences like Followers Made, Leaders Made, and Missionaries Made, we accept that people are coming from different contexts. But the outcome-focus, the content-flavor, the habitsfueled, and the community forged increasingly calls them toward and equips them for mission in one context. By the time they get to the Microchurch Learning Community, they are well on their way to living on mission and then we ratchet it down hard: To whom have you been sent? What is your calling? Go all in on one context.

Mission starts where you live, work, learn, and play. Yes, it also includes crossing ethnic, socioeconomic, geographic and other cultural barriers that will take you to places you never imagined. But it starts where God has already sent you. God is already on mission in that place every day. We must turn the mission light on by awakening people from an insular lifestyle that keeps us looking at our neighbors as strangers or keeps people so caught up in the ghetto of religious programs that they have no time to live with the people God has sent them to as agents of healing.

God is constantly putting his hand on our back, pushing us out toward our neighbor, toward the hurting, toward the lost, and toward the marginalized who are among us. We ask every faith-owner to answer the question, “To whom have you been sent? What is your calling?”

Who are you called to live with, love, serve, suffer with, and even, if need be, die for? God has already placed you in a network of people or neighborhood. Just like Jesus, we are called to be one of and get involved in a deep way. From involvement, we move to identification. Who does Jesus identify with in the following passage?

“Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’” Matthew 25:34-36

Jesus has identified so completely with the hungry and thirsty in the hood, that when we help them, he says we are doing that for Him. We are to identify with the people we are sent to. No matter what people group God is sending us to, when we go out on mission, we’ll find He already out there, on mission, helping his family, serving, living as “one of.” That’s where He expects to see us.

Joining God in his mission to redeem means continually asking this question, “To whom have I been sent?”

That’s where simple training tools like the Breath and BLESS rhythms described earlier, empower ordinary people to do simple things consistently with neighborly intentionality. Those small interventions inside of a laser focus on one particular community over time equal a big impact. Our role

as faith leaders is to help people discover their areas of passion and calling, then equip them to engage that part of God’s mission.

As a faith leader, here are some questions for you to pause and consider:

How well do help each person discover that the mission of faith involves the everyday spaces where we live, work, learn and play?

How well do help each person own the issues of mission personally?

What resources, process, and tools do we provide to empower each person to own, apply, and innovate within the mission of faith?

Chapter 12 Content-Flavored:

Owner-Making Ingredient #5

In the Western religious experience, content and doctrine is king. Much of what is labeled discipleship, confirmation, or training in the church is curriculum codependent. The emphasis on transferring content, with little concern for whether or not people are actually transformed.

While content is a crucial element of any transformation process, it cannot be the primary focus. That’s one of the reasons we are covering this as the last ingredient. Without an outcome-focus on Spiritempowered transformation, without habits to fuel those outcomes, without the proper community to forge these outcomes and habits, and without the context of mission and risk, religious experience simply degrades down to a data dump of doctrine.

As church leaders, we know what it’s like to slave over sermons, small group curriculum, classes and the like, earnestly believing, “If we can just get the right content into people, they will change.” I’ve been there, thinking, “This weekend series is going to be a game changer…. this 40-day church campaign is going to be gamechanger…ad nauseum.”

This is simply not true.

The most content focused, theologically trained people in Jesus’ day were in fact his worst enemies. Many of the cruelest, most-bigoted, and destructive people are those who are religious zealots, sold completely on the supremacy of their religious belief.

What role, then, does content play?

As an example, consider this statement of Jesus; “You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.” Jesus is placing an exceptionally high value on the truth, but the truth is a means to an end... not the end itself. The end, or the purpose of truth is freedom.

As the outcome of Love (mercy, compassion, kindness, joy, peace) remains the focus of your ownermaking efforts, fueled by habits forged in community within the context of mission, you will see more genuine freedom in people, not simply an accumulation of religious knowledge.

That doesn’t mean content does not matter. Quite the opposite, the right content absolutely must flavor all IOE’s. The key is to discover and define your “faith fractal.”

A fractal is the simplest possible repeating pattern in any system. You might also call this your DNA, or the minimum arrangement of core elements necessary to consider “whatever you are” to be “you.”

In nature, fractals are ubiquitous. Many flowers, fruits and vegetables grow by fractal patterns. Take a close look at a pineapple! Every snowflake and ice crystal are a repeating fractal. Fractals also show up in the veins in your body and river deltas. Mother Nature has been called a “hell of a good designer,” and fractals are the design principles she follows to put her most beautiful work together. 89

A fractal design is a very simple, repeating pattern.

If we hold tightly to a very small set of core or fractal values and beliefs, we do not have to intensively manage the complicated manifestations or extensions of the entire faith system. All great Starfish movements have the capability to boil down their ideology into a fractal, an irreducible minimum that is easy to reproduce.

What is the irreducible minimum of your faith tradition?

In The Starfish and The Spider, Ori notes the following, “Ideology is the glue that holds decentralized organizations together90.”

Consider the following examples, “the Apaches held the common belief that they belonged on the land and deserved to be self-governing…Without that ideology, the Apaches wouldn’t have had the motivation to remain decentralized,” while resisting the Spaniards, Mexicans and Americans. 91 In fact, the destruction of the Apache movement began when a few Apaches walked away from this ideology by accepting the invitation to become farmers, thus domesticating themselves into oppression. Or, in our time, consider the Twelve-step ideology of AA that has helped free countless people from addictions.

Without any hierarchy and without bosses, AA has spawned thousands of “mutual aid fellowships of men and woman” from all walks of life, whose bond is the shared belief and shared work of the Twelve Traditions92. Any variation from these beliefs is considered the first step back into addiction. The bar is high, you start with 90 meetings in 90 days. Why? The ideology must be set deep in the mind and lifestyle for freedom to become a reality in one life and then spread virally to another.

We don’t have to look very long or very deep to discover these fractals in our faith traditions.

For example, in my tradition, we have unbelievably complex theological frameworks that have developed over 2000 years, since the time of Christ, resulting in tens of thousands of denominations

within Christianity. More than 33,000 according to the World Christian Encyclopedia (Barrett, Kurian, and Johnson; Oxford University Press)!

Yet, if we return to teaching of our founder, we find him simplifying things profoundly. Jesus was able to boil down the entire Law and the Prophets to two things: Love God and Love your neighbor as yourself.

Furthermore, even the way Jesus organized his teaching, he did it all through one, count it, one predominant theme. What is the fractal Jesus taught?

After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!” Mark 1:14-15 (NIV)

Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. Matthew 4:23 (NIV)

Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. Matthew 9:35 (NIV)

After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him… Luke 8:1 (NIV)

When Jesus had called the Twelve together…He sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God…

Mark 9:1-2 (NIV)

The Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go… “When you enter a town,” he said, “…tell them the kingdom of God is near you.” Luke 10: 1, 5-9 (NIV)

Throughout His life, Jesus had one center for all of His teaching.

Jesus repeatedly links the phrase “Good News” with the Kingdom of God. When you read the 100 plus passages where Jesus refers to the Kingdom of God, you will perceive quickly that the Kingdom of God is not just another topic for Jesus. It is not merely a volume of one possible topic on His proverbial bookshelf, somewhere between Forgiveness and Money. The Kingdom of God is the bookshelf that holds all the other volumes. The Kingdom of God is Jesus’ paradigm or fractal. It is His framework. All other topics are simply descriptions of how to live and operate inside the Kingdom of God within that specific area.

After rising from the dead, Jesus had 40 short days with His followers. It would do to pause and ask yourself, “If I had one month to live, what would I want to communicate to the people that I love?” Bets are that it would be the irreducible minimum of all that you held to be sacred and immutable. If you want to know what Jesus’ irreducible core is, look at this passage.

He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the Kingdom of God.

Acts 1:3 (NIV)

Indeed, this was the message the early church carried to the world. The last glimpse we have of the early church in the last verse in the last chapter of the book of Acts says it all. Paul is under house arrest in Rome. The summation of the apostle’s life and ministry reads simply:

For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him. Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ. Acts 28:30-31 (NIV)

For Paul and the early followers of Jesus, it came down to two things: the proclamation “Jesus is Lord” and the proclamation of the Kingdom of God, which are essential the same message. When we stop breathing someday, may the people who knew me say, “That person never stopped talking about Jesus and they never stopped talking about the Kingdom of God.”

Paul goes on to describe the fractal in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, “Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.”

Every follower of Jesus must ask, “How does the Gospel inform all of life?”

Jesus and the Good News of the Kingdom are, and always will be, the fractal of the Christian faith. As His disciples, we trust completely in His finished work on the cross. Salvation is a gift of grace, by faith. We embrace a three-world-worldview: Jesus is Lord. He is the Master of the Art of Living. He is right…about absolutely everything. Our lifelong journey is to move from unbelief to belief in Jesus in every area of life.

Of course, the historic creeds, like the Apostles Creed, also function in this same way: a fractal of the faith built on 12 doctrines.

The Apostles’ Creed

I believe in God, the Father Almighty,

Creator of heaven and earth; (The 1st article Mt 5 :45, Gen 1:1; Rom 1:20) And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; (The 2nd Mt 3:17; Phil 2:12) Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,

Born of the Virgin Mary, (The 3rd Lk 1:35; Lk 2:7) Suffered under Pontius Pilate,

Was crucified, died, and was buried. (The 4th Jn 19:19, 29 – 42) He descended into hell;

The third day he rose again from the dead; (The 5th 1 Pet 3:19 – 20; ) He ascended into Heaven,

And is seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; (The 6th Mt 28:1-10; Jn 20:11-18; Lk 24:51; Heb 1:3; Mk 14:36)

From thence he shall come to judge the living and the dead. (The 7thMt 16: 27; Acts 10:39; 1 Cor 15: 51)

I believe in the Holy Spirit, (The 8thJn 14:15 – 20; Acts 1:7 – 8) The Holy Catholic Church,

The Communion of Saints, (The 9th Mt 16:18 – 19; Eph 5:26-27; Col 1:24; Mt 28:19 – 20; 2 Cor

11:13; 1 Cor 15: 33)

The forgiveness of sins, (The 10thJn 20:22 – 23)

The resurrection of the body, (The 11th 1Cor 15:51 – 54; 1 Thes 4:13 – 18) And life everlasting. Amen. (The 12th 1 Jn 5:20)

In Hebrew tradition, many would consider the Shema to be the starting point of its faith fractal. It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this most basic confession of Israel’s faith. The Shema was the centerpiece of the morning and evening prayer of God’s people. The Shema encapsulates the Oneness and Presence of God, along with an invitation to a loving relationship, “Listen, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone, and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your being, and all your might.” -Deut. 6:4-5

If you flow in this beautiful tradition, you must ask, “How does the Shema inform all of life?”

In the opening speeches of Deuteronomy, the words “listen” and “love” are inextricably woven together. The invitation, “Listen, O Israel” isn’t about the propagation of sound or the ear drum’s capacity to receive it. Rather, “listen” is a deeper invitation to let this faith fractal saturate one’s entire life, to let it sink in, and then activate change. In other words, in the Hebrew, hearing and doing are also inextricably woven together. What is the response being called for? Love your God will all your heart, all your being, and all your might. Love, within the context of the Hebrew scriptures, is not primarily a warm fuzzy feeling. Love is about action, loyalty, and faithfulness.

This is. not an invitation to add another box to your life labeled “religion” that you place alongside all the other boxes in your life labeled work, family, recreation, finances, friendships, etc.

Many people are exhausted with religion for this very reason. If we see our faith as a compartmentalized box we are adding to our life, it becomes a burden instead of an engine of transformation and energy source at the center of being.

For most of us, life already feels like a juggling act to keep all the boxes up and running. Guess what? The overall box of life never increases in size. We’ve still only got 24 hours in a day. The idea of “squeezing in” another box will only make life busier and more complex. The problem is, too often, this is actually what most faith communities are offering the Unengaged Middle, “Please add some ‘religious activity’ to your life.”

The Shema, for the Jew, and the Gospel, for the Christian, provide us a new operating system, a whole new framework for every area of life. We let our faith fractal provide a new center for all of life. In this way, every area of life relates to our faith fractal rather than compete with it.

The goal of the content-flavored ingredient of an IOE is to first clearly define our faith fractal in a simple and reproducible way. We must find creative ways to share this with those we influence, helping them to own that faith fractal by allowing it to flavor every area of their life. The goal is not intellectual assent, but integration into all of life. The faith fractal must flavor our deepest level of convictions; those that energize our worldview, choices, and actions.

According to Catholic Philosopher Michael Novak, there are three levels of convictions or beliefs: Public, Private, and Core Convictions. John Ortberg picks up on these in his book, Faith and Doubt93.

Public Convictions. These are the beliefs we want others to think we hold, even though we may not believe them ourselves. For example, we may want people to believe we are well read in the Scriptures, even though we only read the Bible occasionally. A Biblical example would be King Herod. He said to the Magi, “Go find the Christ child. As soon as you find him, come and let me know, so I may go worship him, as well (Matthew 2:7-8).” Was that Herod’s true purpose? It may be hard to believe, but politicians in the ancient world would say anything to curry public favor. We all practice this Herod-like behavior on occasion.

Private Convictions. These are things that I sincerely think I believe, but it turns out I actually don’t believe them at the deepest level of my being. Like Peter proclaiming to Jesus that he would never deny him, “Even if everyone else falls away, I will not! (Mark 14:29-31).” In that moment, he was sincere and convinced he believed it, but he soon found out that his belief was fickle. He denied Christ three times that very night.

Core Convictions. You could call this the “Mental Map.” Every one of us has “mental maps” about the way we think things really are and the way life really works. We will always live out those beliefs. Our core beliefs are revealed by our behavior.

The goal is to see our core convictions completely flavored by our faith fractal. We can be amazingly self-deluded on what we actually believe, truly thinking our private religious convictions are running the show, when we have core convictions that are actually pagan.

The writers of Scripture have a word for this that we don’t use much in our day: depravity. This is why, in Romans 1:21,28, Paul writes about our gunked up mental maps this way, “Although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened…Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind.”

For a short period, we may be able to stave off the behavioral outcome of a misplaced core conviction through will power, but eventually, we will snap back to the old behavior that is in alignment with our incorrect core conviction. To change your mental map, you have to learn the faith fractal, but that’s just step one. Secondly, you have to act your way into this new way of thinking through regular habits and risky obedience, which leads us to our next ingredient of an IOE.

As a faith leader, before we proceed, please pause and consider these questions:

Do we have clarity on what the fractal of our faith is? What is our irreducible minimum?

How well do we pass on this fractal of faith in way that is generous and inclusive?

Is this passed on in way that moves beyond intellectual assent to integration into all of life?
Along the way, we’ve asked you to reflect on some questions. An IOE contains the five essential ingredients to create transformative and multiplicative ownership:

THE OWNER-MAKING INGREDIENT STARFISH
As a leader of a faith community or organization, we challenge you to get a journal, work slowly back through the questions in each section, take notes, jot down ideas, and run your owner-making, leadership development, and team building experiences, tools, and resources through these five filters. Are you creating intentional owner-making environments? Which of these five ingredients are in the mix? Which are missing? How can you put the missing ingredients into the recipe?

Recently, one of my daughters decided on a whim to whip up some cookies. She was almost done when she realized that we didn’t have enough baking soda. Unphased, she threw what little we had in the mix and went straight ahead. Did we get cookies? Indeed. Did the cookies get eaten? A few.

That missing ingredient makes a big difference.

With it, the cookies rise, and the texture is wonderful. Without it, not so much. Expect the same results when it comes to IDE’s. Without all the ingredients, you’ll find things falling flat. Add all the ingredients and watch people rise to new levels of transformation and impact.

Chapter 13

The Owner-Making Ecosystem Starfish
“A business ecosystem is just like the natural ecosystem; first, needs to be understood, then, needs to be well planned, and also needs to be

thoughtfully renewed as well.”

― Pearl Zhu, Digital Maturity

Sow with a view to righteousness, Reap in accordance with kindness; Break up your fallow ground,

For it is time to seek the Lord.

Hosea 10:12

Starfish can only survive and thrive in the right ecosystem.

You won’t find Starfish nestled in the mountaintop crags of Mt McKinley. If you find a starfish buried in the sands of the Mojave Desert, someone must have dropped it! It certainly didn’t crawl there.

As you can imagine, Starfish inhabit the oceans of the world. Although you can find starfish on the deep-sea floor down to 20,000ft, the greatest number and diversity of the species occurs in coastal areas and tidal pools, what is considered a shallow ocean ecosystem. They are considered the most important predator in that ecosystem. They are categorized as a “keystone species.” This is a species, which if it is negatively affected, will have a “disproportionately greater effect on the whole ecosystem because they are the key component.”94

Reproducing owners of the faith – disciples – are a keystone species. We need them to thrive and reproduce, so the shalom of God can fill homes, neighborhoods, cities, states, nations, and eventually the whole earth, until the “earth will be filled knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea (Hab 2:14).”

Starfish only survive and thrive in the right ecosystem.

Ecosystems are communities of interacting organisms living together in combination with their physical environment. The earth is filled with ecosystems like forests, grasslands, deserts, tundra, wetlands, prairies, rainforest, and mountains. Each filled with plants, animals, and microorganisms in their natural environment. When ecosystems are healthy, there is balance of energy and relationships that sustain and reproduce life in all its various forms.

When wolves were reintroduced to their natural ecosystem in the world-famous Yellowstone Park in 1995, after being eradicated in the 1920’s, the returning wolves dramatically changed the park’s rivers, forests and even the very landscape itself. They were brought in to manage the rising elk population, which were overgrazing. But scientists were shocked at the far-reaching ripple of direct and indirect consequences throughout the entire ecosystem. Everything from surging beaver populations to a massive recovery of willow tree stands by a factor of ten; from unbrowsed plants increasing by 84 percent to the number of songbirds swelling, who find their habitat in those willow trees and plants.

Beavers build dams, which changed the course of rivers, creating new ponds and lakes, and the list goes on. One can’t help but recall the scene in the The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe where the curse is broken and Narnia springs forth with new life!

Doug Smith, a wildlife biologist in charge of the Yellowstone Wolf project, describes it this way, “It is like kicking a pebble down a mountain slope where conditions were just right that a falling pebble could trigger an avalanche of change.”95

Now, consider that your faith community or organization has its own natural ecosystem. In a more general use, an ecosystem is any complex, interconnected system.

As demonstrated, small changes can yield dramatic change.

How can we make small strategic changes in our ecosystem, so it will become verdant for the flourishing of reproducing owners of the faith, which will then unleash a ripple effect of an avalanche of shalom downhill?

This is where the Owner-Making Ecosystem Starfish comes in.

This Starfish provides a framework of five questions that pertain to essential dynamics or elements in a disciple-making ecosystem. I (Rob) was first introduced to these questions by my friends and partners, Doug Paul and Dave Rhoades, each of whom have led significant disciple-making movements, which I don’t say lightly. They’ve seen four generations or more on multiple strands, culminating into thousands of disciple-making disciples. We’ve worked together leading various learning communities and coaching initiatives, over the years, where these concerns and questions were central. My conversations with them have shaped my thinking and practice profoundly.

THE OWNER-MAKING ECOSYSTEM STARFISH
In this chapter, we will first define each question. Please consider carefully your answers or lack of them. Each of these questions, will trigger other questions in your mind. That’s good. Keep a journal handy. Jot down answers and questions. Use these as a guide for conversation with your team.

Once the question has been framed, I will provide examples of how we are answering that question in the Kansas City Underground. These are not “the right” answers per se. They are our right answers for our context. I believe there are actually hundreds of right answers to these questions, as each faith community must contextualize the ideas and practices for their setting. Please know, our answers to these questions are evolving and always open to reformation!

In the words of Reformers, “Semper Reformada.” In other words, “Always reforming.”

May we be reformed by the Word and the Spirit, returning to our deepest roots, while simultaneously reinterpreting them for our time and space, our people and place.

Owner-Making Ecosystem Question #1: The Vision Question What is your definition of a disciple?

Again, we return to the idea, begin with the end in mind.

Imagine you’ve been invited by the CEO of Wiggits International to visit their premier factory. You’re amazed by the sheer amount of activity in the factory, people buzzing back and forth, like bees in a beehive. As of yet, you have not seen, used or purchased a Wiggit, although you have heard of their fame. After a welcome from the CEO and his staff, along with a general look around, you excitedly ask the CEO, “May I see a Wiggit? I have heard so much about them but have yet to experience one firsthand.”

The CEO says, “Walk with me!” as you enter the vast factory floor. He pontificates on the necessity and importance of the Wiggit in the American economy, as you enter the belly of the beast. You can barely keep up with his gesticulations and articulations, as you tour the various departments, where teams are busily at work, creating a plethora of products and programs. Hours later, in exhaustion, you are back at the front door. The CEO suddenly dismisses you explaining, “The work of Wiggits is never done! I must run!” As you walk back to the parking lot, you eventually realize, “I still don’t know what a Wiggit is!”

Excuse the crass analogy, but I think you can see where this going. Disciple-making “factories” should know what a disciple actually is, with clarity and specificity. Our churches are filled with activities and programs that can all be generically labeled as “discipleship.” But when everything is labeled as discipleship, then there’s a chance nothing is discipleship.

If your faith community’s ultimate purpose is to produce disciples as that is the primary mission Jesus gave us in Matthew 28:18, “Go make disciples,” then maybe we need to know what a disciple actually is.

Over the years, I have interacted with hundreds of church leaders on this very question. Typically, the answers fall into one of two categories.

The first is stunned silence, which turns into some stammering of religious catchphrases. From there, they pick up steam and start outlining all the various programs and departments of the church. Most of

the folks in that category have never been asked that question so directly. It’s very discombobulating. One is left thinking, “You’ve got some great programs, groups, and people. A lot of activity, for sure, but I still don’t know what you think a disciple actually is.”

The second is theological pontificating. These leaders will wind up, like a major league pitcher, and unleash a treatise. Often, they offer to share an immersive white paper on the topic, that was the outcome of their dissertation or the summary findings of a multi-year committee they commissioned for this express purpose. Sincerely, I am impressed by their work and depth of insight. But the response is so complex and nuanced that I couldn’t reproduce even a fraction of it five minutes later. One is still left wondering, “What exactly is their definition of a disciple?”

Words matter. Definitions matter. We can’t measure success in disciple-making, if we don’t know what our definition of one is.

Let me invite you to consider these qualifiers as you work on your definition or refine it.

Is it Biblical? Is it firmly grounded in deep Biblical convictions that have been tested over time and confirmed by the testimony of the Church Universal? What are your core theological convictions about disciple-making?

Is it robust? If someone lived into this definition, would they actually look like the disciples we see in the New Testament, who turned the world upside down? What are the irreducible minimums that have to be included for it to robust?

Is it simple? Could you share it with a young teenager and have them understand it?

Is it reproducible? Could the average person easily remember it and share it with others?

Is it compelling? Does it make your heart beat fast when you share it with others? Does it remain compelling for people at various stages of spiritual maturity, beginners and sages alike? Does it remain compelling over a lifetime?

The first two questions ensure you are on firm foundation. The third and fourth question allow your definition to scale, so it can used by a movement. The last question win’s people’s hearts and minds, yielding higher levels of participation and motivation.

The KC Underground Example

Our definition for a disciple is double-click.

Click One: Character X Calling = Impact.

If you ask disciple-makers in our movement, what it means to be a disciple, they will tell you, “Character x Calling = Impact!” You’ve already read what this means back in Chapter 4. But, let’s unpack it through these qualifiers.

We feel this definition is simple, reproducible and compelling. You can share it three words! However, we also train our people to share this compelling invitation in a few minutes. Something like this,

Ever feel like you’re not living, just existing? Jesus said, “I have come that you might have life and have it to the full (John 10:10)! Jesus is inviting us to live the fully alive life. In other words, Jesus is the Master at the Art of Living. As the Author of Life, He can be our teacher to show us how to come alive in every area of life. If you accept Jesus as your teacher, there are two big areas in which you will experience transformation, Character and Calling. Character is becoming like Jesus: More love, more joy, more

peace, more patience, more kindness, more goodness, more gentleness, and more self-control. Imagine that gap between who you are and who you want to be closing. Imagine how the quality of your relationships will go up. Calling is about making the unique, one-of-a-kind contribution that Goddesigned you for. As you grow in Character, what the Bible calls Fruit of the Spirit, and Calling, what the Bible calls Gifts of the Spirit, it has a multiplying effect. Impact increases both in you and through you! That’s the transformation Jesus wants all of us to experience. Character x Calling = Impact.

Click Two: One Sentence Definition

A person who is apprenticed to Jesus in the fully alive life, experiencing habit-fueled, on-going transformation in character and calling, while moving deeper into community and multiplying disciples.

This is a “behind the scenes” expanded version that we equip leaders to know. We believe this is both a Biblical and robust definition of a disciple. Since we’ve already been through our Owner-Making Environment Starfish, you’ve been down the rabbit hole with us, and know our five tectonic-level theological convictions that undergird our definition of a disciple. A disciple is…

Focused on the Spirit’s Outcomes.

Fueled by Spiritual Habits that Jesus embodied.

Forged by Community that Jesus modeled.

Fixated on the Mission of Jesus.

Flavored by the Gospel of Jesus.

These theological convictions shape everything: our message, mediums and methods. You may or may not agree with ours. You may or may not even like ours! That’s ok. We offer it only as an example.

Based on what you just read thus far, your lifelong theological reflections, and your personal embodiment of the life of Jesus, we urge you to consider the Vision question through the lens of the five questions we’ve offered. Begin the process of crafting or refining your definition of disciple.

Owner-Making Ecosystem Question #2: The Voice Question Who listens to you and is ready to respond?

Start right, stay right.

In 1979, Air New Zealand Flight 901, with 257 people on board, left Auckland, for a sightseeing flight to Antarctica and back. What the pilots did not know, however, someone had modified the flight coordinates by a mere two degrees the night before. Extrapolated over their flight time, that error took them 28 miles east of where the pilots assumed, they would be.

Two degrees off in the beginning, led to a 28-mile miss.

As they approached Antarctica, the pilots descended to a lower altitude to give the passengers a better look at the scenery. Because of cloud cover, they had no way of knowing that the incorrect coordinates had placed them directly in the path of Mount Erebus, an active volcano that rises from the frozen landscape to a height of more than 12,000 feet. By the time the instruments sounded the warning that

the ground was rising fast toward them, it was too late. The airplane crashed into the side of the volcano, killing everyone on board. It remains the deadliest accident in the history of Air New Zealand. 96

The trajectory at the beginning of the journey sets the course for the final destination. How people are invited into the discipleship journey matters profoundly.

In many cases, the invitation to disciple-making is a “cattle call” from the platform to join a group or program. Or if we are more selective, we look only for the most competent people in the marketplace who “attend” our church. We target those whom we think have the most potential by the standards of our culture. For example, success in the marketplace is often considered an unwritten, non-negotiable for selection for most elder boards. When we do ask, we want to ease people in by offering seekerfriendly easy access. Over the years, as Brian Phipps and I have shared our IDE’s with church leaders, some of which are a 10or 12-month commitments, we’ve been surprised by how many pastors first response is, “I could never get my people to commit to something like that. Maybe six weeks tops.”

This all feels more than two degrees off from Jesus’s answer to the Voice question. How, in fact, did Jesus use his voice to invite others and who did He invite?

Jesus Criteria for Devotion

Mike Breen in his book Building a Disciple-Making Culture describes what he calls a High Challenge/High Invitation of Jesus.

High Invitation: Invitation has to do with a strong sense of grace, of being warmly welcomed and included, not for what you do but for you are. A sense of “I belong” and that the one who invites you is so very glad to be with you. We can feel this type of invitation in are bodies, it slows our breathing and a sense of rest comes over us.

High Challenge: Challenge has to do with being needed, having a valued contribution, and a willingness to do hard things at great cost. Like William Wallace famous challenge in Braveheart, “‘Fight and you may die. Run and you will live at least awhile. And dying in your bed many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here as young men and tell our enemies that they may take our lives but they will never take our freedom!’ The Challenge rouses us from our slumber or trepidation, to take up arms, and run to the battle.

Sure, Jesus’ friendship with Peter began with “Come and see, (John 1:39)” which is only invitational. But after a time of exploration, there was a clear starting line for intentional development to begin. At that point, Jesus’ voice was clearly both High Invitation and High Challenge. He was simultaneously incredibly invitational yet profoundly challenging. For example, consider Jesus’ second invitation to Peter, “Come follow me…” (Invitation, Matthew 4:19a)” …and I will make you fishers of men (Challenge, Matthew 4:19b).”

Any coach will tell you, without a sense of challenge players won’t work hard on skills or try their best. The challenge is what makes training and winning matter. Without a sense of invitation, players won’t put themselves out there, feeling safe enough take a risk, or willing to “take one for the team” verses being the glory hog. Both invitation and challenge are needed for the individuals to become a team, a

96 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Erebus_disaster

family on mission. These are the essential elements in every great sports movie, from Remember the Titans to Hoosiers.

It’s also the playbook of coach Jesus.

Jesus Criteria for Selection

Readiness: Who listens to my voice and is ready to respond? Who is hungry? Who is responsive? Who is teachable? Who is willing to make themselves available? Who is willing to invest in others like I invest in them? (Luke 9:57-62)

Revelation: Who has the Father given to me? Jesus spent extensive time in intentional prayer asking the Father to put a lightbulb over the heads of those He was to invite (Luke 6:12).

Jesus Criteria for Invitation

Personal: Jesus called them personally by name. No “cattle calls” or “sign up lists.” (Luke 6:13)

Limited: Jesus only invited twelve disciples, with an inner core of three, whom he would invite to help Him lead the twelve. (Luke 6:14-16; Mark 5:37; Matthew 17:1; Luke 8:51)

KC Underground Example

When it comes to inviting people into one of our IDEs like Followers Made, a six-month journey to become a disciple who can make disciples, we train the potential leader to begin a season of prayer like Jesus did. Think of those that you have said, “Come and see,” to. Who are the people who listen to your voice and respond? You see they are hungry and responsive. Again, Followers Made recommended grouping is twelve with four triads within. Ask the Lord to show you your twelve.

Brian Phipps, by the Spirit’s inspiration, came up with the following prayer request, “Lord, I’m slow, so please put a lightbulb over the right people’s heads.” Boy, do we have some amazing lightbulb stories! Divine appointments that would give you the chills.

Then, we invite the “lightbulb people” to read a book that pertains to the particular IDE we are inviting them to. For Followers Made, the book is Not A Fan by Kyle Idleman. We let them know, “I’m asking you to pray about going on a six-month journey with me. We will do life together at a different level, sharing our joys and burdens. We will do some hard things together. We will be different at the end of the journey. At that point, you’ll be ready to help others make the same journey. Read that book. In two weeks, I’m getting a group of around 12 people together, who are also reading the book. We will discuss what the Lord is teaching us and look at the commitments of this journey.”

Then the leader checks in on them. If they haven’t finished reading the book, they politely let the person know, “We can get together another time if and when you finish the book.”

At the meeting, which is only for those who have finished the book, the book is discussed. The commitments of daily engagement in spiritual habits, missionary formation, calling discovery and so forth are listed out in writing. You know exactly what you are committing to. This meeting is now known as the Information Huddle. At the end, the potential disciples are asked, “Is Jesus calling you to go on this journey? That’s what you need to know. If so, sign that commitment. If you’re not sure, take one more week to pray.” Most people sign up that night. Our dropout rate on Followers Made is less than %5 and our reproduction rate is 30%. 30% of those who go through go one to make disciples.

Start right, stay right. Again, this is not the only right way, just our best efforts to honor the devotion, selection, and invitation criteria of our King Jesus.

Consider the following questions about the Voice Question:

Devotion: What level of commitment do you ask of those you are inviting to the intentional disciplemaking journey? Is it both High Invitational and High Challenge?

Selection: What criteria do you use to select those you develop as disciples? Does it align with Jesus? He wasn’t looking for the “best and brightest.” He was looking for the hungry, humble, and those willing to hustle. Who is the Holy Spirt revealing to you?

Invitation: How many people do you invest in at a time and how do you invite them? Jesus had twelve with an inner circle of three. Do you have twelve with a triad within it? Surely, we must agree that we cannot improve of the methods of Jesus. Therefore, who are your twelve? Who are your three? Have you personally invited them to the journey?

Owner-Making Ecosystem Question #3: The Vocabulary Question What language and tools will you use?

Language is critical because it brings order of chaos. The power of language actually begins in the very first chapter of the Bible, in Genesis 1. From the beginning, we see words have tremendous power.

When God speaks, he's not just conveying information, but creating new realities. There is a particular pattern to God’s word, noted by scholar Pete Enns97.

On Day One, God “creates a space” for the sun, moon, and stars by separating the light from the dark. H e doesn’t create the sun, moon, and stars (the things that actually give us light) until Day Four.

What He "forms" on Day One, He fills with sun, moon, and stars on Day Four. This pattern continues thr ough the Creation Story. It is the way our Father works words.

First His words form and then they fill.

The night and the day he fills with the sun and the moon. The sky he forms, he fills with birds. That's Day Five. The sea and the land he forms, he fills with living creatures. That's Day Six.

When God speaks His words, first He forms and then He fills. Through His words, Jesus turned the chaos into a cosmos. Furthermore, as co-creators, ask any anthropologist, language creates culture. In any area of expertise or apprenticeship, there is a vocabulary one must learn to ply that trade.

Tools then amplify and enhance our ability to further create and realize what our words describe. Entire ages of human civilization have defined by the available tools: stone, bronze, and iron, which emphasize the profound importance tools play in the advancement of any human endeavor. Better tools yield new possibilities.

Of course, in any given trade, the tools and language must be carefully selected and complimentary for the given project at hand. The teacher must help the student know what the terms mean and how the tools work.

Grant me grace to return to my ineptness with mechanics. I’m the guy in the garage who ask, “What’s that thing-a-ma-bobby?” And when a friend with know-how asks, “Can you hand me the 3/8” ratchet with av24mm socket?” I’m going to need to pull out my phone and hit up google to know what he’s talking about. But, if I spend a summer working on the car with him, I’ll know what he means and even be able to make the repair myself.

In the trade of disciple-making, the right language and tools are essential, as well. If we spend time with someone who’s further down the road in their apprenticeship, anyone can learn this trade and move forward. As a disciple-maker, Jesus’ language and tools are still ours to use today. He is still taking apprentices!

Jesus’ Language

In terms of language, Jesus was the master at turning a phrase and seeding language with meaning that worked on people souls like a slow release pill. Ponder Jesus lengthy list of “mic-drop” statements that still burn themselves into our minds, some two thousand years later. To demonstrate, let’s consider just a handful of examples. I bet you can finish everyone one of these.

‘I have come that you might have and have it to the ! (John 10:10) “I have come not to be , but to .” (Matthew 20:28)

“Repent and !” (Mark 1:15)

“Love your and pray for those who curse you.” (Matthew 5:44)

But many who are first will be last, and many who are . (Matthew 19:20)

For whoever wants to save their life will , but whoever loses their life for me will . (Luke 9:24)

Let him who is without sin throw the first . (John 8:7)

Jesus worked with words like an artist works with paints. His words of art are breath-taking and beautiful beyond compare.

Jesus’ Tools

Jesus also had tools he used. Although he was a carpenter by trade, his disciple-making toolkit is far more impressive than whatever he had in his workshop in Nazareth. What were some of Jesus disciplemaking tools? Again, this is not an exhaustive list, as every dimension of Jesus life is an example to us. For our purposes, we can consider at three categories of tools Jesus used.

Practices: in Chapter 5, we explored more than a dozen practices Jesus embodied like Scripture Engagement, Various forms of Prayer, Fasting, Sabbath Rhythms, a particular way of ordering his relational world , Gospel Proclamation in Stories and Messages, Gospel Demonstration in Signs and Service, Intentionality with Meals/Parties, and the list goes on.

Parables: Each parable is first a picture that you look at and are captivated with. Then, it becomes a mirror that you can see yourself in. Finally, it becomes a window that you look through to frame your world with new meaning.

Procedures: Jesus had established training procedures, which organized the way he used his tools. These procedures were a series of osculating actions that he repeatedly used personally and with his disciples. For example, one procedure was the that of engagement, then retreat. After intensive times of engagement in mission, He would retreat to solitude alone or with his disciples for refreshment and renewal. We ignore this procedure to the peril of our own souls. Another procedure Jesus conducted was action, then reflection. He would thrust his disciples in mission to the very cliffs of poverty, sickness, and need, involving them in miracles and service among the marginalized. Then, he would invite them to reflection in conversation, leading to both correction and celebration. Another procedure Jesus conducted was teaching, then debrief. After a public teaching, he would gather with his disciples for debrief, where he would often discover they didn’t have a clue or totally missed the point! Overall, each of these procedures are various expressions of the same meta-procedure that is the synthesis of contemplation and action, which Jesus saw as essential.

KC Underground Example of Language

Of course, we seek to make our first language that of the Scriptures. Yet, each faith community also has its own dialect. A dialect is a particular form of a language which is peculiar to a specific social group.

Our faith communities have their own dialect, for good or for ill. Either our language helps us make disciples or hinders us.

I’ve been in many church buildings that have the words “Worship Center” above the doors of the auditorium. I know this may appear harmless, but the implicit message is, “This is center of our worship.” Does our worship really center in this building a few hours a week? Roman 12 invites us to return our entire lives as worship, all day, every day.

In the opening weeks of the Covid-19 Pandemic, as thousands of churches moved their Sunday services online, my Facebook feed was flooded with invitations from these congregations with advertisements that cheerfully proclaimed, “You can still go to church online!” Really? How do you go to something you are? Church is not an activity, but an identity. It easy to say, “Oh come one. Aren’t you being a little overzealous? Are we supposed to audit our language?” Our language creates a culture. The celebrated repetition of the phrase “Go to Church,” is actually affirming a radically reduced ecclesiology.

Recently, we put together, the first draft of our lexicon, the phrases and language we use repeatedly to reinforce what we hope will be a robust disciple-making ecosystem. This isn’t an exhaustive list, just some examples.

The way of Jesus is our way.

We exist to fill our city with the beauty, justice and Good News of Jesus Church is an extended spiritual family.

A missionary on every street and a microchurch in every neighborhood or network of relationships.

Character X Calling = Impact

God is Great, so we don’t have to be in control. God is Glorious, so we don’t have to be afraid. God is Good, so we don’t have to look elsewhere. God is Gracious, so we don’t have to earn it.

KC Underground Example of Tools

Our tools are organized on a continuum from informal to formal.

The informal tools are those we use in the harvest, to help others move toward Jesus and His Church. These include the Breath and BLESS rhythms described in Chapter Five. As a person lives faithfully into those missionary rhythms among the same network of people, they begin to have meaningful, and then spiritual conversations. At that point, we begin to share the Story of how Jesus has changed us and how the Gospel changes everything. Then, that missionary will invite that spiritually curious person to join them in a Discovery Bible Study (DBS).

Discovery Bible Studies are simple and reproducible groups that consist of spiritually interested people who read a Bible passage together, discovery what is says through a set of simple, open-ended questions that focus on the character of God and the invitation to obey Him. The members are encouraged to immediately experiment with living out what they have learned and to share with someone else what they have discovered. It’s a simple way for them to discover for themselves, firsthand, what the Bible says about God, people, and what it means to follow Jesus. The emphasis is on facilitation and discovery, not teaching, and immediate application and sharing what you’ve learned with others outside the group. It’s simple and reproducible.

For example, one of our microchurch leaders brought DBS into the jail system in one of the counties of Kansas City. The DBS’s quickly multiplied to every single pod in the entire jail, leading to a massive spiritual awakening and numerous salvations. As those people leave the jail, they join a microchurch called Share the Hope. Share the Hope has now multiplied DBS’s to the jail systems in three counties and birthed three microchurches. We’ve seen DBS work across multiple contexts, from the suburbs to the jail cells.

In the middle of the continuum, between informal and formal, you’ll see a category called Shapes and Symbols. We have eleven of these in all, which function as our visual parables for a visual culture. Each symbol or shape is built around a key area of life and are highly instructive on how to follow Jesus in that area. Each of these shapes or symbols can be shared in a few moments on napkin, over a coffee for an hour, or we’ve developed a series of DBS’s for each one that ranges from 3 to 6 weeks.

As you can see, it’s a bit more formal. The Shapes and Symbols could function as almost a year-long discipleship journey. Our set of shapes and tools includes a few that were developed by 3DM and others we created. Go to kcunderground.org/resources to explore a sample of three of our Shapes and Symbols, including overview videos and training pdfs.

Finally, at the far right of the continuum, you’ll see the formal category where our IDE’s and GPS sit. This suite of comprehensive disciple-making experiences is designed to bring real transformation to followers of Jesus. Modeled after Jesus’s disciple-making rhythms, these experiences teach spiritual habits; build genuine community; encourage high investment; multiply leaders; and unleash people to become missionaries where they live, work, learn and play. All of our experiences are outcome-focused: Our app helps leaders track both individual and community spiritual growth. Followers Made, reorients church consumers to become contributors to Jesus Mission. Missionaries Made equips disciples to become everyday missionaries where they live, work, learn and play. These are great places to start.

Leaders Made empowers servant leaders to guide and influence communities on mission.

The Microchurch Learning Community resources everyday missionaries to lead extended spiritual families in their neighborhoods or networks. These two are more advanced. Our GPS assessment process helps people discover their unique, personal calling. GPS is baked into all four experiences. You can learn more about these at disciplesmade.com.

Again, our goal is not for anyone to cut and paste our language or toolkit. Our language and tools are the overflow of decades of learning, experiments, many iterations, failures, grace, and grit; the shared work of many leaders bringing their best to table.

Consider the following Vocabulary Questions:

What would we discover if we audited our language?

What words and phrases do we want to seed into our disciple-making ecosystem?

What words and phrases do we want to remove?

What tools do we currently employ? How effective are they?

What tools need to be retired? What tools would we like to introduce?

How do we organize our tools? How do people know when to use what tool?

Owner-Making Ecosystem Question #4: The Vehicles Question What are the relational environments?

"Come follow me." This was first and foremost an invitation to relationship. Jesus didn’t gather his disciples for lattes at the synagogue once per week and conclude, “Make sure to fill out your Torah study. See you back here Sunday night at 6:00pm.” His discipleship was not compartmentalized into classroom settings or weekly small group meetings. Mark 3:14-15 tells us that he chose the Twelve, “that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach and to have authority to drive out demons.”

Dave Ferguson in his outstanding book Hero Maker: Five Essential Practices for Leaders to Multiply Leaders points out, “the word for ‘spend time’ in the Greek is pronounced ‘dia-tree-bo’ (and transliterated diatribe). Dia means ‘against’ and tribo means ‘to rub.’ So, diatribe literally means ‘to rub against’ or ‘to rub off.’” If you look at the simple percentage of time Jesus spent with his disciples, he most certainly rubbed off on them.

Fundamentally, the church is a family. We were broken in a family. We will only be healed in a new family, Jesus’ family, where He can rub off on us, in and through His people.

In chapter six, we identified five key relationships where discipleship happens in our lives. In each relational environment we need to understand how discipleship occurs and we need to set appropriate expectations for each context. This is how Jesus made disciples and how disciples were formed in the early church. Each of the relational environments is necessary at different times and in different ways as a person grows toward maturity in Christ:

Public Relationships: The church gathering corporately for worship. (Crowds)

Social Relationships: Networks of smaller relationships where we engage in mission and live out our faith in community. (The 72)

Personal Relationships: Small groups of six to sixteen people where we challenge and encourage one another on a regular basis. (The 12)

Transparent Relationships: Close relationships of three to four where we share intimate details of our lives for accountability. (The 3)

The Divine Relationship: Our relationship with Jesus Christ where we grow through the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit. (Father)

KC Underground Relational Environments Public Relationships:

Collective Gatherings:

A collective is a network of 4-6 microchurches in a geographic region or affinity group. A Collective Gathering is for all the members of those microchurches and are open to all.

Social, Personal and Transparent Relationships:

Hub Equipping Gathering (Social Space)

An equipping gathering is designed for the missionaries and microchurch leaders of the Underground. Theses gathering are comprised of vision, storytelling, worship, prayer, and equipping in missionary skills. It’s a gathering for the renewal and strengthening of leaders.

Micro-churches:

An extended spiritual family that lives in everyday gospel community, they are led by ordinary people and they own the mission of Jesus in a network of relationships. Most will find their transparent (the three), the personal (the twelve) and in many microchurches, the social space (the seventy-two) is experienced as they grow and throw parties in their context.
A group of missionaries who come together for a common mission in a particular context, working and praying together to see disciples made in their context and a micro-church emerge.

Discovery Bible Studies (DBS):

A group of people discovering Scripture together and learning to be obedient to Jesus. This is an expression of the personal relationships.

Intentional Disciple-Making Environments:

Followers Made, Leaders Made, Missionaries Made, Microchurch Learning Community. These are designed the twelve (Personal) with triads (Transparent) as subgroups.

Divine Space:

Time Alone with Jesus

Disciples are encouraged and equipped to spend time alone with Jesus each day.

Overtime, a person can experience all five of these spaces, overlapping and integrating, in one network or neighborhood, as people who “nest” their community within their microchurch, Collective, and Hub connection within their section of the city.

As we mentioned early, this way of life is radically counterculture. It usually takes a disciple months or years to begin to overlap and deepening their relational world in the following way. In this way,

rather than running between multiple networks of relationship, where community is a mile wide and an inch deep, they can plant their relational roots deep, in one network or neighborhood. In so doing, relationships are deep and wide. The pace of life can slow down, as much of our living happens in one or two contexts, not five or six, as is common sense in many places in America and is the source of much of our busyness and ensuing isolation.

Again, this is how the KC Underground answers the Vehicles question. We love our answer, we think it’s the best way to live. But, now it’s your turn. What is the Word and the Spirit saying to your community?

Considering the Following Vehicles Question:

Public Social Personal Transparent Divine

To what degree is our disciple-making organized and programmatic verses organic and relational?

What are our relational environments? List them. Then evaluate the following.

To what degree to those vehicles move people toward living in spiritual extended families that practice the “one anothers” as a way of life?

To what degree do they cover and integrate all five social spaces?

What relational environments do we have that are stagnant or toxic? Why? Should those vehicles be retired? How can those relational environments be restored to health?

What relational environments do we need?

Owner-Making Ecosystem Question #5: The Voyage Question What is the direction of the journey and the destination?

When I was in middle school, I had an early existential crisis. I didn’t know it at time, but I was a very unhealthy Three on the enneagram. If you’re not familiar with the enneagram, you must have had your head in the sand the last few years. image The enneagram is a system of personality typing that describes patterns in how people see the world and manage their emotions and relationships. Each type has a dark side. The three is the achiever. However, when a three is unhealthy, we slide toward the dark side of the Nine, which you could affectionally call the Chameleon.

As young teenager, I was the Chameleon. I could flow with any of the various clicks – athletes, band kids, smart kids, stoners – because I knew how to pretend. I had a whole backpack of masks I would wear through various moments of the day to entertain and impress whoever I was with. Like millions of other teenagers in American Lit, when I read Catcher in the Rye I realized, “I’m a phony!” I did indeed feel like an empty suit. The emptiness eventually led to a desperate prayer in the solitude of my bedroom, “God, can you help me? I don’t know who I am. I’m tired of all the masks and pretending.”

A few days later, I was tagging along with my sister, who was hanging at her best friend’s house. My sister’s best friend had an older sister, who was cool. She had a HUGE LP collection and was cranking some sweet tunes from the basement. I was playing bumper pool and nodding my head, enjoying the guitar licks. Then, I noticed this rock vocalist was singing about…Jesus. I shouted out loud, “What? Is he singing about Jesus? Rock music and Jesus? Can you do that?”

This pretty older woman explained that indeed, this is possible and acceptable. I was not going to disagree with her. The next day, I saw her at Sunday service, and she sought me out in the hallway. Did I mention she was an older woman?? Like 19! She said, “Rob, I made something for you,” and pulled a mixtape out of her purse. The older woman gave me a mixtape! Up to that point, this was the single greatest moment of my life. After I got home, I ran upstairs and turned it up. The shredding guitar burst out of the speakers and “melted my face.” I loved it. But as the song continued, my heart sunk.

The song was entitled, Chameleon, and it was my story. The lyrics said, “Chameleon, you blend with our surroundings. Chameleon, no one knows where you come from.” The song was a prophetic punch in the face, bemoaning the phoniness and pretending we pursue to impress others. The song ended with a call to find your identity in Christ.

I knew God was speaking to me, that somehow, He was answering my prayer. I prayed again, “Whatever this means God, please show me.”

The next Sunday, we had a big announcement in the service, “We have a new pastor! He is here to serve the youth!” He got up and said, “If you’re a teenager, I’d love to meet you. If you have questions about God and what it means to know Him, I’d love to talk. I’m having a cookout at my house tonight, come on over.”

My heart was beating fast. I knew God was telling me, “You’ll find your answer with that man.”

That man led me to Jesus, and then he took me on a journey that change the rest of my life. Not long after I started finally owning my faith and following Jesus, Dan started explaining to me and some other students, “Jesus had a plan. Many people read the gospels and think Jesus was some kind of hippie floating here and there. Jesus was more deliberate than any general has been with his armies. He had a plan for his disciples. Some of them were probably just a little older than you. Jesus wants to work the same plan with you.”

Then, Dan got out a white board and started drawing a sideways pyramid, with four sections. “First, he would win people, they would become disciples. Then, he would build them up in their faith, so they can experience all Jesus has for them. Next, he would equip them to win and build others. Finally, the fourth phase was multiply. Now, those disciples would win, build, equip, and multiply others, who would do the same. That’s what we are going to do. Jesus has won you, now it’s time to build and equip, so you can multiply.”

You read the story about that youth ministry in the opening pages of this book. It worked! He led me on a journey to a destination with Jesus. That framework was called the Son Life Strategy. Later, I read the Master Plan of Evangelism, which opened up me and millions of others to the Master’s Plan, the journey and the destination of Jesus. Since then, I’ve read hundreds of books that tease out the strategies of Jesus. His genius is inexhaustible!

How is that you are reflecting your best understanding of Jesus’ strategy in how He trained and developed others? What does the journey and destination look like? The destination continues on into eternity with God, where we will never fully arrive, but continue exploring His glories forever. But there is a clear direction toward that never-arrived-at destination. There are, indeed, stages in the journey.

The Bible provides a number of frameworks for the stages of the Journey. Here are a few that been distilled.

A Summary of Stages of Growth by Jim Putman:

Stage 1: Spiritually Dead

Stage 2: Spiritual Infant

Stage 3: Spiritual Child

Stage 4: Young Adult

Come and Follow (Develop),

Feed My Sheep (Lead and Multiply).

The Four Chair Discipling Model by Dan Spader
The T4T approach is uses the Four Fields as the major stages of the Journey

Field 1 – Engaging the Lost

Field 2 – Sharing the Gospel

Field 3 – Making Disciples

Field 4 – Church Formation
In the Underground, we have multiple answers to the Voyage question, offering what we hope are clear maps for the journey.

Example #1: The Missionary Pathway.

As a mission agency that exists to prepare missionaries and disciple-makers, our primary journey is what we call the Missionary Pathway. As we study the movement of the church in the New Testament and even modern-day movements, we see a pattern. This describes a journey a disciple goes on in new missionary endeavor in a new context.
Phase 1: Extraordinary Prayer and Fasting.

If you don't know where you are, start here. Even if you're in phase three, just keep working on phase one. Always. This is the most important phase. Remember, whatever your prayer rhythms are right now, add one thing. That one thing is extra. You just moved into extraordinary prayer. Add to the focus that comes through fasting. Extraordinary Prayer and Fasting remain the undercurrent in all phases. Pray for the ones you are sent to. Pray for laborers to be raised up in the harvest. Pray for People of Peace. Ask the Lord, “Where are you at work? How can I join you?”

Phase 2: Live Like a Missionary.

We first identify a missional focus: To what people and place have I been sent? I need to identify my primary mission context. Then we identify a person of peace (Luke 10) and we live the BLESS rhythms. We have been blessed to be a blessing (Genesis 12). Begin in Prayer. Learn the story of the people and places where you live, work, learn or play. Eat with them. Serve them. Then ask, what would be a meaningful engagement with the gospel for those people?

Phase 3: Plant the Gospel. Here we speak the gospel to ourselves and the people to whom Jesus has sent us. If we lead in prayer and know the people well, we will always discover ways to communicate good news...which also means we must be fluent in the gospel. So, learn to speak good news to your own soul every day. Plant the Gospel by helping others engage the

Scriptures in a way that facilitates self-discovery, immediate obedience and sharing with others.

Phase 4: Microchurch emerges. As we communicate the gospel and multiply disciples, the church will emerge. When you plant the gospel and make new disciples, you get the church. The church is an identity, not an action. It's who we are, not what we do. The church is an extended spiritual family, led by ordinary people, owning the mission of Jesus in a network of relationships.

Phase 5: Multiplication. The church that emerges out of true discipleship is a church with multiplication in its DNA. As the church emerges from disciple-making, multiplication will arise as well. We must reproduce at every level: disciples, leaders, microchurches, teams, gatherings, and networks.

We use the Missionary Pathway as a means to organize our training and tools. The Missionary Pathway is the annual liturgy for our Equipping Gathering, which serves the missionaries and microchurch leaders.

Example #2: The IDE Journey.

Jesus spent about 3 years making his disciples. So, do we. If you move through all four Intentional Disciple-making Experiences, it is a 3-year journey of discipleship, with the following destination: The equipping of ordinary people with the disciple-making and leadership skills to lead an extended spiritual family on mission.

Followers Made:

Followers Made is a transformative, six-month experience that helps participants develop Jesus-like character and begin to discover their unique calling. Grounded in daily spiritual practices, the experience leads people to create long-lasting, life-changing habits. Followers Made also guides the creation of vulnerable, accountable community, as participants learn to support each other on 3and 12-person levels.
Leaders Made is an intense, focused experience to develop disciples who inspire and guide others along the same path—just as Jesus did. Leaders Made uses the same app tools as Followers Made to enable and track growth. During the 10-month journey, participants will read through most of the Bible and strengthen their spiritual habits. They will dive even deeper into their calling exploration to discern where their leadership can make the greatest kingdom impact.
Missionaries Made is based on the fundamental belief that God is already at work redeeming and restoring all people and all things—and all we need to do is join Him. This experience helps people discover how to join Jesus in blessing the people they live, work, learn and play with. In just over three months, participants start to build habits based on the five rhythms of missionary life: Begin in prayer, Listen and engage, Eat, Serve and Story (BLESS).
When people start following the rhythms of missional living, a new community naturally starts to form. What then? The Microchurch Learning Community equips everyday missionaries to launch and lead the extended spiritual families that emerge from open, generous living. Grounded in the Way of the early church, this year-long experience helps participants develop the habits and skills necessary to grow thriving on-mission communities that make the gospel tangible to others. The Microchurch Learning

Community transforms personal evangelism from presentations and programs to a vibrant, missionary way of life that will expand your impact exponentially.

Example #3 Harvest to the Church, Church to the Harvest

As was explained with the Informal to Formal tools continuum, we are always pushing the church toward the harvest field, while we are inviting those in the harvest toward the church. It’s a cyclical motion that never ends. In a subversive, but not overt way, the win, build, equip, multiply framework, buried so deep in me, informs our informal to formal tool continuum. Our informal tools like BLESS and DBS are in the win phase. The shapes and symbols are mostly in the build phase, with a few shapes in the equip phase. The formal tools are about equip and multiply, which takes us back to the harvest where the multiplication happens.

Finally, one more time, our answers are not “the right answers” for the Voyage question. It is our best answer for our faith community at this time, under the guidance of the Word and the Spirit, as best as we can discern it. We offer it to you, with prayers that it may help you as your community enters the same process of discernment.

Consider the Following Voyage Questions:

How would you describe the journey and the destination of our disciple-making ecosystem?

What are the stages and the phases?

How clearly do you think those you are inviting into the journey understand those various phases? Is there a clear map for the journey?

How well do you believe your journey has been informed by the Scriptures and the testimony of the church in her best hours?

As we finish this portion of the book, we are moving from a focus on the cultivation of environments and ecosystems for disciple-making multiplication to the cultivation of environments and ecosystems for leadership development and multiplication. Everything rises and falls on our disciple-making

systems. In fact, disciple-making and leadership development are two-sides of the same coin. If your disciples and leaders are healthy, you’ll end up producing healthy, multiplying microchurches, hubs, and networks. Then, you’ll have a movement on your hands! Let’s explore finally how to bring the collective genius of a decentralized network together for the best decision-making and the brightest future.

Chapter 14
Process & Systems

The complexity of systems requires that we engage everybody just so we can harvest the intelligence that

exists throughout the organization. –Margaret Wheatley, Finding Our Way

The earth functions as an ecosystem designed by the Spirit of God. It embodies unmatched beauty and intricacy that is both fragile and resilient. It adjusts, renews, and sustains itself in precise organization from its own cells and organisms. The ecology of the earth provides some wonderful clues for developing movemental organizations.

The first time I (Lance) went white water rafting, within 30 seconds I thought I was going to die because I couldn’t breath. I was at the front of the raft and a huge splash of ice-cold water plastered my entire body. For what seemed like several minutes I gasped desperately for air. If you have ever gone white water rafting you know the thrill, the fear, the shocking cold, and the overall exhilaration of going with the biggest of flows.

Movements are like rivers. They gush and flow, are shallow in some places and deep in others. Ripples and splashes at the top are full of fast action. They appear impressive. But it is the currents underneath the surface where the real power resides.

It’s the rocky spots that cause the most noise but the systemic processes we develop in our networks, churches, and businesses determine movemental power flow and successful mission objectives.

In Radical Inclusion Ori shares the story of Jasper—a high school dropout and Vietnam veteran that worked transporting patients between rooms and emptying the trash at the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia. The hospital was urgently trying to dissipate the spread of MRSA—the antibioticresistant staph infection that plagues many hospitals. For over a century, health professionals have known that washing hands and regularly wearing gloves and gowns is effective in prevention of MRSA.

The hospital’s head of infection control gathered a select group of staff members drawn from all ranks and responsibilities, from surgeons to janitors to work on heading off the rate of infection. It was during this session that Jasper would do something that would literally save lives. He shared that he had noticed the garbage cans in a wing with many MRSA infections were always mostly empty and had no used gloves in them. The group went to that wing to try to figure out why the nurses weren’t using gloves. Strangely enough, it just so happened that all the nurses in the wing had very small hands. The hospital stocked equal numbers of each glove size. This wing used many more extra-small gloves and would always run out before the others. Larger gloves were too unwieldy and made simple tasks awkward, so the nurses were seldom using gloves at all.

The head of infection control asked the nurses if they would wear gloves if their size were continually stocked. The nurses said, “Of course we would.” Jasper wrote down his direct phone number and gave it to the nurse’s station so that if the wing was running low on extra-small gloves, they just needed to call him, and Jasper would refill the stock within minutes. Within a year the patient mortality rate had been reduced by 70 percent.

Jasper represents a cell in the body. In the midst of a crisis the information he contained was priceless and his voice was the most important one in the room. He was not a medical expert and had no medical training to speak of. Yet the process of asking the people most close to the situation to share their thoughts, ideas, and observations gave place for Jasper’s astute observation to intervene and save lives. This is a shining example of the system of Collective Intelligence at work.
Every organization is a network of relationships. We either ignore or forget this fact to our own loss. The central nervous system is the people themselves. It has the capacity to receive outside and inside information, process it, and act accordingly. It is what makes a body work. When disconnections, such as a spinal cord injury, come about, the CNS loses its ability to function properly and movement or death is at risk. How the system is regulated, maintained, and opened or closed determines the effectiveness of our systems. This is a matter of processes. The right practices draw from present relationships and deepen them as well. Margaret Wheatley writes

We’ve lost confidence in our great human capabilities, partly because mechanistic organizational processes have separated and divided us and made us fearful and distrusting of one another. We need processes to help us reweave connections, to discover shared interests, to listen to one another’s stories and dreams. We need processes that take advantage of our natural ability to network, to communicate when something is meaningful to us.98

While on staff at a large church led by the hierarchy of a senior pastor and executive pastor I (Lance) received a harsh phone call from the senior pastor after I had sent an email to the executive pastor taking issue with the Christmas weekend staff schedule. The schedule had been announced without any input from staff members. It meant the entire staff would be working on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, which was unnecessary. I was offering an alternative solution and had an idea about how to make it happen. The senior pastor called me and asked him if I had been “polling” other staff members and warned me that if he had, it would be grounds for serious discipline.

Two guys made a unilateral decision, affecting every staff member, their immediate families, and their extended families, without any input from a large team of creative and smart men and women.

In Ephesians 4:16 the apostle Paul wrote, “the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. Where a trusting community culture exists, creativity and responsibility course through the life of the body. There is collective ownership of the vision by the community of saints when we operate under the Spirit’s design. The accomplishment of the vision is not regulated, dominated, or commandeered by one or a few higher-ups. Teams begin to form, and life explodes through the collective gifts and talents of the men and women God has called together.

Those who leave pyramid forms of leadership behind must develop new processes and practices to fill the void left by managers and bosses. Who decides the where, what, when, and how issues of strategic initiatives, schedules, programming, production, etc.? How do conflicts get resolved? How are salaries decided upon? Since leadership is about power a commitment away from hierarchal leadership means we must work to develop a new power grid for our organization. What might that look like?

A typical GM factory in the 1980s evoked every stereotype we have of an assembly line. Each worker was responsible for a single task, and the hierarchy was rigid and clear. The system was producing cars that were at best okay. If an employee made a mistake or detected a problem, he could stop the line, whereupon a loud alarm would sound. Get ready to be critiqued! You’re a problem.

The Toyota assembly line was drastically different. Employees were regarded as members of a team, and each team member was considered an important contributor and given a high level of

autonomy. What happened if an employee stopped the line? A pleasant “ding-dong” would sound, and

teams would carefully study what was going on, in an effort to continually improve the process. Line workers were constantly encouraged to make suggestions.

Take a moment and imagine that you’re the head of Toyota. How many worker suggestions would you implement? Assuming that the majority of suggestions are well meaning but erroneous—15 percent? Playing the odds that half of the suggestions are likely to be helpful—50 percent? Try 100 percent. Just like Wikipedia edits, each and every suggestion made by a Toyota line worker was implemented. In decentralized fashion, teams functioned like a circle, and whatever ideas employees had for innovation were put into practice. And in Wikipedia fashion, if someone’s suggestion proved counterproductive, another employee would inevitably make a suggestion to undo the previous suggestion. This was an entirely different way of dealing with employees. Rather than regarding line workers as drones who had to follow directions and be kept in line, Toyota viewed its employees as key assets. Imagine the line workers’ feeling of empowerment. Their opinions mattered. But Toyota didn’t stop there. It also flattened its management hierarchy and equalized the pay scale. Now everyone was in it together.

GM proposed, almost in a dare, that the Japanese take over management of its Fremont, California, auto plant, one of the company’s lowest-producing plants. They could run the plant as they see fit, but they had to use the same union force. The results were staggering. Within three years, it was one of GM’s most efficient plants. Their productivity was 60% higher than other comparable GM plants! 99

100% inclusion of input. A new power grid indeed! That’s a living system, even in a factory.

In Radical Inclusion, Ori wrote

(It is) the leader’s responsibility to harvest the knowledge that exists throughout the organization and to build a broader understanding of the ways the team’s abilities can be aligned to solve the problem.

Rather than the leader bearing the immense responsibility of discovering solutions unilaterally or alone, solving the problem becomes a matter of narrowing down a diverse list of creative solutions proposed by the team.100

The dominant leadership theory of our time is based primarily on psychology—how to influence and manipulate others, rather than biology and physics—how life, growth, and interconnectivity happens and orders itself.

In A Failure of Nerve, Edwin Friedman wrote, “Recent findings about the brain-body connection have the potential to revolutionize our concept of hierarchy. For they suggest that to a large extent we have a liquid nervous system. The brain turns out to function like a gland. It is the largest organ of secretion, communicating simultaneously with various parts of the body, both near and far, through the reciprocal transmission of substances known as neurotransmitters. In other words, the head is present in the body!101”Amazingly enough, to this very day scientist cannot exactly figure out how starfish move. They have no central brain yet somehow when one arm moves the other arms know to move with it. The head is present in the body.

For the church, the body of Christ, Jesus is the head. He is the only head. Neither a senior pastor nor any other human is the head of any local church. Calling oneself head pastor is not only theologically incorrect it is usurping the authority of Christ himself and circumvents the flow of his wisdom and understanding through the rest of the body of Christ.

Committing to a living system of Collective Intelligence frees our organizations to the sub-intelligences of:
Daniel Goleman spread the concepts of emotional intelligence and points to five keys that compile it—Self-awareness, Self-regulation, Motivation, Empathy, and Social skills.
This is the ability to learn, understand, and comprehend knowledge as it relates to interpersonal dynamics. The more relationally intelligent we become, the more we will demonstrate increased love, respect, and trust in every relationship in our lives, which will inevitably elevate our influence.102
This is what helps organizations looking beyond themselves by providing its members any and all information available to make informed decisions.

Daniel Cable writes,

Most neuroscientists agree that one of the most basic emotional systems pertains to a functionally identifiable neural circuit that depends on dopamine, and that emotional system might be called interest, anticipation, or seeking. This means that the seeking system is a real place in the brain: a neural network that runs between the prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum. When the seeking system is activated, we experience persistent feelings of interest, curiosity, sensation seeking, and in the presence of a sufficiently complex cortex, the search for higher meaning.103

Role-Based Titles

In the early 1900’s there was an exceptional pitcher in Major League Baseball with a career earned run average of 2.28 that still ranks in the top 15 of all time. His win/loss record was 94-46, led his league in shutouts in 1916 and was in the top five for strikeouts in two of his five seasons as a pitcher. This dominant hurler’s name was Babe Ruth. Most nominal sports fan know who Babe Ruth was, but many dedicated baseball fans are unaware he was a great pitcher. So why did he only pitch for five seasons if he was so great? Because he was an even better hitter and the wise decision was made to let him focus his skills with the bat. However, there were a handful of times Ruth was used as a pitcher later in his career when his team was shorthanded in that position. To just call him a great pitcher or a great hitter would be to fall short. No, Babe Ruth was a great baseball player.

When we pigeonhole people to singular titles chances are, we take others or ourselves out of consideration for filling in during times of need or change. Or we occupy a position that another better player could fill.

102 https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/student-learning-relational-intelligence/
In the arena of church planting an oft-repeated cycle takes place to the determent of the development of the church.

Someone with an apostolic gifting usually starts a given church plant. These people are the Innovators within Everett Rogers’ scale called the Diffusion of Innovations and they

represent around three percent of an organization’s populace. Innovators have a magnetic presence and ability to influence. They attract other innovators and those Rogers termed Early Adopters. These are the folks that see a new idea, quickly assess it, and are some of the first to buy in. Early Adopters represent about 13% of a group.

As a young church begins to get started it is typically the innovators and early adopters that jump on board early on. As it begins to grow and develop two other types which Rogers called Early Majority and Late Majority join up. Quite often the person with the Innovative/Apostolic gifting does not possess strong shepherd/pastor skills. Two issues very often come into play as the church adds people. They need what a pastor brings but all they have is an apostle. And he or she is likely occupied and passionate about future steps, dreaming of the next hill to take. Many church plants plateau at this point, unless a team develops. Some organizational theorists call this the founders trap.

On rare occasions the innovator/apostle transitions into the role of shepherd/pastor, or unsuccessfully attempts to do so. Frustration mounts when an apostolic/innovator type tries to fill the shepherd role because a void exists in that role. More often than not leaders who attempt this are not even aware that they are trying to fill a different role. They are just trying to help the people in their fellowship.

As a young church planter, I (Lance) experienced this exact scenario. My innovative gifts are fairly strong. My pastoral gifts? Uh, em, not so much. The problem was that from the very beginning of the church plant my title was Senior Pastor. So, everyone, including myself, expected me to be the expert pastor. As the church grew all of us were frustrated! I felt inadequate and like a failing leader. It wasn’t until we began to bring on others with pastoring skills that we moved past a stage of growth stall.

Churches that move past the founder’s trap usually develop a team with other roles (prophetic, evangelistic) represented. We have come to believe churches should be started with teams with as many roles of the five types mentioned in Ephesians 4:11-12 as possible:

And he (Jesus) gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ.

Earlier in the book we covered the reasons for moving beyond rank-based titles that underscore status. But if we drop titles altogether how are we to identify who does what and who to contact regarding the what? Many of the leaders and organizations we have learned from and researched for this book have found wisdom and yes, fun, in creating role-based titles that describe what a person does rather than who that person in the role is.

The company, HolocracyOne, uses the term “lead link” as the term for the role of a department leader. The term “link” promotes a connecting catalytic and co-working ethos rather than a rank or status culture. Lead link titles are fun and based on the actual role or function of the position. For instance, the lead link role for social media outreach is named Social Media Butterfly, with a purpose to “Pollinate the web with Holacracy”.

Our friend J.R. Woodward has developed some wonderfully imaginative and helpful role-based titles for the five giftings mentioned in the Ephesians text above

Apostles = Dream Awakeners Prophets = Heart Revealers Evangelists = Story Tellers Pastors = Soul Healers Teachers = Light Givers

A change to role-based titles takes the edge off hierarchy emphasis. Especially when we leave behind status pre-descriptors such as Senior , Executive etc.

The Make-a-Wish foundation implemented a policy that allowed its people to create his or her own rolebased titles. The then CEO, Susan Fenters came up with “Fairy Godmother of Wishes” for her role. Other titles included “Minister of Dollars and Sense”, “Duchess of Data” (database manager), “Heralder of Happy News” (PR managers).104
In the spirit of mutual submission, a multitude of organizations in our research were found to use some form of “advice process.” This process is not complex.

Anyone in any particular department or domain can make a decision but prior to doing so must

seek advice from all affected parties and people with expertise on the matter.105

The person weighing a decision is not beholden to incorporate every piece of advice in order to create consensus or compromise.

The point is to take wise counsel seriously into consideration and to thoughtfully evaluate how the decision will affect others within the organization both positively and negatively.

Typically, we believe decisions are made in one of two ways: The boss (hierarchy) decides or a vote (consensus) is taken. An advice process exceeds both of these options. Those who will be affected or who have a vested interest are heard and the people closest to an issue have the power to move beyond bureaucracy and the slow and frustrating course of consensus in order to make a speedier and informed decision.

Dennis Bakke underscores the paybacks of a good advice process:

It draws people whose advice is sought into the issue and proposition at hand. They become informed of the subjects and become conversant censors or supporters. The sharing of information reinforces the feeling of community and perpetuates a feeling of honor and value.

The act of seeking advice is an act of humility. Often a senior leader (elder) may hesitate to seek advice from other less experienced team members out of concern that his “all knowing” reputation or responsibility will be tarnished. What if the worker thinks, “Shouldn’t he know what to do? Why is he asking me?” When an advice process is common practice this concern is goes out the window.

It is educational. It creates peer-to-peer learning opportunities and mines the knowledge nuggets of those in the field.

The odds for the best decision are greatly enhanced versus a top-down approach. The one making the decision is closest to the issue and will be held accountable by those who gave advice for the consequences of the decision.

The process is plain fun. It is a team making activity that stimulates creativity and camaraderie.106

It is important to clarify that seeking to eschew unilateral decisions with a good advice process is not consensus. On the surface consensus sounds generous but functionally it can bog down progress through the paralysis of analysis, perpetuate ego trips, hurt feelings, and quasi-filibusters. When consensus is incorporated it mitigates accountability. No one is ultimately held responsible because the majority voted to go a particular way. Frederic Laloux suggests

With the advice process, the ownership for the decision stays clearly with one person: the decision maker. Convinced that she made the best possible decision, she sees things through with great enthusiasm, trying to prove to advice givers that their trust was well placed or their objections immaterial. While consensus drains energy out of organizations, the advice process boosts motivation and initiative.107
Be subject ... to every fellow worker and laborer.

Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

Ephesians 5:21

In the book Unleader I (Lance) wrote of how mutual submission is seen in a local church setting. Visiting with my friend, David Fitch, professor at Northern Seminary and the founding pastor of Life on the Vine Christian Community he began by saying that as a person with strong apostolic gifting he does in fact come up with a lot of ideas. He is a prototypical innovator, a forward thinker with a heavy dose of entrepreneurial overtones. David said, “When I have an idea, concern, or opinion on an issue, I bring it to the other members of the team of five-fold (Ephesians 4:11-12) elders and say, ‘I have something I want to submit to you.’” At that point, David stopped and said, “Do you see that? I say, ‘I want to submit this to you.’” David mentioned the use of submissive language to season the conversation in grace and

humility and to emphasize the mutual submission he and the others were committed to. He then discussed how the idea he laid on the table would be handled.

If all the other elders are in agreement, the idea will then be submitted in prayer, set on the proverbial altar before the Lord for a time, and revisited to see if God had spoken anything different to any team members in the meantime. The same scenario is played out if there is disagreement from any or all of the other elders. The idea or issue is submitted to the Lord in prayer and revisited later. If there is still not complete agreement on how to move forward, the issue is left on the prayer altar indefinitely. David then grabbed a napkin and began to sketch out three points that he has subsequently blogged on:
Anyone in a recognized role of leadership is called to maintain the posture of submission to Jesus Christ as Lord of the church and to model the posture of mutual submission to all others who are in the sphere of leadership. It is from this position that one can expect to witness God’s truth revealed for the fellowship.
Jesus lays out a detailed process in Matthew 18 that provides fundamental steps for navigating disputable matters or issues that arise within the community of his followers. The binding and loosing terminology open this process for application beyond sin issues between individuals.

Fitch writes,

We go to one another and in humility discuss the issue. If we believe someone is in sin, we say that and then submit ourselves to that person, being careful to listen as to why we might be wrong. If agreement cannot be reached, if insubordination is detected, we then bring in a third person. At the point where an issue simply cannot be agreed upon (and these issues are rare and outside the creedal orthodoxies that guide a given church), then we take it to the elders, then to the community to study and pray over the issue (Acts 15:28).

Making Sure All The Voices Are Heard

Once you assessed everyone on your team for their APEST profile, Steve Cockrum, author of Five Voices: How to Connect Effectively with Everyone You Lead, recommends trying these rules of engagement so that everyone can be heard and leveraged for the greatest collective genius. This little shift in practice in the KC Underground leadership team has unleashed so much wisdom into our decision-making! Remember the apostolic guy is writing this, which means I’ve had to get use to going last. So hard, at first. Now, I actually love it.

In a group discussion, make sure:

Shepherds go first:

Because they don’t like to disagree with what’s already been said.

But they represent 43% of the people in the organization!

Promise not to critique them right off the bad. Prophets go next:

Let them think outside the box and take risks.

Don’t judge them right off.

Ask them clarifying question. Teachers go third:

Encourage them to ask the difficult questions and show us where we’re making mistakes.

Let them do due diligence. Evangelists go fourth:

Sell it for all it’s worth and make us cry if you need to.

When we challenge, don’t take it personally. Apostles go last:

Listen first while everyone else talks, even though that’s probably very hard for you.

Be careful with your critique, so that it’s not too sharp.

Help us dream and see the future!

drives the issues that will determine the direction of the church, not the single chosen leader who shall determine what shall be discerned, what shall be tolerated, and what shall [not be] allowed.108
Having its roots in the word pneuma (spirit), the idea of a spirit-driven leadership certainly is what we all should be searching for. In terms of governance or leadership, the idea of pneumatocracy speaks of a collective voice derived from apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors who are recognized by the faith community. “Each one must be given authority for what gifts God has given them. Yet they must exercise that gift in grace and humility (Romans 12:3-4).”109
With a fleet of 200 trucks and three processing plants Morning Star produces 40 percent of diced tomatoes and tomato paste consumed in the United States. Depending on harvest season, between 400 and 2400 people are working at Morning Star at any given time. But there are no management positions or HR department. How does this large company deal with conflict that is certain to come about from time to time in a company of this size?
We have found it uncanny that a multitude of large corporations (over 100 employees) have developed a dismissal process that virtually mirrors the way Jesus taught conflict resolution in Matthew 18. At Morning Star for example should circumstances deem it necessary for someone to leave the company the accountability process comes into play:

Have a direct conversation with the person. No gossiping. No backbiting allowed. Anyone noticing a coworker with performance or integrity issues in conflict with the company’s values is required to discuss the issue directly with their coworker. If a person is unwilling to initiate a discussion along these lines, then they just have to live with it.

If the one-on-one conversation does not bring resolve, then another person is brought into the discussion as a mediator. This person must be trusted by both colleagues, listen to both parties, clarify what they have heard, and share their thoughts on points made by both coworkers. The mediator is not an arbiter that makes a determination. The power and resolution continue to be in the hands of the two coworkers. The mediator is important to keep the conversation on track and to facilitate mutual understanding. Some differences of opinion do not result in a resolution; especially if one colleague asks another colleague to terminate his or her own employment.

If differences of opinion between coworkers cannot be resolved a panel of three colleagues are convened to listen to both sides and pursue the conversation until resolution. Doug Kirkpatrick writes, “If the panel became deadlocked, the company owner participates in the deliberations and renders a final decision. At some point, all disputes must come to an end.110

Dismissal Process (via Accountability Process: above)

A process such as this eliminates the impetuousness of unilateral firings by one or two higher ups and follows a Jesusy way of treating others. An important aspect of this sort of dismissal process is that it provides a great opportunity for a team member who is experiencing performance issues to move to a role that better fits his giftings, talents, and skills. Sometimes a person simply does not fit in an organization. Dismissal via accountability process oftentimes helps a person discover this own their own.
When broad problems or issues needing decisions arise in aggressive organizational cultures dominated by type A and high D people the sway of decision making often comes from the quickest to speak, high paced person(s) in the room.

There are ways for resolving conflicts in a spirit of humility and nonaggression whereby every personality type has an equal voice:
Consider the majority of social media conflict (which seems to be the majority of its content). People predominantly yell via keyboard, argue their position, do not practice seeking to understand the other person, etc. Few people get convinced of an opinion they previously disagreed with. It is an overall aggressive platform for disagreement. Many face-to-face disagreements carry these same aspects of aggression to one degree or another.

Let’s go back to the circle—which we spent a good time considering earlier in the book. The circle is a form of equality. No one is at the head of the table. Facing one another, we lay down our personal agendas and demonstrate we are willing to listen so hard that we are prepared to risk forgetting what we hoped to say.

The circle helps settle our emotions because it reminds us that we will have a chance to be heard while reminding us it is important to hear our coworker’s points of view. It stirs curiosity and awakens our imagination.

The circle session begins by drawing everyone in by hearing everyone’s voice.

Everyone in the circle is asked to answer these questions and colleagues are encouraged to hear one another’s heart.

Circle questions:

How does this issue relate to your personal experiences?

How will the decision on this issue affect you moving forward? What outcome are you hoping for when we leave the circle today?
At this stage we begin to discuss the issue at hand. In doing so we ask questions of those who have differing opinion in regard to the proper solution for the given issue. The posture, tone, and respect we show to one another is to genuinely seek to understand the points of argument by the other person(s).

Circle question:

What am I hearing that makes sense and could provide a better answer than I currently have?

Assemble the Discoveries

Through humble listening, at this stage some key points of knowledge, wisdom, and mutual understanding has most likely surfaced. This is when we may choose to pull out the flip charts and whiteboard to begin collecting what we have learned.

Checking the vitals of our Circle:

Who is missing from this conversation?

What did we just see or hear?

Have we been honest and open?

Who are we right now?
At this point we have practiced what have said we believe and value. We are one body, a family, where everyone has equal voice and value. We have demonstrated faith in believing our collective presence contains the wisdom, knowledge, and skill from God’s Spirit to take us where we need to go. This is where we propose our refined solutions, the answers that have been processed (refined) through the gifts and wisdom of those we have become one with.
Every human being alive represents the Imago Dei, which means every person is infused with infinite value and unimaginable God-given potential. Furthermore, the Spirit of God is in His people, the very same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead. When we come together under the headship of Jesus, wonderful, even miraculous things can and do happen in our midst. In fact, Jesus said we would do even greater things that He did, as hard as that is to imagine. Laying down the reigns of hierarchical leadership and picking up the towel and basin of servantship is essential, if we are to see that lofty vision realized.

In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God,

did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing

by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.

Philippians 2:5-7

Jesus, being in very nature God. Let me remind you who Jesus is: The King of Kings. The Lord of Lords. The first and the last, the alpha and the omega, the apex of all that is. Jesus is the centerpiece and Sun of God’s Universe. Jesus isn’t just the middle or the margins, He is the whole show, He’s the whole point of History. The entire Heavenly realm – the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the angelic hosts are occupied with one person – Jesus. The entire universe was created by Jesus, through Jesus, and for Jesus. He is the Creator and Sustainer everything in all of creation is held together in him. Jesus is the key that unlocks the entire canon of Scripture. Every passage in every book, both Old Testament and New Testament, are ultimately occupied with one person, Jesus. All Scripture proclaims Him. The Father exalts Him. The Spirit magnifies Him. The angels worship Him. The church exists to follow Him. He is in

fact, Almighty God, Sovereign and Supreme. May our eyes be opened to see his greatness! Because Jesus trumps everything.111

When we drop to our feet to worship Jesus with awe and wonder, fear and trembling; we are astounded beyond words to find him bowing down at our feet, washing them with a basin and a towel.

Jesus got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. John 13:4

The room had to grow very quiet as the status-seeking disciples quietly watch the Creator of the World, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords bend down to wash their dirty, smelly feet. A task reserved for the lowest of servants. The washing of feet was a task regarded as so lowly, so demeaning, that even Jewish slaves did not have to do it. Ancient stories tell us, in the Jewish world, that if at all possible, this was reserved for Gentile slaves. You know what you can’t find in history prior to Jesus? There had never before been a story of anyone of a higher status washing the feet of someone of lower status. That never happened until this night. Jesus is the origin of Starfish leadership.

Do you know what greatness looks like in God’s eyes? Washing feet. Jesus took on the “very nature” of a servant. Service and generosity are an “all of life” deal. Service and generosity were the pervasive worldview of Jesus. Service isn’t something you do; it’s who you are – a servant. It becomes persuasive in every area of our lives. Service is not just an activity, but an identity. Service isn’t about an outward performance, but an inner posture.

Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. John 13:14

If it were possible, dear reader, at this point, we would love to remove your shoes, bow down, and wash your feet. If we did, however, we would find that Jesus had already beaten us there.

This little book is our alabaster jar that we have broken at the feet of Jesus. It’s our costly gift to Him, that in many ways is the sum of our life’s work, and it is here for His pleasure. That is enough.

It is our sincere prayer that you, the Beloved of God, have rediscovered truths that have awakened again the wild holy rumpus in you. In the name of Jesus, we pray you will carry these Starfish with you and see them unleash the freedom of God, the genius of His body, the fullness of Jesus, and a movement of reproducing disciples, leaders, houses, hubs, and networks, until the good things of God are running wild!
