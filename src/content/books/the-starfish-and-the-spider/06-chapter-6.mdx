---# Chapter 13: Crafting Your Disciple-Making Ecosystem

> "Words matter. Definitions matter. We can’t measure success in disciple-making if we don’t know what our definition of one is."

## Defining a Disciple

One persistent challenge in disciple-making is that few can articulate a clear definition of a disciple—let alone recall it five minutes later. We must therefore ask: *What exactly is our definition of a disciple?* Without a working definition, any measure of success in disciple-making is arbitrary.

Consider these qualifiers as you craft or refine your definition:

- **Is it Biblical?**  
  Is it firmly grounded in deep biblical convictions, tested over time and affirmed by the testimony of the Church Universal?
- **What are your core theological convictions about disciple-making?**
- **Is it robust?**  
  If someone lived into this definition, would they resemble the disciples depicted in the New Testament—people who turned the world upside down? What are the irreducible minimums required to make it robust?
- **Is it simple?**  
  Can you share it with a young teenager and have them understand it?
- **Is it reproducible?**  
  Can the average person easily remember it and share it with others?
- **Is it compelling?**  
  Does it quicken your heart when you share it? Does it remain compelling for people at various stages of spiritual maturity? Will it stay compelling over a lifetime?

The first two questions ensure a solid foundation. The third and fourth allow your definition to scale into a movement. The last captures hearts and minds, generating widespread participation and motivation.

### The KC Underground Example

**Our definition:**  
*Double-click: Click One and Click Two.*

#### Click One: Character × Calling = Impact

If you ask disciple-makers in our movement what it means to be a disciple, they'll say:  
**"Character × Calling = Impact!"**

This phrase, introduced in Chapter 4, is simple, reproducible, and compelling—just three words! We also train people to expand on the meaning with this invitation:

> "Ever feel like you’re not living, just existing? Jesus said, 'I have come that you might have life and have it to the full' (John 10:10)! Jesus is inviting us to live the fully alive life. As the Author of Life, He can show us how to come alive in every area.  
> 
> Accept Jesus as your teacher, and you’ll experience transformation in two major areas: Character and Calling.  
> 
> **Character** is becoming like Jesus—more love, more joy, more peace, more patience, more kindness, more goodness, more gentleness, more self-control. Imagine closing the gap between who you are and who you want to be, and seeing your relationships deepen in quality.  
> 
> **Calling** is about making your unique contribution, designed by God. Grow in Character (Fruit of the Spirit) and Calling (Gifts of the Spirit), and your impact multiplies—both in you and through you.  
> 
> That’s the transformation Jesus wants for all of us. Character × Calling = Impact!"

#### Click Two: One Sentence Definition

>A disciple is a person apprenticed to Jesus in the fully alive life, experiencing habit-fueled, ongoing transformation in character and calling, while moving deeper into community and multiplying disciples.

This expanded version is what we equip our leaders to know. We believe it is both biblical and robust.

##### Our Five Tectonic-Level Theological Convictions

A disciple is...

1. **Focused on the Spirit’s Outcomes**
2. **Fueled by Spiritual Habits that Jesus Embodied**
3. **Forged by Community that Jesus Modeled**
4. **Fixated on the Mission of Jesus**
5. **Flavored by the Gospel of Jesus**

These convictions shape everything: our message, mediums, and methods.

**Reflection:**  
Based on your theological reflections and how you embody the life of Jesus, consider these five questions as you define your vision of a disciple.

# Owner-Making Ecosystem Questions

## Question #2: The Voice Question

**Who listens to you and is ready to respond?**

Start right, stay right. The initial direction sets the trajectory for the entire journey—a lesson illustrated by the tragedy of Air New Zealand Flight 901, whose slight navigational error led to disaster. Likewise, how people are invited into the discipleship journey profoundly matters.

Too often, invitations are broad “cattle calls,” or are extended only to the most competent by cultural standards, excluding those who are hungry or humble. Many pastors underestimate the capacity of their people to commit, fearing anything beyond a few weeks is “too much.” This approach is more than "two degrees off" from Jesus’s methods.

### Jesus’ Criteria for Devotion: High Invitation, High Challenge

According to Mike Breen’s *Building a Discipling Culture*:

- **High Invitation:** Implies a sense of grace and warm inclusion, based on who you are rather than what you do. It brings rest—a feeling of “I belong.”
- **High Challenge:** Implies being needed, having a valued contribution, and being called to do costly, hard things. Challenge stirs us to action and growth.

Jesus’ first invitation to Peter was “Come and see” (John 1:39)—purely invitational. Later, with “Come, follow me... and I will make you fishers of men” (Matthew 4:19), He combined high invitation and high challenge.

Both are necessary for development. Without challenge, there’s no growth; without invitation, there’s no willingness.

### Jesus’ Criteria for Selection

- **Readiness**  
  - Who listens to my voice and is ready to respond?
  - Who is hungry, responsive, teachable, and available?
  - Who is willing to invest in others as I invest in them? (Luke 9:57–62)
- **Revelation**  
  - Who has the Father given to me? (Luke 6:12)

### Jesus’ Criteria for Invitation

- **Personal**: Jesus called disciples by name. In other words, no broad calls.
- **Limited**: Only twelve, with an inner core of three. (Luke 6:13–16; Mark 5:37; Matthew 17:1; Luke 8:51)

---

#### KC Underground Example

For inviting leaders into intentional disciple-making environments (e.g., Followers Made), we follow Jesus’ example:

1. **Prayer:** Begin with intentional prayer—“Lord, put a lightbulb over the right people’s heads.”
2. **Selection:** Identify those responding to your voice, who are hungry and teachable; group size is twelve, organized in triads.
3. **Invitation:** Invite these “lightbulb people” to read a relevant book (e.g., *Not a Fan* by Kyle Idleman) and pray about joining a six-month journey.
4. **Commitment:** Only those who finish reading and attend the Information Huddle (commitment meeting) are invited into the journey.

Our dropout rate for Followers Made is less than 5%, and 30% of participants later make disciples themselves.

---

### Reflection Questions for the Voice Question

- **Devotion:** What commitment level do you request when inviting someone into the discipleship journey? Is it both highly invitational and highly challenging?
- **Selection:** What criteria do you use to choose disciples? Does it align with Jesus’ way of selecting the hungry, humble, and those who are willing?
- **Invitation:** How many do you invest in at a time, and how do you invite them? Have you personally invited your “twelve” and your “three” to the journey?

---

## Question #3: The Vocabulary Question

**What language and tools will you use?**

Language brings order from chaos. The power of language is seen in Genesis 1, where God’s words not only convey information but create new realities: first He forms, then He fills. Language creates culture in every trade or practice—including disciple-making. Likewise, tools amplify what language describes; civilizations are often defined by their tools.

As disciple-makers, the language and tools we select (and how well we teach them) are essential for fruitfulness.

---

### Jesus’ Language

Jesus was a master of memorable phrases, embedding meaning in statements that still linger today. Consider:

- “I have come that you might have life and have it to the full.” (John 10:10)
- “I have come not to be served, but to serve.” (Matthew 20:28)
- “Repent and believe!” (Mark 1:15)
- “Love your enemies and pray for those who curse you.” (Matthew 5:44)
- “For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.” (Luke 9:24)
- “Let him who is without sin throw the first stone.” (John 8:7)

---

### Jesus’ Tools

While Jesus was a carpenter by trade, his disciple-making toolkit was even more impressive:

#### 1. **Practices**
   - Scripture Engagement
   - Prayer (various forms)
   - Fasting
   - Sabbath Rhythms
   - Ordered relational world
   - Gospel Proclamation (stories/messages)
   - Gospel Demonstration (signs, service)
   - Intentionality with meals/parties

#### 2. **Parables**
   - Each parable functions as a picture, then a mirror, then a window, shaping meaning over time.

#### 3. **Procedures**
   - **Engagement/Retreat:** Intense mission, followed by solitude/rest.
   - **Action/Reflection:** Involving disciples, then leading reflection and correction.
   - **Teaching/Debrief:** After public teaching, gathering disciples privately to discuss and clarify.

---

#### KC Underground Example: Language

While Scripture is our first language, every faith community develops its own dialect. The following are phrases we seed into our disciple-making culture:

- The way of Jesus is our way.
- We exist to fill our city with the beauty, justice, and Good News of Jesus.
- Church is an extended spiritual family.
- A missionary on every street and a microchurch in every network.
- Character × Calling = Impact.
- God is Great, so we don’t have to be in control.
- God is Glorious, so we don’t have to be afraid.
- God is Good, so we don’t have to look elsewhere.
- God is Gracious, so we don’t have to earn it.
- Extraordinary Prayer and Fasting.
- Live Like a Missionary.
- Plant the Gospel.
- Look for the Person of Peace.
- Multiplying disciples, leaders, microchurches, hubs, and networks.
- Church is an identity, not an activity.
- We are sent.
- On mission where we live, work, learn, and play.

**Reflection:** Audit your language: What words and phrases reinforce or hinder robust disciple-making? What needs to be seeded or removed?

---

#### KC Underground Example: Tools

Our disciple-making tools are organized on a continuum:

- **Informal Tools**: Used in the harvest; e.g., Breath and BLESS rhythms, personal stories, and Discovery Bible Studies (DBS).
- **Shapes and Symbols**: Eleven visual tools serving as "visual parables," introducing key discipleship concepts.
- **Formal Tools**: Intentional Disciple-making Experiences (IDEs) such as Followers Made, Missionaries Made, Leaders Made, and Microchurch Learning Community. These are comprehensive, outcome-based transformation journeys.

For instance, DBS has fostered Gospel multiplication in contexts ranging from suburbs to jail systems.

**Resources:**  
Explore visual parables and tool samples at [kcunderground.org/resources](https://kcunderground.org/resources) and learn more about our IDEs at [disciplesmade.com](https://disciplesmade.com).

---

**Reflection Questions:**

- What would we discover by auditing our language?
- What words and phrases do we want to seed or remove?
- What tools do we use? How effective are they?
- What tools need retiring or introducing?
- How do we organize our tools?
- How do people know when and how to use each tool?

---

## Question #4: The Vehicles Question

**What are the relational environments?**

When Jesus said “Come, follow me,” he invited disciples into relationship, not programming. His discipleship was not compartmentalized into weekly classroom settings. Mark 3:14-15 tells us he chose the Twelve “that they might be with him,” rubbing off on each other as an extended family.

Fundamentally, the church is a family. In each relational environment, we must understand how disciple-making occurs and set healthy expectations.

### Five Key Relationships

1. **Public Relationships**: The gathered church for worship. ("Crowds")
2. **Social Relationships**: Networks engaging in mission and shared faith. ("The 72")
3. **Personal Relationships**: Small groups (6-16) of regular challenge and encouragement. ("The 12")
4. **Transparent Relationships**: Triads/quads (3-4) sharing life and accountability. ("The 3")
5. **The Divine Relationship**: Direct relationship with Jesus via the Holy Spirit. ("Father")

---

#### KC Underground Relational Environments

- **Collective Gatherings**: Network of 4–6 microchurches meeting regionally.
- **Hub Equipping Gatherings** (Social Space): Vision, storytelling, worship, prayer, and equipping for missionaries and microchurch leaders.
- **Microchurches**: Extended spiritual families living on mission.
- **Discovery Bible Studies (DBS)**: Personal relationships engaging in Scripture together.
- **Intentional Disciple-Making Environments**: Followers Made, Leaders Made, etc.—structured journeys for growth.
- **Time Alone with Jesus**: Encouragement and equipping for personal spiritual practices.

Over time, participants nest these relational experiences within their microchurch, collective, and hub—deepening roots in a singular network or neighborhood.

---

**Reflection Questions:**

- To what degree is our disciple-making system programmatic versus organic and relational?
- What are our relational environments? Evaluate:
    - Do they move people toward spiritual extended families?
    - Do they integrate all five social spaces?
    - Are any relational environments stagnant or toxic? Why?
    - Should any vehicles be retired or restored? What do we need to add?

---

## Question #5: The Voyage Question

**What is the direction and destination of the journey?**

Reflection on journey and destination is essential. Many frameworks exist:

### Stages of Growth

- **Jim Putman**:  
  1. Spiritually Dead  
  2. Spiritual Infant  
  3. Spiritual Child  
  4. Young Adult  
  5. Parent

- **Peter’s Prototype**:  
  - Come and See (Explore)  
  - Come and Follow (Develop)  
  - Feed My Sheep (Lead & Multiply)

- **Robert Coleman’s Master Plan**:  
  1. Selection  
  2. Association  
  3. Consecration  
  4. Impartation  
  5. Demonstration  
  6. Delegation  
  7. Supervision  
  8. Reproduction

- **Dan Spader’s Four Chair Discipling Model**

- **T4T Four Fields**:  
  1. Engaging the Lost  
  2. Sharing the Gospel  
  3. Making Disciples  
  4. Church Formation

---

### KC Underground Examples

#### Example 1: The Missionary Pathway

A pattern for disciple journey in new missionary contexts:

1. **Extraordinary Prayer & Fasting**: The foundation, always at work.
2. **Live Like a Missionary**: Identify missional focus; practice BLESS rhythms.
3. **Plant the Gospel**: Proclaim good news; engage Scripture for discovery and obedience.
4. **Microchurch Emerges**: Multiplying disciples leads to new faith communities.
5. **Multiplication**: DNA for multiplication is embedded at every level.

#### Example 2: The IDE Journey

A three-year, phased journey through four Intentional Disciple-Making Experiences:

- **Followers Made**: Six months; focuses on character and calling.
- **Leaders Made**: Ten months; deeper leadership and spiritual formation.
- **Missionaries Made**: Three months; forms missionary habits (BLESS rhythms).
- **Microchurch Learning Community**: Year-long; equipping to lead extended spiritual families.

#### Example 3: Harvest to Church, Church to Harvest

A cyclical framework: informal tools (win), shapes & symbols (build/equip), formal tools (equip/multiply), always pushing both ways between harvest and church.

---

**Reflection Questions:**

- How would you describe the journey and destination of your disciple-making ecosystem?
- What are its stages and phases?
- How clearly do participants understand these phases?
- How well has your journey been informed by Scripture and the church’s history?

# Chapter 14: Process & Systems

> "The complexity of systems requires that we engage everybody just so we can harvest the intelligence that exists throughout the organization."
> —Margaret Wheatley, _Finding Our Way_

The Earth, intricately organized by the Spirit of God, offers clues for building movemental organizations: its beauty and complexity is self-regulating. Movements, like rivers, rely on strong currents beneath the surface—substantive processes build lasting momentum. The real power is often unseen.

## The Power of Collective Intelligence

The story of Jasper, a hospital worker, illustrates the life-saving potential of allowing all voices in a system to contribute. His observation—nurses weren’t using gloves due to lack of stock in their size—led to a 70% reduction in patient mortality in a year. Jasper’s solution arose from front-line knowledge, emphasizing that every part of an organization contains valuable information.

**Takeaway:**  
An effective system taps into knowledge distributed across its members. The central nervous system of any organization is the people themselves—when each part works properly, the whole body grows in love (Ephesians 4:16).

---

## Inclusive Processes

Effective systems invite widespread participation. Margaret Wheatley notes that mechanistic processes divide us, fracturing trust. We need processes that reweave connections and tap into our natural ability to network and share meaning.

---

## Organizational Case Studies

**General Motors (GM)** once ran rigid, top-down assembly lines, punishing trouble. In contrast, Toyota invited every worker’s input, flattening hierarchy and encouraging autonomy. They implemented 100% of suggestions, creating collective ownership and innovation. The result: staggering improvements in productivity and staff empowerment.

Similarly, in church systems, flattening hierarchy and distributing decision-making yields greater creativity and engagement, aligning everyone around a shared vision.

---

## Towards Distributed Leadership

Rejecting hierarchical, “head” models and instead seeing leadership as distributed within the Body of Christ aligns with Scripture: Christ alone is the head. When every person’s gifts are honored and activated, the community thrives.

**Relational Intelligence,** as taught by Daniel Goleman, is essential for this:  
- Self-awareness
- Self-regulation
- Motivation
- Empathy
- Social skills

This increases trust and love in every relationship, broadening organizational influence.

---

## Staying Curious and Motivated

Our brains (the “seeking system”) are wired to crave interest, curiosity, and higher meaning (Daniel Cable). Effective systems arrange for discovery and participation, tapping into that drive for engagement and growth.

---

## Role-Based Titles and Agility

Pigeonholing through narrow titles (e.g., “head pastor”) limits flexibility and growth. A player like Babe Ruth was both a great pitcher and hitter—don’t restrict gifted individuals by rigid roles. Everyone’s contribution matters.

---

**End Reflection:**  
As you cultivate environments and ecosystems for disciple- and leader-multiplication, remember:  
*“Everything rises and falls on our disciple-making systems. If your disciples and leaders are healthy, you’ll produce healthy, multiplying communities. Then, you’ll have a movement on your hands.”*

Continue exploring how to bring together the collective genius of a decentralized network for wise decision-making and a bright future.
