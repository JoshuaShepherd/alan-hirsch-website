---# Transformative Spiritual Practices: Joining the Movement of God

> "Sow with a view to righteousness, Reap in accordance with kindness; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the Lord."  
> — Hosea 10:12

## Catching the Wind of God

Spiritual practices place us in a posture to see where God is moving, where grace is flowing, and to join in. Such activities are similar to:

- **Raising the sail**: Positioning ourselves to catch the wind of God.
- **Tuning the radio**: Staying attentive so we can always hear the divine music and join the dance.
- **Getting in the boat and rowing**: Recognizing that an undercurrent is always flowing beneath us.

The wind is blowing; we need to learn to raise our sail. The music is playing; we need to tune in. The current is flowing; we need to learn how to get in the flow.

When these spiritual practices become habits, we join the Spirit—regularly and intentionally—in the process of transformation, manifested in both character and calling.

## Jesus: The Ultimate Example of the Habit-Fueled Life

Jesus’ life epitomizes a habit-fueled life. He not only engaged in certain practices but built the rhythms of his life around them:

- **Solitude**: Retreating into creation for reflection.
- **Prayer**: Rising early to be alone with the Father, to remember his identity.
- **Scripture Engagement**: Immersing his mind to recall the Story only he could fulfill.
- **Community**: Engaging in multiple levels of mission-focused community for support and accountability.
- **Blessing Others**: Listening, eating, serving, and teaching as a lifestyle.
- **Work and Rest**: Practicing a rhythm of labor and real, restorative rest.

> "Come to me. Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace."  
> — Matthew 11:29 (The Message)

Jesus' practices became habits that structured the rhythms of his days, weeks, and years. If the Son of God lived a habit-fueled life, how much more do we need to do the same?

## Cultivating Spiritual Practices in Community

Within the Kansas City Underground Church, we guide people intentionally through engaging the following practices of Jesus and the early church:

### Core Spiritual Practices

1. **Daily Scripture Engagement**
   - Encourage self-discovery, immediate application, and sharing through methods like Discovery Bible Study.
2. **Prayer**
   - Blending contemplative (listening, silence, centering) and missional (intercession) prayer.
3. **Healthy Accountability**
   - Utilizing triads and groups of twelve trusted companions for proactive support and encouragement.
4. **Active Service**
   - Serving actively in one's immediate community.
5. **Journaling**
   - Capturing learning, prayers, and goals.
6. **Sabbath**
   - Practicing and planning for rhythms of work and rest.
7. **Gospel Fluency**
   - Learning to speak and apply the Gospel to deep needs.
8. **Relational Rhythms**
   - Fostering all five social spaces (Crowds, Social, Personal, Intimate, and Divine) through microchurch extended families.
9. **Calling Discovery and Optimization**
   - Regular gift assessment and feedback (GPS).
10. **Missional Engagement**
    - Practicing Breathe and BLESS Rhythms in neighborhoods or networks.

### The BREATHE and BLESS Rhythms

- **Begin in Prayer**
  - Breathe in: Listening Prayer
  - Breathe out: Missional Prayer
- **Listen and Engage**
  - Breathe in: Listen to neighbors
  - Breathe out: Engage relationally
- **Eat**
  - Breathe in: Eat with spiritual family
  - Breathe out: Party with others in your network or neighborhood
- **Serve**
  - Breathe in: Be served by a Person of Peace
  - Breathe out: Serve your network or neighborhood
- **Story**
  - Breathe in: Speak the Good News to yourself
  - Breathe out: Share how Jesus and the Gospel have changed you

## Developing Habits: The Process

Developing these practices can feel awkward, like learning to ride a bike—wobbly and inconsistent at first. Training wheels of time, support, and practice are needed for these to become life-giving habits. As in any apprenticeship, practices build upon each other, which is why we’ve created four different IOEs (Intentional Disciple-Making Environments), ranging from three to twelve months, for incremental development:

### Summary of Our IOEs

- **Followers Made**: Six months to discover character and calling, equipping you to be and make disciples.
- **Leaders Made**: Twelve months to develop a servant leadership mindset and lead a community on mission.
- **Missionaries Made**: Three months to cultivate a missionary lifestyle in daily life.
- **Microchurch Learning Community**: Twelve months of step-by-step training to plant a simple form of church as an extended family on mission.

Participants join a cohort (~12 people, plus a guide), practice a specific set of habits, and are equipped to empower others. People evaluate themselves monthly on transformation in character, calling, and associated habits, with results accessible via the **Disciples Made** app, promoting support and accountability.

## Results: Transformation and Multiplication

Disciples Made has helped transform a small handful into a movement of thousands. In the past year alone, the number of microchurches in KC Underground increased by 400%. These are not offshoots of a large church’s weekend services—these are missionaries sent to make new disciples in new contexts, forming new spiritual extended families. This way of life is costly and not for the faint of heart, but we attribute this multiplication to three things:

1. Extraordinary prayer and fasting
2. Increased focus on hearing the Voice of God
3. Widespread participation in one or more of the four IOEs

Our missionaries are learning the ways of Jesus in community, on mission, with a focus on the Spirit’s outcomes.

### Questions for Faith Leaders

- How effectively do we help people develop personally meaningful practices of faith?
- How effectively do we help people develop sacred rhythms that nourish mind and soul?
- Do we provide experiential pathways for faith habits, equipping people to share them with others?
- Do we create relational and mentoring environments for apprenticeship in spiritual practice?

# Community-Forged: Owner-Making Ingredient #3

## The Purpose of Spiritual Community

The goal of spiritual formation is not simply engagement in religious activity or service attendance. Instead, it is *outcome-focused transformation*—changing our character toward the likeness of God and deployment into our personal calling.

- Content alone doesn’t change us; we need clarity on our faith fractal—the irreducible minimum of our faith content, informing all of life.
- Our lives must be arranged around spiritual practices that keep us in the flow of God’s transforming grace.
- However, the impact of these ingredients is not realized without being *Community-Forged* and *Mission-Fixated*.

### Metaphor: The Bowl and Water

Content, outcomes, and habits are like water; community and mission form the bowl. Without the container of community on mission, the water spills and our thirst remains unquenched.

## The Apprenticeship of Transformation

All faith traditions have viewed spiritual formation as an apprenticeship—a journey toward mastery guided by those ahead of us. Transformation is fostered by:
- Imitation in relationship
- A framework of interwoven connections

### The Wood Wide Web

Just as trees in a forest thrive through intertwined roots, we are too shallow to grow alone; transformation is forged in community.

### Cultural Challenges

Most relationships today are scattered, busy, and temporary, leading to a wobbly, thin relational world. Intentional Owner-Making Environments reorder our relationships through the study of proxemics—the spatial dynamics of human community.

#### Five Social Spaces (Harrington & Absalom, Building on Hall & Myers)
1. **Crowd** (100+): Shared experiences, resources
2. **Social** (70+): Events, parties, affinity-based
3. **Personal** (12): Team, support, challenge, closeness
4. **Intimate** (3): Deep trust, transparency, openness
5. **Divine** (1): Union with God at the center

Jesus modeled each of these spaces—engaging in crowds, extended groups, intimate circles, and divine communion.

#### Key Observations for Faith Leaders

- **We Need All Five Social Contexts**: Each nourishes a specific aspect of transformation.
- **Overlapping Circles Enhance Cohesion**: Relational depth and community are most powerful when personal, social, and transparent contexts overlap.
- **Diversity in Relationships is Essential**: Jesus' circles included a range of backgrounds and beliefs.
- **Shared Mission and Values Increase Toward the Center**: The closer to the core (the 3 and the 12), the greater the alignment to mission and values.

#### Real-World Example: Neighborhood Transformation

Intentional rhythms of neighborly love can create authentic community, changing not just individuals but neighborhood cultures.

### Community-Forged Questions

- Do we understand and engage all five spheres of community required for human flourishing?
- How well do we help people create overlapping social spaces that deepen their engagement?
- How effectively do we move people beyond privatized individualism into deep, meaningful community?

# Mission-Fixated: Owner-Making Ingredient #4

## Rethinking Mission

Mission is not a department or an add-on but the heart of God and the identity of His people. Mission is woven into the nature of God:

- The Father sent Israel.
- The Father sent the Son.
- The Father, Son, and Spirit send the Church.

> "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise...not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."  
> — 2 Peter 3:9

Mission is the sweeping force animating redemptive history. Jesus is the fullest expression of a missionary God—"The Word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighborhood" (John 1:14, The Message).

### The Nature of Mission

Mission is *first* about identity, not activity. We serve a missionary God who calls us to be a missionary people. Disciples become lifeless souvenirs when not engaging in mission, like starfish outside their habitat.

#### Mission as the Best Environment for Owner-Making

Engagement in mission is essential for spiritual maturity. Like soldiers who mature in battle, disciples mature through active, local mission.

Mission starts right where you live, work, learn, or play—not just in far-off places. God is already at work wherever you are. We must awaken people from insular living and encourage them to see themselves as sent agents of healing and hope.

- *To whom have you been sent?* 
- *What is your calling?*

Mission is identification, not just involvement. We join God by identifying with the people He is already among.

#### Simple Tools for Missional Living

Consistent small interventions, such as BREATHE and BLESS rhythms, within one focused community, over time, create significant impact.

### Mission-Fixated Questions

- How well do we help each person discover that the mission of faith involves everyday spaces?
- How well do we help each person own the issues of mission personally?
- What resources, processes, and tools do we provide to empower personal ownership, application, and innovation in mission?

# Content-Flavored: Owner-Making Ingredient #5

## The Role of Content

While doctrine and content are critical, they alone do not transform. Outcome-focused, Spirit-empowered transformation—fueled by habits, forged in community, within the context of mission—is what shifts lives.

> "You will know the truth and the truth will set you free."  
> — John 8:32

The *purpose* of truth is freedom, not accumulation of knowledge.

### The Faith Fractal: Our Irreducible Minimum

A fractal is the simplest, repeating pattern—the DNA—of any living system. For effective spiritual formation, every community must know and communicate its fractal or irreducible minimum.

#### Examples:

- **Jesus' Fractal**: Love God and love your neighbor; the central theme is the Kingdom of God.
- **Early Church**: The proclamation "Jesus is Lord" and the message of the Kingdom of God.
- **Historic Creeds**: The Apostles’ Creed functions as a faith fractal—twelve core beliefs.
- **Hebrew Tradition**: The Shema—"Listen, Israel...love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and might" (Deut. 6:4-5).

The fractal replaces compartmentalized religion with a life-saturating framework, becoming the operating system for all of life, not merely another box to "add on."

### From Content to Core Conviction

Catholic philosopher Michael Novak identifies three levels of convictions:

1. **Public Convictions**: What we want others to think we believe.
2. **Private Convictions**: What we think we believe but may not in practice.
3. **Core Convictions**: The beliefs revealed by our actions.

The aim is for our core convictions to be flavored by our faith fractal. This requires both learning and acting according to the fractal, integrating it into our daily lives.

### Content-Flavored Questions

- Do we have clarity on our faith fractal—our irreducible minimum?
- How well do we pass on this fractal in a way that is generous, inclusive, and integrates into all of life?

# The Owner-Making Ecosystem Starfish

> "A business ecosystem is just like the natural ecosystem; first, needs to be understood, then, needs to be well planned, and also needs to be thoughtfully renewed as well."  
> — Pearl Zhu, *Digital Maturity*

## Understanding the Ecosystem

Owners of the faith (disciples) function as a "keystone species"—essential for the flourishing and multiplying of shalom in homes, neighborhoods, and communities.

Ecosystems are intricate networks—small, strategic changes can create an avalanche of positive transformation.

### The Five Ecosystem Questions

The **Owner-Making Ecosystem Starfish** offers five questions for faith community leaders to consider:

1. **The Vision Question**: What is your definition of a disciple?
    - If all discipleship activities are labeled as such, but the definition remains unclear, transformation cannot happen.

*Note: The remaining questions are referenced but not included in the provided text. Leaders are encouraged to use these questions to examine and recalibrate their ecosystems.*

# Next Steps for Faith Leaders

As a leader of a faith community or organization, reflect on the five ingredients:

- Outcome-focused
- Habit-fueled
- Community-forged
- Mission-fixated
- Content-flavored

**Journal through the questions in each section. Evaluate your current environments, leadership development, and team-building tools and resources. Identify any missing ingredients—and take steps to integrate them.**

---

## Epilogue: The Impact of Missing Ingredients

Just as a cookie without enough baking soda falls flat, a disciple-making environment missing one or more ingredients yields less transformation. Add all the ingredients and "watch people rise to new levels of transformation and impact."
